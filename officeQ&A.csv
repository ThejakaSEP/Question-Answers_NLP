154,Are we going?  [Dwight puts four fingers in front of the camera to start a countdown] Don't do that. Just say action when we're ready.,"Dunder Mifflin, Michael Scott, Diversity Tomorrow, take four. And action."
155,"Hi. I'm Michael Scott. I'm in charge of Dunder Mifflin Paper Products here in Scranton, Pennsylvania but I'm also the founder of Diversity Tomorrow, because today is almost over. Abraham Lincoln once said that, 'If you're a racist, I will attack you with the North.' And those are the principles... Damn it. Okay, sorry. Don't laugh; please don't laugh this time Dwight.

157,[wandering around the room during his diversity exercise] I want you to push it. I want you to push 'cause breakthroughs are right around the corner. Something's going to pop here. Something's going to pop between a party. Feel what it's like to be in someone else's skin. What does it feel like to be a different race? It feels pretty bad doesn't it. So let that come out.,"Yeah, I marched on Washington back in the day. I went to the Washington Monument and the Lincoln Memorial, U.S. Mint, congressman talked to our class. It was pretty cool."
158,"Um, what's going on here?",People treat us like the race on our forehead. And then we guess what race we are.
159,"Oh, man, am I a woman?","Yes, yes."

166,"No. But I am, I am human, right? [Pam hesitates]",[Dwight's new race is 'Dwight'] I could be French.
167,"Oh, okay. Here we go, breakthrough radar. What happened? What happened here?",It didn't have anything to do with race.

Kelly thank you. [claps] She's not here, but she gets it. That's what we have been looking for. The whole time. [trying not to cry] Oh, man. This is what I thrive on. You know?

173,Lay them on me. What?,There's nothing new.
174,"The most sacred thing I do is care and provide for my workers, my family. I give them money. I give them food. Not directly, but through the money. I heal them. Today, I am in charge of picking a great new health care plan. Right? That's what this is all about. Does that make me their doctor? Um... Yes, in a way. Yeah, like a specialist.","So, which health plan have you decided on?"
175,"So, which health plan have you decided on?","I am going to go with the best, Jan. I am going to go with the one with the acupuncture, therapeutic massage, you know, the works."
176,"Wait, acupuncture? None of the plans have acupuncture. Have you looked at them closely Michael?",I think it was you who didn't look closely enough at the Gold Plan.
177,The Gold Plan? I'm not even on that plan.,"Well, I'd recommend it. It's very good."
178,[scoffs] When have you ever done that?,I'm doing it right now. To you.

182,Really?,"Yeah. I just don't think this is the kind of task, that I... am going to do. You know who would be great for this?"
183,"Yeah. I just don't think this is the kind of task, that I... am going to do. You know who would be great for this?","Any time Michael asks me to do anything, I just tell him that Dwight should do it."
184,"OK, first, let's go over some parameters. How many people can I fire?","Ah, none. You're picking a health care plan."
185,What did I do? I did my job. I slashed benefits to the bone. I saved this company money. Was I too harsh? Maybe. I don't believe in coddling people.,"In the wild, there is no health care. In the wild, health care is, 'Ow, I hurt my leg. I can't run. A lion eats me and I'm dead.' Well, I'm not dead. I'm the lion. You're dead."
186,"[on phone] Pam, Michael Scott. How's tricks?",Where are you?
187,Where are you?,"Oh, I am in my office. I am swamped. I have work up to my ears I'm busy, busy, busy. Can't step away. I just wanted to check in and see how everybody's doing. Everybody cool out there?"

189,"I have to make a call after I finish... my work. You know what? Uh, just don't let anybody in my office under any conditions today. I'm just too busy. Too swamped, you know? I am unreachable. I am incommunicado, capisce?",OK.
190,"If it's the same thing, then why did you write 'workspace'?","Just knock, Please? As a sign of respect for your superior."
191,"Just knock, Please? As a sign of respect for your superior.",You are not my superior.
192,"Oh gee, then why do I have an office?",I thought it was a workspace?
193,I thought it was a workspace?,OK. Dwight. Are you really in charge of picking the health care plan?
194,OK. Dwight. Are you really in charge of picking the health care plan?,Yes. And my decision in final.

202,Is it a good plan?,It's a great plan. It saves the company a fortune.
203,"Cuts? What? Wow, Dwight, did you make cuts?","Yeah, you said..."
204,"No, no , no, you know what? I said nothing specific because I was so busy. Why don't you go in there and find these people a plan that will work for them? OK?",I can handle that.
205,"OK? All right. Do we feel good? All right. Good. Plus, there's some other good news. Today, at the end of the day, I will have, for all of you, a big surprise. OK? So hang in there, and I will see you at the end of the day. Right?",This is not good.
206,It's ridiculous. Did you talk to him?,What was that?
207,What was that?,You let him walk all over you. It's just pathetic.
208,What are you guys talking about?,"Nothing, Kevin."
209,"Do I know what the surprise is? Hell no! It doesn't matter. The point is, they're not unhappy anymore. They're out there thinking, 'Wow, my boss really cares about me. He has a surprise. He's cool. I... what a great guy. I love him. I...","OK, everyone. Gather round. Step forward. It has been brought to my attention that some of you are unhappy with my plan. So what I'd like you to do is to fill this out and write down any diseases you have that you might want covered and I'll see what I can do."
210,"OK, you know what Dwight? We can't write our diseases down for you because that's confidential.","OK, well, I didn't say to write your name down, did I? Fill it out, leave it anonymous. Or, don't write any disease down at all and it won't be covered. Sound fair? Good. I'll be in my office."

214,"So, basically, I want to do something nice for my employees. Atlantic City, OK? They have this thing where they send a bus, right, for free. Picks everybody up, you head down there, get to the hotel, room is comped, they give you a pile of chips, and your food, everything just kind of all-inclusive, free kind of weekend.","I don't know of anything like that, but, um, you know what you might want to do, is just call those casinos directly. Um, maybe?"
215,"I don't know of anything like that, but, um, you know what you might want to do, is just call those casinos directly. Um, maybe?","Yeah, yeah, yeah. I did, so..."
216,Wait. What are you writing? Don't write Ebola or mad cow disease. Right? 'Cause I'm suffering from both.,I'm inventing new diseases.
217,"So, let's say my teeth turn to liquid and then, they drip down the back of my throat. What would you call that?",I thought you said you were inventing diseases? That's spontaneous dental hydroplosion.
218,I thought you said you were inventing diseases? That's spontaneous dental hydroplosion.,Nice.
219,You mean the elevator that takes you down into the mineshaft? It's not really a ride.,Its says here that it's a 300ft drop.
220,So it's not a free fall?,It's an industrial coal elevator.
221,"Uh, all right. Well, once you get down into the mine, what... you got laser tag or something?","OK, so I don't know what the surprise is. Am I worried? No. No way. See, I thrive on this. This is my world. This is improv. This is Whose Line is it Anyway?"

226,"Uh, leprosy? Flesh eating bacteria. Hot-dog fingers. Government-created killer nanorobot infection.","You did this, didn't you?"
227,"You did this, didn't you?",Absolutely not.
228,"I know it was you. Fine. You know what? I'll have to interview each and every one of you until the perpetrator makes him or herself known. And until that time, there will be no health care coverage for any one!",Killer nanorobots?
229,Killer nanorobots?,It's an epidemic.

246,From sales?,Well...
247,Where's Michael Scott?,He is not here right now. He put me in charge of the office.
248,"Dwight, listen to me very carefully. You are not a manager of anything. Understand?","That's not entirely true, because he put me in charge of picking the health care plan."

281,"Why do you want health care, Pam? Hmm? Why do you want it?",In case I get sick.
282,"Why don't you just go ahead and use Roy's health care plan, huh?",Because we're not married.

287,No. Was that the hard way?,I know you did.
288,"Well, then why are you wasting everybody else's time interrogating them?","Well, because I want to know who wrote those diseases down."
289,"One second 'cause that sounds really good. Is jackass one word or two? [Dwight sighs] One, right? 'Cause, 'cause of the show, it's one.",One word.
290,"I've really learned from the greats. The great improvisers, Drew Carey, Ryan Stiles, uh, the Brady guy not so much. He's more the signing, Wayne Brady. Um, Robin Williams.

He'll be half way through his step [snaps his fingers] And I will already be laughing at the punch line. He hasn't even gotten to it. He doesn't even know what it is it. So it's fun, you know it's fun having a mind that works like that. That is just a few steps ahead of... comedically ahead of like what's going on. Like I'll watch T.V. and I'll be watching a show and I will think, oh, I know someone's gonna walk in here right now and say something funny. And then they do. Or, um, I know they'll be like oh boy that person deserved to be slammed down. There's going to be some sort of insult. And there is. You know, there's like, 'Oh you're... God your butt is fat.' And I knew it. I know it's like I knew they were going to say that. I knew they were gonna go there. Don't go there. Um, but other...

354,"Speaking of which, I meant to tell you. Very impressive, the uh, donation you gave to Oscar's charity. What was it? 25 bucks?","Well, you know, money isn't everything Jim.

Maybe you'll give more than three dollars next time.","Yeah, well, three dollars a mile. It's gonna end up being like 50 bucks. So... God, I can't even calculate what you're gonna have to give."
356,Is Oscar around?,"I just thought it was kind of a flat, you know... 25 dollar, one-time donation. I didn't think it was per mile kinda deal. You know, so..."
357,"No, no, no, no, no. That wasn't what I wasn't, that wasn't... No. It-it-it's not about the money. It's just... it... it's the ethics of the thing, Oscar. How's your nephew? Is he in good shape?",Yeah.

368,[looking at Dwight] An alliance? What the hell is he talking about?,I have absolutely no idea.
369,"Do I feel bad about betraying Jim? Not at all. That's the game. Convince him we're in an alliance, get some information, throw him to the wolves.","[With blonde hair] That's politics baby. Get what you can out of someone, then crush them. I think Jim might have learned a very valuable lesson."

And when clients call and you're not smiling they can hear that in your voice. It is a real turnoff.",Are you being serious?
374,Are you being serious?,"Yes, I am, absolutely. So, the next call we get I'd like you to smile. I'd like to see a big smile."

493,"Isn't that crazy? I'm a Volunteer Sheriff's Deputy. Lackawanna County says that it's okay for me to perform CPR, but for Michael my lips aren't qualified enough for his perfect little face. It's nuts.",Is that really necessary?
494,Is that really necessary?,[wearing a face guard] I've almost had my nose broken a dozen times.
495,"You know what. I think most basketball movies are great movies. Because it's a great subject. There's one about a little kid who, um, joins a professional basketball team and he's really, really good and he can dunk and he's like 3 feet tall. And he can dunk the ball. That, oh, I love that movie. That movie kind of, that movie makes me cry. I don't like to cry on camera, but that movie makes me cry. Um, because it touches a cord in me about hoops. [Michael's free throw is really short] Short, short, short! And basketball is like jazz, you know. To like pertipify it there's a jazz musician, a guy, you know... if you know jazz you know who I mean. He's uh, God what was his name? Um, he plays one of those curly horns, like those really shiny curly horns that's used in jazz a lot.",[back to the basketball game] Let's go Lonny.
496,Are you listening to me Michael?,Affirmative.
497,What did I just say?,"You just said, let me uh... check my notes.  You just said..."
498,"Hey, hey how is Alan?  Tell Alan that the Mets suck! Okay? From me, big time. Go Pirates!",I'm not going to do that Michael.
499,"Whoa. Howdy-ho. Wow, a thousand big ones. That's cool. Do I uh, do I get to pick the prize?","Uh, yes. Yes you can."

I also uh, subscribe to USA Today and American Way Magazine, that's the in-flight magazine. Some great articles in that. They did this great profile last month of Doris Roberts and where she likes to eat when she's in Phoenix. Illuminating."
505,What?,"It's like a slang for Starbucks. They're all over the place. Oh, man, that place is like the promised land to me. What a business model too. Ah, too bad we don't have the good stuff here."
506,"No, here's the thing. Y'know I do my best to be my own man and go by the beat of a different drummer and nobody gets me, and they're always putting up walls and I'm always tearing 'em down, just breakin' down barriers, that's what I do all day.  So a coffee, regular coffee for you. High test, or unleaded?",Bring it on.
507,So are you jealous 'cause there's another girl around?,No.
508,So do you like the periwinkle and the purples?,"The purse girl hits everything on my checklist. Creamy skin. Straight teeth. Curly hair. Amazing breasts. Not for me, for my children. The Schrutes produce very thirsty babies."
509,"I have an idea.  Why don't I introduce you around, you know you can kind of get your foot in the door, meet potential clientele, right?","Gosh, I would love to but, my purses, I should, um..."

511,"Yeah, well, bladdy-bluda-blah-blah. Techno-babble. Just do it, okay. We have company. Right?","You should sell a lot here because this branch made over a million dollars last year. Not that we're all millionaires. I'm probably closest. So here's Oscar. Oscar, this is Katy."

523,"Well, you know what Dwight? He's your work boss, okay? He is not your relationship boss.",That's true.
524,"Guys are usually my best customers, they buy the high end stuff like the beads and the sequins and stuff. For gifts, you know?  They don't know what they are looking at. So I make suggestions.","Alright. Here's the thing okay, you just keep talking to her.  If you hit a stall you have a perfect fall back."
525,What's that?,You buy a purse.
526,"Dwight, that's not necessarily true. Do you read GQ?",No.
527,"Okay, I do. There like mini briefcases, alright?  Lots of guys have them.",Like those?
528,Like those?,"Yes. Listen, you are spending way too much time talking to me, when you could be talking to her."
529,"[mimicing Dwight in high-falsetto voice] Hi my name's Dwight Schrute and I would like to buy a purse from you. Good lord, look at these purses! This is something special. Oh my God is this Salvatore Di-chini-asta?","[mimicing Katy] Oh definitely, definitely step in and out of it like that."
530,"I'm going to be the prettiest girl in the ball.  Oh, how much?","Oh, God. It's sad. It's so sad."
531,"Yeah, what's that?",[laughs]
532,"I wished, right?","Giggle-giggle, juji-juji, I get it, I get it. Divine Secrets of the Ya Ya Sisterhood over here right?  [to Katy] So how's that uh, coffee from earlier?"

534,"Ah, I knew it. Guzzled it down. You greedy little thing.  So, uh, Pam is this your lunch break, or was that earlier when you were eating in the kitchen with those guys?",[whispers] Sorry.
535,Is that from Starbucks?,Yes. This is a Starbucks digital barista. This is the mack daddy of espresso makers.
536,Wow. Is that for the office?,"Oh, I know what you're thinking. You're not prying this out of my hands, but don't tempt me because I'll give it to you!"
537,"[Katy reading text message on her phone] Oh the rotating um, steam wand. [Katy looks annoyed] What? What's the matter?","Oh, nothing.  My ride just bailed on me."

539,Where you going? Nearby? Because I can give you a ride.,No...
540,At five?,"I can go earlier. 'Cause I'm the boss. You know, whatever. I'm out of here slaves."
541,What?,"Okay, I guess that would be, I guess that would be okay."
542,Michael could I ask you something? I wanted to ask your permission to ask out Katy. I know it's against the rules and everything. Because...,"No, no, no it's not against the rules.  She's not a permanent employee so it's not."
543,What?,She asked me for a ride and so I am going to give her a ride home.
544,Is that all it is? Just a ride home? Like a taxicab?,"Well, might be a ride home.  Might be a ride home and we stop for coffee and dot-dot-dot..."
545,"Please. Please, I am your inferior and I'm asking you this favor. Can you promise me that it will just be a ride home?",No. I cannot promise you that.
546,"You cannot promise me, or you won't promise me?","Listen, Dwight."
547,Do you love her?,"[laughs] Dwight, no. I don't know. It's too early to tell. I don't know how I feel. [Dwight sadly looks away]"

579,"That is cool. Well, I'll see you Monday though, right?",Great.
580,"I think in order to be a ladies man, it's imperative that people don't know you're a ladies man, so I kind of play that close to the chest. I don't know, what can I say? Women are attracted to power. And I think other people have told me that I have a very symmetrical face. [laughs] I don't know. I don't know. Maybe they're right?  I don't know.",Sure you don't want me to help you with that?  Cause I can grab that no problem.

583,"I don't know. Grab a drink, I think?",With us?
584,With us?,"I uh, I probably should have told you, I don't need a ride now 'cause Jim can take me home after so you're off the hook."
585,You got that?,"Oh, yeah. You sold a lot, so it's lighter."
586,"Alright now, I'm gonna warn you. Don't freak out, okay?",Why?
587,Why?,"This is a really nice car. In case you haven't noticed, this is a Corolla. Okay."
588,You're not going to freak out?,"Do I have a special someone?  Uh well, yeah of course. A bunch of 'em. My employees. If I had to choose between a one-night-stand with some stupid cow I pick-up in a bar, and these people? I'd pick them every time.  Because with them, it is an everyday stand and I still know their names in the morning."
589,"Do I have a special someone?  Uh well, yeah of course. A bunch of 'em. My employees. If I had to choose between a one-night-stand with some stupid cow I pick-up in a bar, and these people?

591,I knew it. Is it waterproof?,I'm not sure. It's faux snakeskin.

How much you paying her? What can, you can't even afford anything now, right? You're all right though, right? Don't ask me for a raise. [laughs] Cup of Soup's a good idea though. That'll... that's a good budgetary thing to do.",It's just a snack.

604,What do you think his chances are?,"Well, Pam I'm not gonna lie to you, he's chances are none. Um, he's 41 years old, he is losing his hair and his cell phone ring is 'Mambo #5.' So..."
605,"Yeah, was it 10? Yeah, I have it on a mix tape from junior high.",Went well?
606,Went well?,I think it did.

615,"Tonight is the Dundies, the annual employee awards night here at Dunder Mifflin. [holds up a trophy of a business man] And this is everybody's favorite day. Everybody looks forward to it, because, you know, a lot of the people here don't get trophies, very often. Like Meredith or Kevin, I mean, who's gonna give Kevin an award? Dunkin' Donuts? Plus, bonus, it's really, really funny. So I, you know, an employee will go home, and he'll tell his neighbor, 'Hey, did you get an award?' And the neighbor will say, 'No man. I mean, I slave all day and nobody notices me.' Next thing you know, employee smells something terrible coming from neighbor's house. Neighbor's hanged himself due to lack of recognition. So...","So, you ready for the... the Dundies?"
616,"So, you ready for the... the Dundies?",Ugh...

618,What?,[in Fat Albert voice] Fat Halpert. [in normal voice] Jim Halpert.
619,"So why don't I take you on a tour of past Dundie winners. We got Fat Jim Halpert here. Jim, why don't you show of your Dundies to the camera?","Oh, I can't because I keep them hidden. I don't want to look at them and get cocky."
620,"T.M.I.? Too much information. Ah, it's just easier to say T.M.I. I used to say 'Don't go there' but that's... lame.","And here we have Stanley the Manly. Now Stanley is a Dundie all-star, aren't you Stan? Why don't you, ah, show them some of your bling."
621,"And here we have Stanley the Manly. Now Stanley is a Dundie all-star, aren't you Stan? Why don't you, ah, show them some of your bling.","I don't know where they are, I think I threw them out."
622,"Say, we got to order some more apa-teezers this time.  We ran out last year, remember?","Yes we should. I... you know what?  I wanted one of those skillets of cheese, but when I got off stage, [turns to Kevin] someone had eaten all of them."
623,"Yes we should. I... you know what?  I wanted one of those skillets of cheese, but when I got off stage, [turns to Kevin] someone had eaten all of them.",[in video] To Oscar Martinez it's the 'Show Me the Money' award! Yeah!
624,"So, what's the joke? You're not perfect either.","We're not laughing at you, Dwight."
625,So who are we laughing at?,"Um, just something somebody wrote."
626,Who? Dave Barry?,"[laughing] No. No, just something that was written in the ladies' room wall."
627,What is it? Who wrote it?,"Um, it's kind of private."
628,"[talking to the speakerphone] Will her highness, Jan Levinson-Gould, be descending from her corporate throne this evening to visit us lowly serfs here at Dunder Mifflin Scranton?","[on speaker phone] It's a, it's, it's a two and a half hour drive from New York, Michael."
629,[to camera] Could you...?,Are you there Michael?
630,Are you there Michael?,"Yeah, I'm here, I just wanted to, uh, talk to you for a second about that."
631,Really? I'm dropping an atomic bomb on you?,"Well, yeah, I mean, what is..."
632,No reason?! It was the 05 05 05 party...,And you had a luau....
633,What were you doing in the ladies room?!,"...no, no, no, no, it's not what you think."
634,Why were you peering over the stalls?!,"No, why were you in there?!"
635,"No, why were you in there?!",You are a pervert!
636,What were you doing in there?,"You, are, a pervert!"
637,"Whoooo! When is that girl gonna get married? That's what I have to say. Ah, Roy's accepting.",[on video] Yes.
638,"[on video] Thank you Roy. Are there any words you'd like to say, on Pam's behalf?","[on video] Ah, w-we'll see you next year."
639,"No, it's hilarious, you're right. I just think, um, 'world's longest engagement', um, we're all expecting it, you know?","That's why it's funny. Every year that Roy and Pam don't get married, it gets funnier."
640,You're taking away our bathroom?,We are going to have two men's rooms.
641,But where would we...go?,Be prepared to hold folks [Michael comes out of his office] From 9 am to...
642,"Okay, look, I know there have been a lot of rumors flying around about the Dundies this year. How there is no money, and how there is no food, and how the jokes are really bad, but WHAT THE HELL EVERYBODY!? I mean, God. The Dundies are about the best, in every, one of us. Can't you see that? I mean, okay, we can do better. so, tonight, for the first time, we are inviting all of your friends and family to attend the awards with us.",[with a small fist pump] Yes!
643,"Yeah, not bad, right? So let's make this the best Dundies ever.",[clapping] Best Dundies ever.
644,"The Dundies, how can I explain it? Awards you like to hate it. I'm psyched you all made it. You never had to work so hard and feel that no one notices you.  You're just a name and number and no one even says hello.' [to Ryan] Card!","The Dundies are kind of like a kid's birthday party, and you go, and there's really nothing for you to do there. But the kid's having a really good time, so you're, kind of there. That's-that's kind of what it's like."
645,You down with The Dundies? You down with the Dundie-',The waitress tripped on the cord.
646,I did. And why didn't ya Stanley?,"I did, my wife's name is Terri."
647,Really? We don't have any girls from HR.,"No, that...for the sake of the story. And things were getting hot and heavy."
648,Yeah?,And I was about to take her bra off...
649,Like an AIDS test?,No! [under his breath] God.
650,"Um, guys, where you going? Pam, show's just getting started.",Sorry.
651,You staying?,"Yeah, gotta eat somewhere."
652,What? I told them busiest...idiots.,"It's, it's fine."
653,...talking about? He's a jackass every year.,No.
654,Hey! How are ya? I thought you left?,"Oh no, I just, I decided to stay."
655,Right? You know wat I'm talking 'bout.,[to an off camera waiter and still clutching Jim's beer] Can I get a drink?
656,[to an off camera waiter and still clutching Jim's beer] Can I get a drink?,"This next award goes to somebody, who really, lights up the office."
657,What am I going to do with the award? Nothing. I-I don't know what I'm going to do. That's the least of my...concerns right now.,"And the 'Tight Ass' award goes to Angela.  Not only because she is everybody's favorite stickler, but because she has, a great caboose.  So...come on down."
658,Second drink?,The 'Spicy Curry' award goes to our very own Kelly Kapoor!  Get on up here. Here you go.
659,"Spicy Curry', what's that mean?","Um, not everything means something, it's just a joke."
660,"Yeah, but why'd you give it to me?","I don't know, it's just..."
661,"Hey, thanks guys. Hey, where you guys from?",We just came from yo' mama's house.
662,What?,Nothing.
663,What?,"I don't know, what?"
664,"I don't know, what?",Oh my God! You are so drunk!
665,Did you get that? Please tell me you got that. This is all going to be on.,"Quick, quick, the woman is having a seizure. Grab her tongue, grab her tongue! It's okay, I'm a sheriff's deputy."
666,Don't get into that now. We need something to cushion her head. Throw pillow? A cush-,"Dwight come on, come-"
667,"Was this year's Dundies a success? Well, let's see, I made Pam laugh so hard, that she fell out of her chair, and she almost broke her neck. So I killed, almost.",Oh my God!
668,"Hey, um, can I ask you a question?",Shoot.
669,"TMI. Too much information. I used to say, 'Don't go there,' but that is so lame now. Or, 'You go, girl.' Or... Um, when did 'Where's the beef?' That was, like, a long, long time ago. It's funny how the shelf life of these things, like how long they last, like, 'Too much information' probably came on the scene... I mean, I didn't hear it till, like, this month, so it's pretty recently. Um, but you know, they're generally good for, like, no more than five or six years.","Yes, that's true. I have never won a Dundie. I am more than okay  with that."
670,What do we know about him? He's an accountant.,"He plays guitar, he likes naval history. He's a bowler."
671,"Really? What did they say? 'For a good time, call Michael Scott'?",Good one.
672,"Why do you think that? You just immediately go to that, Dwight? Why are you so negative? Why...",Michael.
673,Do you want me to find out what it says?,Yes.
674,By any means necessary?,What does that even mean? What are you... What are you talking about?
675,What does that even mean? What are you... What are you talking about?,It's the ladies' room.
676,What award would you like to give Dwight?,I hadn't planned on including him.
677,"Okay, I'll talk. You nod if I get it right. Does it have to do with his butt or his wiener?",I think his characters are pretty funny. Especially Ping.
678,"Well, what should I do, guys? Seriously, do you want me to just cancel the Dundies?","No, we were just hoping you wouldn't do those characters, like last time."
679,Ping? Everybody loves Ping. He's my most popular character.,I think many people find that character slightly racist.
680,"Really? Well, he is based on the Chinese delivery guy that I have, who talks exactly like that, so, I think you should take it up with him instead of me.","Look, I'm just saying that there are many people that are offered by your insensitive skits."
681,"[sighs] Well, neither of you are Chinese, so what... Why do you care?","Dwight, get out of here!"
682,What?,That is not true.
683,"What do you think, Phyllis? You think I followed you in there? Like, 'Oh good. Phyllis is going to the bathroom, so maybe I get to see her naked from the waist down.' I'm not even attracted to you.",That is a good point.
684,When?,"Oh, I don't know. Maybe after I finish writing, producing, directing, and hosting your awards show. All right, just relax, keep your pants on.

1065,"That's just a figure of speech, you know? Blow your brains out? Come on. All it really means is that we're friends. Who else is she gonna talk to if I'm gone, right? I mean, if she left, I wouldn't blow my brains out. Of course, I would take that job in Maryland. Because it's double the pay, and soft shell crab just happens to be my favorite food.","I  love Halloween. You know, it's just, it's just fun. Every year, it's just fun.

1076,"Michael, do you have the name of the employee you're letting go? I'd like to start working on out-placement.","Fine. If you are so anxious to see a head roll, it's you. There. You brought it on yourself. Too bad. Can't say that I'm sorry. It's a relief."
1077,"You asked for a name, I gave you a name. Now you're not doing your job. Why don't you just resign?",They would just send someone else. You need to have an HR representative.

1084,"I have a proposal, everybody. Listen up. Now, Corporate has been really breathing down my neck to make some pay cuts, but I refuse to fire anyone.

1085,"Leave me alone, okay?",Do you want some coffee?
1086,Do you want some coffee?,"No, no. I had some, thanks."
1087,"[slurping] Oh, wow. How long have you worked here? How many years, Creed?","Fifteen years, I think."

That's good eating, though. Venison's very gamey. It's hard to watch, though. It's hard to... It's hard to hit another living thing in the face with a shovel for about an hour. That... I haven't been hunting since then. I, I... 'Cause that's, you know, where's the joy in that? Where's the... There's no sport, really. Especially when you're the one with the shovel. And they're the one just lying there. Um... I would have rather hit it with my car or something and just... I was just smacking the hell out of that thing. That was a mess. And we just left him there. I didn't eat it. I didn't want to eat that. That guy. Why do you ask?",[on the phone] This is Jan.
1094,Excuse me?,The human being man's name was Devon.
1095,"The person that you fired, Michael?","Yes, it is."

1107,Why is that secret? [Pam knocks and walks into Michael's office],"[to Pam] Hello, oh God, busy work. Ahh, get away, cretin."
1108,"Last year they were out of order, weren't they Pam?","Well, the last pick-up for overnight deliveries is at seven. So you need to have them signed by then. Or much earlier."
1109,"Well, is that really a priority?","Is it a priority? Oh I don't know, um, what if there is a tornado, Pam? People's legs are crushed under rubble. 'Please, would you be so kind as to call my wife? No, I can't because we don't have any emergency contact information because Pam said it wasn't a priority.' Think. Think with your head, Pam. Ok, well. She walks out. That's the problem with being a boss is that when you are tough they resent you and when you are cool they walk all over you."

1123,"Ok, Roy?",Warehouse guy. Doesn't count.
1124,Ok. Michael? Could you beat up Michael?,"Yeah, yeah, I don't think that would happen."

1126,"Uh, how did you know they were black belts?","They told me. After. You see, I used to run with a very tough crowd. Street Fighter types. Real, real bad people, I'm just lucky I got out."
1127,Is your wife still your contact?,"Um, ex-wife. Yeah. Um, her last name is 'Becker' now."

1129,You were a Jet?,Have you signed the expense reports yet?
1130,Have you signed the expense reports yet?,"Yes, in theory, I have. I just need to cross some t's and dot some i's. Alright, I'm going to be in my office if anybody needs me. [Puts Dwight in a headlock] Hoo-hah. Oh, wow, sleeper hold. That's my rebuttal. Shhh. Hoo. You are the weakest link."
1131,You know a ton of fourteen year old girls?,What belt are they?
1132,What belt are they?,"Look, Dwight is a wuss. When we rented 'Armageddon'..."

1136,French Onion?,Obviously.
1137,"I haven't signed them, ok?","No, it's not that. Um, I was just wondering, since I'm probably going to have to stay late, could you ask Dwight to stay late too so he can walk me to my car?"
1138,"No, it's not that. Um, I was just wondering, since I'm probably going to have to stay late, could you ask Dwight to stay late too so he can walk me to my car?","Come in. Um, Pam, I hate to break this to you but Dwight can't stop you from being mugged. He's just not tough enough."
1139,"Oh, so that's what they are saying?",Yeah.
1140,"Ok, alright, where is Dwight?","Uh, Kitchen."
1141,What?,"Watch out Kelly, he might sucker punch you."
1142,"No, Really?","In case you remember, I was defending my honor... like a samurai."
1143,"Really? Well, the offer, Dwight, was for one punch which I absorbed. I had no idea that there would be a second punch. So, catch-22.","Ok, fine. Tit for tit. Give it your best shot. Two punches. Go!"
1144,Really?,Yeah.
1145,You know what? You're just lucky that we are at work right now.,"Ooh, what about, uh,  Dwight's dojo?"
1146,"Ooh, what about, uh,  Dwight's dojo?","No, they must have class."
1147,Any word on those time cards?,"I've got an idea: why don't you leave right now. Why don't you walk away from the room, 'kay? Fine. We'll go at lunch. Pam, make an announcement. Figure out carpools."
1148,"I've got an idea: why don't you leave right now. Why don't you walk away from the room, 'kay? Fine. We'll go at lunch. Pam, make an announcement. Figure out carpools.","Um, well, we are all getting excited to see this fight. The Albany branch is working right through lunch to prevent downsizing, but Michael, he decided to extend our lunch by an hour so we could all go down to the dojo and watch him fight Dwight. Fight... Fight, fight, fight, fight, fight, fight, I'm coming, fight..."
1149,What?,Your love line- I'm just kidding. I can't see anything.
1150,"What, what are you going to do? Bring it, Beesley. Bring it. Oh yeah, good move. Not such an ultimate fighter now.","Hey, put me down. Put me down. [Meredith turns and looks at Jim and Pam] Oh my god, hey, put me down. Hey..."
1151,"Ok, gentlemen, listen up. After a clean strike to the chest, stomach, or kidneys, I will separate you and award a point. The first person to three wins. Alright?","Yes, Sensei!"

1153,"Play dirty, huh? Ok, game on, man.",Sweep the leg.
1154,"You talkin' to me? You talkin' to me? 'Raging Bull.' Pacino. Oh, I want that footage. I want it. I need it. Ah, I have to get back to work. I have lots of work... Oh, oh check this out. Come here. [Michael opens his blinds and looks at Ryan in the parking lot] There he is. Mr. Temp. Having lunch by the car. Let us play with him. This'll be hilarious. [Calls Ryan on the phone, Ryan doesn't pick up after seeing that Michael is calling] Oh, we're playing phone tag.","Seven new messages. First New Message. [Michael's voice] 'Hi, Ryan. This is Saddam Hussein.' Next new message. 'Hi, Ryan. This is your girlfriend... and I'm mad!'"

1158,"Ok, to what?",Just put 'The Hospital.' Contact number: just put 9-1-1. [Dwight leaves]
1159,"Yeah, just throw them on the chair. I'll take it from here. So, whatcha up to this weekend?","Uh, hanging out with some friends, probably."
1160,Dwight?,"Michael, did you finish yet?"
1161,"Michael, did you finish yet?","This close. Dwight, may I speak with you for a minute?"
1162,"This close. Dwight, may I speak with you for a minute?",I'm busy.
1163,"I know, but I've been carrying the load on my back all day, and if everybody would just chip in a little bit, it'd might help me out. What do you say? Let's gangbang this thing and go home. Good? Dwight.",This is illegal.
1164,I have been testing you the entire day. Did you know that?,Of course.
1165,"I told Dwight that there is honor in losing. Which, as we all know, is completely ridiculous, but there is, however, honor in making a loser feel better which is what I just did for Dwight. Would I rather be feared or loved? Um, easy. Both. I want people to be afraid of how much they love me. And I think I proved that today at the dojo.",[Dwight grunts] Great. Excellent. [Dwight yells] All right. That's okay.
1166,"Do I feel bad that I haven't bonded with the other students? No, I'm not there to make friends. I'm there to attack people.",What about Oscar? Could you beat Oscar?
1167,What about Oscar? Could you beat Oscar?,No problem.
1168,Okay. Michael. Could you beat up Michael?,"Yeah, I don't think that would happen. See, I used to run with a very tough crowd, street fighter types. Real, real bad people. I'm just lucky I got out. I was a bad ass mo-fo. Stanley knows what I'm talking about."
1169,Excuse me?,I've never lost a fight. You know why? My motto. Never say die.
1170,I've never lost a fight. You know why? My motto. Never say die.,You just said it. You just said it.
1171,Do you think he's signed them yet?,Signed what?
1172,Signed what?,Forget it. Is that chocolate-vanilla swirl?
1173,Forget it. Is that chocolate-vanilla swirl?,"Just chocolate. Angela? For the last time, I did not eat your chocolate-vanilla swirl."

1176,"Do you have, do you have anything in, like, black?","Okay. Gentlemen. [to Michael] You ready? [to both Michael and Dwight] Okay, listen up."
1177,"Okay. Gentlemen. [to Michael] You ready? [to both Michael and Dwight] Okay, listen up.","Hi, sensei. Hi, Dwight."
1178,Alyssa? I guess she's technically the senpai. But nobody really respects her. The only reason she got into regionals was because her competition was a bunch of 13-year-old girls. Put me in that division. Let's see how she does.,"God, you look like such an idiot. [both yelling] [grunting]"
1179,"Did you hear about the fight? Well, it wasn't much of a fight, actually.",No. Are those purchase orders signed?
1180,No. Are those purchase orders signed?,I opened a big can of whoop-ass on him.
1181,Huh? What?,I went medieval on his heinie.
1182,Are those purchase orders signed?,"Hey, Stanley. I don't tell you how to do your job, do I? He..."
1183,"Hey, Stanley. I don't tell you how to do your job, do I? He...","Look, I just want to have a job, Michael. If we don't get these purchase orders..."
1184,"Grow a pair, Stanley. Right? There not gonna downsize because I miss a lot of deadlines. That's not how business works, okay? [sighs] Okay.","For the record, let me just say, Michael Scott has no honor. If he lived in Japan, he would be an outcast. Well, that's not totally true, 'cause Asians worship chest hair. I had a friend, a hairy friend, who lived in Japan. He told me the women would line up to satisfy his every need. So, and he wasn't even that attractive."
1185,"Well, what about the other stuff that has to be in today?","If you didn't badger me with so many questions, Pam, I could be done with it by now."
1186,"[entering office] Hey, have they left for the big meeting yet?  I've got Michael's lucky tie.",No.  They're in the conference room.
1187,"Wait, are those Michael's Levis?","Yeah, who dry-cleans jeans?"
1188,"Yeah, who dry-cleans jeans?","Michael and his jeans.  He gets in them, and I'm not exactly sure what happens.  But I can tell you, he loves the way he looks in those jeans.  I know that's why he started casual Fridays."
1189,Excuse me?,"Radisson just gives out this vibe, 'Oh, I'm doing business at the Radisson'.  It's kind of snooty.  So."
1190,What?,"She had done a background check on me, she had it printed out."
1191,What is going on?,We are doing worst first dates.
1192,"Wait, when was this?",Umm... it was not that long ago.
1193,Do you always shut down the entire office when you leave for an hour?,"No, no.  That would not be efficient.  Actually, they just don't get very much work done when I'm not here.  [Jan stares at Michael] That's not true.  I know how to delegate, and they do more work done when I'm not here.  Not more.  The same amount of work is done, whether I am here or not. [another Jan stare]  Hey, everybody, listen up.  This is what we're gonna do.  You sit tight, until I return.  Sound good?  Doesn't matter, it's an order.  Follow it blindly, mwahahaha, ok?  Alright, ciao.  [to Oscar] Adios!"
1194,"No, no.  That would not be efficient.  Actually, they just don't get very much work done when I'm not here.  [Jan stares at Michael] That's not true.  I know how to delegate, and they do more work done when I'm not here.  Not more.  The same amount of work is done, whether I am here or not. [another Jan stare]  Hey, everybody, listen up.

1197,"You ever been to Scranton, Jan? Dar de-",If it's a couple blocks away-
1198,Why would we need a signal?,"Well, in case one of us gets into trouble, the other one can signal-"
1199,"What kinda trouble are you planning on getting in, Michael?","Well, I... it could be either of us."
1200,Hello?  Christian?,Yes.
1201,No Gould?,No. [To Christian] Thank you very much for meeting with us.  Have you been waiting long?
1202,No. [To Christian] Thank you very much for meeting with us.  Have you been waiting long?,"No, not long."
1203,"Uh, Jan, what happened?",Michael.
1204,Is Gould dead?  What uh-,"Michael, we got divorced, ok? [to Christian] I'm so sorry.  Excuse me."
1205,"Michael, we got divorced, ok? [to Christian] I'm so sorry.  Excuse me.","Wow, you're kidding me!  Do you wanna talk about?"
1206,"Wow, you're kidding me!  Do you wanna talk about?","Michael. [to hostess] Uh, could we have a table for three, please?"
1207,"Michael. [to hostess] Uh, could we have a table for three, please?",When did this happen?
1208,When did this happen?,We're in a meeting.
1209,What?,"[to Christian] I think we should share an Awesome Blossom, what do you say?   They are awesome. Want to, Christian, blossom?"
1210,"[to Christian] I think we should share an Awesome Blossom, what do you say?   They are awesome. Want to, Christian, blossom?",Sure.
1211,"Ok, it's done. Actually, [turns around] Megan, may we have an Awesome Blossom, please, extra awesome?  Now it's done.",So-
1212,Very very funny joke the other day.  Wanna hear it?,"Christian, you don't have to listen to this."
1213,"[to Michael on speakerphone] Ok, you want me to read 'em?",Yes.
1214,"Oh ho ho, yea!  Bingo! And a lighthouse.  Yes.  That is hysterical.  Could you start that one from the beginning?",Sure.  There's a transcript between a naval ship and a lighthouse.
1215,Is this real? [Pam dumps Michael's screenplay on Jim's desk],It is a screenplay.  Starring himself.
1216,"How long is this? [flips through pages]  Oh, Pam. Good work! Oop, wait, stop.  Drawings.",What is that?
1217,What is that?,"Oh, those are drawings.  In case the writing didn't really put a picture in your head.  And there he is, in the flesh, Agent Michael Scarn.  Now we know what he looks like."
1218,"[to waitress]  Excuse me, could I have a vodka tonic, please?","Do we all have our copy of 'Threat Level: Midnight', by Michael Scott?"
1219,"Do we all have our copy of 'Threat Level: Midnight', by Michael Scott?","Yeah, yeah."
1220,That's the character's name?,Oh yeah-
1221,"Why not, Dwight?  This is a movie.  I mean, this is for all of America to enjoy.",You took something that doesn't belong to you.
1222,The lead role of Agent Michael Scarn?,[making the mouth on his tie talk]  Yum! Yum yum yum! [Christian laughs]  That's delicious!  I love it!
1223,What's the bottom line?,"Bop! Be blah bop, be boo boo bop."
1224,Did somebody say 'baby back ribs'?  Hmmm? Hmmmmm?,I don't think Christian has time for that.
1225,"Ok, what are they?",First message is: 'I love you'.  That's from me.
1226,[looks around conference room] You're joking right?,Michael Scarn takes out a nine-millimeter gun and shoots the-
1227,Michael's movie?  Two thumbs down. [Smiles] Heh.,"A man sitting several seats down, who has a gold face, turns to Michael Scarn. [out of character] Uh... Ooh, Oscar, you wanna play Goldenface?"
1228,"A man sitting several seats down, who has a gold face, turns to Michael Scarn. [out of character] Uh... Ooh, Oscar, you wanna play Goldenface?","Mr. Scarn, perhaps you would be more comfortable in my private jet?"
1229,"Mr. Scarn, perhaps you would be more comfortable in my private jet?","Yes, perhaps I would, Goldenface.  Sam, get my luggage."
1230,"Samuel, you are such an idiot, you are the worst assistant ever.  And you're disgusting, Dwigt. [out of character] Wait, who's Dwigt?","Here's what we think happened.  Michael's sidekick, who all through the movie is this complete idiot who's causing the downfall of the United States, was originally named Dwight.  But then Michael changed it to Samuel L. Chang using a search and replace, but that doesn't work on misspelled words, leaving behind one Dwigt.  And Dwight figured it out.  Oops."
1231,"Ok, you know what? I am done with this.  That's it, the end.","Well, some of us wanna keep reading, so-"
1232,"That's actually a good idea.  We'll all take a brief intermission. [To Pam]  Hey, are you hungry?",Yeah.
1233,Yeah?,"So after watching my mom go through so much pain, I decided to keep that promise, that I made to her, and take care of her."
1234,"Woo, well, this brings us to Jan.  Truth or Dare?  Tell us about your divorce. Ohh, ohh.","Oh no, Michael, Michael, please.  No, really."
1235,"Oh, so you're not gonna play?  She's not playing.",It's not fair.
1236,"No, you were not stupid.  Gould was stupid.  Right?",That's right.
1237,You know?,"You were really brave!  You, you put your arms out there, you slit your wrists."
1238,Right down the street?,"Uh huh, Kenneth Road, born and raised.  Spent my whole life right here in Lackawanna County and I do not intend on movin'.  I know this place.  I know how many hospitals we have, I know how many schools we have.  It's home, you know?  I know the challenges this county's up against.  Here's the thing about those discount suppliers.  They don't care.  They come in, they undercut everything, and they run us out of business, and then, once we're all gone, they jack up the prices."

1245,[waking up on office couch] Michael?  Michael? [goes into Michael's office]  Michael?  [looks out Michael's window] His car's not in the parking lot.  I should check the accident reports. [taxi pulls into Dunder-Mifflin parking lot] Who's this?  Jan?,"Morning, Pam.  Hey."
1246,Did you do her?,Who.
1247,Did you do her?,This is none of your affair because she is your boss-
1248,"And she is a woman.  She is a strong, soft, thoughtful, sexy woman.  And you know what?  I don't think that I can sit here and let you talk about her that way without me defending her honor. [to camera]  Jan, I defend your honor.  [to Dwight]  Is that all?",Jan didn't come back for her car last night.
1249,What!?,Could it be that Agent Michael Scarn has finally found his Catherine Zeta?
1250,Could it be that Agent Michael Scarn has finally found his Catherine Zeta?,"Oh, I don't know... [Jim laughs, phone rings] Oh my God.  This is Jan's cell."
1251,"I know we have to register as a consensual sexual relationship with HR.  My question: do I do it as the man?  Does she do it as my superior?  I don't know.  That leads to other issues that we may have in our relationship.  It's, uh, [phone rings] Excuse me.  Hello?  Hi!  Just talking about you.  The camera?  No.  Uh huh.  How's traffic?  I miss you.  What.  Ok.  Well, if it was a mistake, it was a wonderful mistake.  No. [to camera]  Would you excuse me? [to Jan] No, I did not intentionally get you drunk. Um hmm.  No, no. [goes under his desk] This is just a fight. This is just a first fight of many fights we're gonna have.  Right.  No.  Wha-so-I don't understand, you wanna see other people.  Only other people.  Wh-why, ok, I think you're still a little bit drunk [to camera which is now under desk] Excuse me?  Excuse me?!  [to Jan] I think you're, yes, why don't you just come back here, go to the hotel, have a few drinks and-no, no.  I didn't slip you something!",Some might even say that we had our first date last night.
1252,"Oh, really?",Really.
1253,Why might some say that?,"Cause there was dinner, by candlelight."
1254,"Ok, we didn't dance.  I was totally joking anyway.  I mean, it's not really a date if the girl goes home to her fiance.  Right?",Have you ever heard of Doctor David Friendly?
1255,Have you ever heard of Doctor David Friendly?,Hmm...
1256,"Doctor David Friendly's Egg Yolk Diet.  It's, it's kind of unique.  It's just, my diet the last couple months has consisted mostly of eggs yolks and cottage cheese.  And, um, what you do, you don't just have the egg yolks, it's not like a Rocky thing.  You do like hard boiled eggs and I got one a those melon ballers [shot of Michael peeling boiled egg] and I, it's just like a little ice cream scoop, and I just scoop out the middle of the egg and just pop it in my mouth.  I don't even, I don't even use a plate anymore.  Uh, the first couple weeks I did, but you know what, boom, I keep a melon baller in my desk so if I have a hard boiled egg [Jenna breaks as Pam and laughs] I know, I know!  But you know what?  It's perfect.  I know it sounds ridiculous, it sounds ridiculous, but you know what?  Dr. David Friendly, he came up with this thing.  The guy, I think he was like four hundred pounds when he started, and he started with this... I, well, the melon baller was my idea.",Most of that is good.
1257,"[throwing away food from the fridge] Not today, Kevin.  Cannot be around carbs today.  You know what one loaf of bread would do to my abs?","I'm almost there, so we should have plenty of time to go over the presentation."
1258,What?,I have a conflict with that.
1259,What do you mean?,"Uh, I have a pajama party.  At the Playboy Mansion.  With the bunnies."
1260,Are you hearing me?,"I'm hearing you, meeting confirmed."
1261,"Meeting confirmed.  Would you like your confirmation number?  Please grab a pen, because I will only be repeating this once.",[sighs] I'll see you in ten minutes.
1262,"What is a closer?  A closer is a sales term for someone who always gets the job done.  And that is me.  A B C, always be closing.  Glen Garry, Glen Ross.  'Hey, gimme the Glen Ross leads.'  'No way, they're just for closers.'  'Do you know who you're talking to?' 'I'm Michael Scott.'  'Really?  Well, take any lead you want.'  'No thanks, I don't need 'em.'  Because I have a client list [taps screen] right here in my computer.  [sighs] So suck on that.",Hey.
1263,What are you doing?,"I don't know, I think I was just staring at my desk."
1264,Really?  Do you wanna get back to that?  I could go.  I should go.,"Yeah, do you mind leaving?"
1265,"Yeah, do you mind leaving?","No, not at all."
1266,Do you think they'll get the account. [Stanley stares at her] How come you never answer me?,"I'm sorry, Phyllis.  No, I don't think they'll get the account."
1267,Is that it?,"Yup, I guess so."
1268,Does he die?,I sincerely doubt it.
1269,"What was my worst first date?  Umm.  It was a couple of years ago.  It was a lunch date, actually, it was right down here, at Cugino's.  And we had just met, and we really hit it off, it was, it was kinda nice.  Umm, huh.  And, uh, then, as it turned out, it wasn't even a date, because she was actually in love with someone else.  So, best first date is also my worst first date.  Oddly enough.",[bouncing on an exercise ball] You should get one of these.
1270,Do you even know what this is?  It is a fitness orb and it has completely changed my life.  Forget everything you thought you knew about ab workouts.,Done.
1271,"Ok, you know what, uh, how much is that?",It's only twenty-five bucks.
1272,"Pam, could I see you in my office?","It's performance review day, company-wide.  Last year, my performance review started with Michael asking me what my hopes and dreams were, and it ended with him telling me he could bench-press 190 pounds.  So, I don't really know what to expect."
1273,"And I want you to listen to a voicemail from my boss. [Jan on recording] 'Michael, it's Jan. I guess I missed you.  I'll, uh, be there this afternoon for performance reviews.  I hope it's understood that that will be our only topic of discussion. See you soon.'  First impressions?","Uh, just off the top... I think she'll be here this afternoon."
1274,"[playing Jan's message] 'I guess I missed you.' I guess I missed you.  So, she misses me?",She missed you.
1275,"Ok. Yeah, what, what?",Well I don't think you're gonna be very happy with this.
1276,"Ah, why, that's great news?   That, that, then why would, why would I not like that?","Um, just cause, that, you work together, and it might be awkward."
1277,"Uh, that is so stupid.  What if he gives it to you?",I win.
1278,"Ugh, you know what?  I am going to zone you out for the rest of today.  I need to stay focused, and I don't have to see you tomorrow or Sunday and please don't call me, and we'll see how things go on Monday.  Uh, stupid.","Wait, wait; one thing.  Uh, by tomorrow, you mean Saturday, right?"
1279,"Wait, wait; one thing.  Uh, by tomorrow, you mean Saturday, right?","Uh, duh."
1280,Really?,"Oh, yes.  Let's listen to it again.  And this time, really listen to the pauses."
1281,"God, Stanley, that's frickin' brilliant. How do you know that?  Did you learn that on the streets?  Sorry.","Oh, no, that's ok.  I did learn it on the streets.  On the ghetto, in fact."
1282,Michael?,Yeah?
1283,Yeah?,Jan's on the phone for you.
1284,Interesting.  Jan is calling me.  Maybe it wasn't so mutual after all. [puts Jan on speakerphone] Yeah?,Michael.
1285,Jan!  To what do I owe this pleasure?,I am returning your many calls.
1286,...in your office?,"They are not.  Yes, they are. [Jan hangs up]  That's my girlfriend."
1287,Romances?,"Pam, I have ideas on a daily basis. I know I do.  I have a clear memory of telling people my ideas.  Um, is there any chance you wrote any of my ideas down?  In a folder?  A 'Michael-idea' folder?"
1288,"Pam, I have ideas on a daily basis. I know I do.  I have a clear memory of telling people my ideas.  Um, is there any chance you wrote any of my ideas down?  In a folder?  A 'Michael-idea' folder?",Sorry.
1289,That's unfortunate.  How 'bout the suggestion box?  There's tons of ideas in there.,What suggestion box?
1290,What suggestion box?,"The suggestion box that I put out, and people could be put in suggestions anonymously?  Maybe there's prizes?"
1291,"The suggestion box that I put out, and people could be put in suggestions anonymously?  Maybe there's prizes?","Oh, yeah. Uh, I think I remember that from back from when I first started."
1292,"Why don't you find it and tell people to get theirs... never mind, I'll tell them.  Hello, everybody?  Yeah, uh, attention, please.  Jan Levinson's coming, very soon, and so, we're going to have our weekly suggestion box meeting, so you can all get your constructive compliments in a.s.a.p.",Don't you mean constructive criticism?
1293,Don't you mean constructive criticism?,What did I say?
1294,What did I say?,You said 'constructive complements'; that doesn't make any sense.
1295,"Well, Kelly, that was neither constructive nor a compliment, so maybe you should stop criticizing my English and start making some suggestions. 'K?","[on phone] Hey, Dan, this is Jim, and it is about 11:15, and I wanted to know what you were up to tomorrow, which is the fifteenth, and that is a..."
1296,"[on phone]  We'll address this in the meeting then. Ok. Ok, bye-bye. [to Pam]  Could you please tell Michael that I'm here?",Sure.
1297,"Hi, Jan.  How are you?",I'm good; how are you?
1298,I'm good; how are you?,Good to see you.

1300,Can we please go in your office?,"Yep, right after you.  Apres-vous. [mouths to Pam] No calls."
1301,Really?,Not like that.
1302,"I'm a little confused.  'Cause first it's all like kissy-kissy.  And then it's like all regret.  Because 'Oh, I regret that.'  But, 'Wait, I'm still gonna call you.'  But, but, 'We're just gonna talk business.  And I may come down and fire you if you don't do your job.'  But what were talking about when we first kissed?  Business.",So are you still in the middle of the performance reviews then?
1303,So are you still in the middle of the performance reviews then?,"No, no, no, I finished all of that.  I'm very fast.  I'm not too fast.  Not like wham-bam-thank ya ma'am.  But I do say thank ya ma'am.  But, I'm, I'm not like wham-bam.  Not that there's anything wrong with wham-bam.  If it's consensual.  [cold Jan stare]  We're talking about office stuff.  Can I ask you a question?"
1304,"No, no, no, I finished all of that.  I'm very fast.  I'm not too fast.  Not like wham-bam-thank ya ma'am.  But I do say thank ya ma'am.  But, I'm, I'm not like wham-bam.

1305,Are you wearing a new perfume today?,How is that a business question?
1306,How is that a business question?,"Well, you're wearing it at the office. And [smells Jan] it, I'm sorry, but no offense, but it's really sexy."
1307,"Hey, how's it goin'?","Oh my God, did you see 'The Apprentice' last night?"
1308,"Oh my God, did you see 'The Apprentice' last night?","Course, it's on every Thursday night, so how could I miss it?"
1309,"Course, it's on every Thursday night, so how could I miss it?",Can you believe who Trump fired?
1310,Can you believe who Trump fired?,"No, that was unbelievable."
1311,Who?  Who was it?  Who did he fire?,You didn't see it?
1312,You didn't see it?,"No, I went out and got drunk with my laser tag team last night.  Crap!  I never go out on a Thursday night; what the hell was I thinking?"
1313,"No, I went out and got drunk with my laser tag team last night.  Crap!  I never go out on a Thursday night; what the hell was I thinking?","I don't understand- [phone rings] Hold on.  Sorry. [answers]  Yes, Pam."
1314,"Uh, I'd like to sit in on that meeting [to Pam] is it happening right now?","No, it's in like ten minutes."
1315,"Why are we here?  Because I value your opinions.  Now, I know a lot of don't think that I read your suggestions, but I do.  I just sift through them every week and I really look and scrutinize to see what you guys are writing.  Um, so, let's, uh, just read some of these suckers.  Alright.  Number one: 'What should we do to prepare for Y2K?'",What should we do to prepare for Y2K?
1316,What should we do to prepare for Y2K?,I thought you read these every week.
1317,"Oh, ok, well, yeah, who wrote it?",Tom?
1318,Tom?,Tom.  Then it is a joke because there is nobody in here named Tom.
1319,Tom?  He worked in accounting up until about a year ago. [blank stares] Tom? [acts like she's shooting herself in the head] Pow.,"Oh, that guy?  That guy was weird.  Alright, next suggestion."
1320,"Oh, that guy?  That guy was weird.  Alright, next suggestion.",Next suggestion.
1321,Aren't the suggestions meant for you?,"Well, Toby, if by me you are inferring that I have B.O., then I would say that is a very poor choice of words."
1322,"Was I, Creed?!  Ok, well, you know what? I am implying is that when we're on an elevator together, I should maybe take the stairs, because talk about stank.  Not that I would ever say something like that in public, and I never have, and I never will. I just think it's something that we should all be aware of.  Ok?  Now that we've learned this, let's continue.  See, this is good, we're learning and we're figuring some stuff out.  'You need to do something about your coffee breath'-",You need-
1323,"Yeah, is that hard for you?  Alright, well-","Well, when you have coffee breath-"
1324,"Let's keep going.  Keep it going.  Yep.  What do we have here?  We have somebody's piece of gum.  Somebody put a piece of gum in there.  This is not a, a garbage can, this is the future of our company.  This is not a place for gum.  I don't wanna have to read these tomorrow.","Yeah, who wants to come in on a Saturday?"

1326,"Yeah, what? Uh, alright, next suggestion.",Next suggestion.
1327,Don't sleep with your boss'? Do you think this is referring to you boning Jan?,"I can't, I can't-"
1328,Where did you get your outfit?,[loud metal music playing in a stairwell; Dwight pacing] You are giving me this raise!  I deserve this raise! [plays air guitar] Yes! [kicks] Yes! Yes! Hiya!

I am awesome!,I just don't understand why you have to pretend like nothing happened.
1330,Michael?,Oh my God...
1331,"I'm sorry, am I interrupting?  Oh God; were you guys making out?","No, Dwight; come in."
1332,What do you want Dwight?,I am ready for my performance review.
1333,"Is this how you've been conducting all the reviews, Michael?","You wanna talk now, good; OK, Dwight, leave."
1334,"Uh, wait, I would like to discuss my raise?",Why on earth would we give you a raise?
1335,Why on earth would we give you a raise?,"That is an excellent question. Thank you for asking.  Let me bring up one word: dedication. [points to graphs] I have never been late.  Also, I have never missed a day due to illness. [Michael sighs] Even when I had walking pneumonia.  I even come in on holidays."
1336,You do?  How do you get in?,I have a copy of your key.
1337,"Ok, third wheel, why don't you do that?","For instance, the time I brought in deer jerky for the whole office."
1338,"That was deer!? Gross, oh!",You liked it!
1339,"Jan, have you ever had deer?",No.
1340,"It's a delicacy.  And you know what?  It's an aphrodisiac.  So when we're done here, you guys could go over to The Antler Lodge, sample some deer and talk about my raise.","What do you say, Jan?"
1341,"What do you say, Jan?","Ok! Here's what I'm gonna do: I'm gonna step outside, collect my thoughts, and I will return in about ten minutes."
1342,"Look, I know it's your job, I know you have to ask, but I promise you, I'm not gonna discuss it with him, I'm certainly not gonna discuss it with you.  [digs a cigarette out of her purse] Do you have a light?","And in conclusion, I think that Lex Luthor said it best when he said 'Dad, you have no idea what I'm capable of'."
1343,That's from Superman?,"Smallville.  And that is why, I feel, that I deserve this raise."
1344,How do you come back from that?,"Um, you don't, I don't think, come all the way back, you know.  Especially working together."
1345,"No, I mean doing that with Michael. How do you come back from that?",Oh-
1346,K?,"Wait, wait, wait, come, I just, I just wanna know why?"
1347,"Wait, wait, wait, come, I just, I just wanna know why?","Michael, now is not the time or the place."
1348,"Ok, so you're saying that there is a different time or place?","No, I am saying we are never having this conversation."
1349,"Well, ok, well never as in 'never ever ever', or never as in there's still a chance?","Never, for me, always means 'never ever ever.'"
1350,"I just want to know, from the horse's mouth, what is the dealio?","Michael, it has nothing-"
1351,Am I too short?,"With your looks, ok?  It's your personality.  I mean, you're obnoxious, and rude, and, and, and stupid, and you do have coffee breath, by the way, and, and I don't agree about the b.o., but you are very, very inconsiderate."
1352,"With your looks, ok?  It's your personality.  I mean, you're obnoxious, and rude, and, and, and stupid, and you do have coffee breath, by the way, and, and I don't agree about the b.o., but you are very, very inconsiderate.",Really?
1353,Really?,"Really.  You're, you're, you're a great guy, ok?"
1354,"Really.  You're, you're, you're a great guy, ok?","I appreciate that, thank you."
1355,"At this time in my life.  I just am not in the place right now where I'm looking for a relationship, so we can still work together, we can still be friends but... ok?",So my looks have nothing to do with it?
1356,So my looks have nothing to do with it?,"Ohhh, God."
1357,"Hey, it's 12:20; where the hell's Dwight?",Ummm... no idea.
1358,You know what this is?,Yes.
1359,Then why the question?,"This is a visual aid for my performance review. Budget is tight, and if anyone is getting a raise, it is gonna be a fight to the death. And I intend on winning that fight. 'Dwight: determined, worker, intense, good worker, hard worker, terrific. Dwight.'"
1360,Really?,Yeah.
1361,You have a better idea?,"Yeah, magnificent worker, marvelous worker, more money for this worker. Man, I like this worker. Mighty worker.  That's good. That's good."
1362,Do we understand each other?,Absolutely.
1363,"I am not going to discuss anything outside of Dunder Mifflin business, period.' Okay. Now, why would Jan say she only wants to talk business and then make it clear that she is on her period? God, I don't understand women. How about a clear signal, right? Is that too much to ask?","So, that's... It's great."
1364,Yeah. You have fun?,"Yes, I did."
1365,Did you go to first base?,"Hell, yeah."
1366,"Oh, yeah?",Yeah.
1367,Did you go to second?,What?
1368,What?,Second.
1369,"Okay, so close call at second. Was there an infield fly?","Um, yup, wait, yes."
1370,Pop-up?,"No, there... Later there was."
1371,Really?,Yes.
1372,"So, you got the signal from the third-base coach. You know what I'm saying? Like if there was a fly out to deep right, you know. A runner on second. He tagged up, didn't he?","I didn't, you know, it was... It was dark, for one thing."
1373,"Let's just push on, shall we?",Pushing on.
1374,"It's next. Just keep it. 'Look on the supply shelf.' What? What is that? All right, Ryan, look on the supply shelf, would you?",Yeah. It's another note.
1375,Does it specify which windshield?,I'll check them all.
1376,Which one?,"Oh, no, no. It's on the Miata."
1377,What does it say?,He can't hear you?
1378,He can't hear you?,"Okay, field trip's over. Come on. Could we please get back to this?"
1379,"Okay, field trip's over. Come on. Could we please get back to this?",[clapping] Come on. Let's get back to this.
1380,"All right, don't break any lands-speed records getting back, okay, Stanley?",I'm back.
1381,Don't sleep with your boss.' Do you think this is referring to you boning Jan?,"Okay, let me make something clear. As embarrassing as this is, I feel that it needs to be said. There is nothing romantic or sexual going on with Michael and myself."
1382,"The other night, I gave him a polite congratulatory kiss because he just closed the biggest deal of his career. And that's it. If anything else has been implied, Dwight, or inferred, Michael, Creed, it's just not true, okay? It's not true. So... Is everyone straight on that?",Crystal.
1383,"What? Yes, that is exactly what I mean. Wow. You are very good at what you do.",Thank you.
1384,Getting a little something that calm the nerves?,What nerves?
1385,What nerves?,"For the performance review. Oh, wait, you don't get one. You're a temp."
1386,Why would I lie about a performance review?,Why would Michael give you one before me?
1387,Why would Michael give you one before me?,I think because my name is before yours in alphabetical order. [coins dropping]
1388,How did it go?,"Fine. He actually gave me a small raise, which I did not ask for. [hits vending machine] It's stuck. [Dwight begins throwing his entire body into the vending machine] It's cool, it fell."
1389,"[Wild Side playing] You are gonna give me this raise. Ya! Yes, you are. You are gonna give me this raise. Ya! Ya! The least you can do is keep my salary consistent with inflation, right? You are gonna give me this raise! Why? Because I'm awesome, awesome, yes! Yes! Yes! Thank you for your time, dude. Champ. My lord, mi amigo. Mi amor. Ha! Wild side! I am ready. [groans]","Yeah, that got a little out of control. Jan's taking a break, which is fine. I'm doing the same, just chilling. Getting my mind off of us. She's right. I need to be more professional at the office. When I'm at work, I need to focus on work. I should call her ex-husband."
1390,"Hello, is this R. Gould? Hi there. My name is Michael Scott, I work at Dunder Mifflin. I believe I work with your wife, ex-wife, Jan. Yeah, that's right, yes. Um... I was wondering if I could ask a personal question about her. Mmm-hmm. Okay, well, could I ask anyway? Uh-huh. Well, I'm just gonna ask. When you guys were dating was she sort of easy to get and then really hard to get?","Yeah, that Gould is a real interesting guy, a gem. I can see why he and Jan are no longer together. If my conversation with him is any measure of their relationship, he was verbally abusive, he was curt. He was... He had an inability to communicate, shall I say? He was emotionally unavailable. I don't know how she dealt with that as long as she did."
1391,"Yeah, that Gould is a real interesting guy, a gem. I can see why he and Jan are no longer together. If my conversation with him is any measure of their relationship, he was verbally abusive, he was curt. He was... He had an inability to communicate, shall I say? He was emotionally unavailable. I don't know how she dealt with that as long as she did.",Never...
1392,What?,"Nothing, I just..."
1393,"What did you say, Michael?",Nothing.
1394,Did you call my ex?,"No, I did not."
1395,"How dare you, Michael? My personal life is off-limits to you.",I...
1396,"Okay, how dare you do that?",I didn't do that. I... Maybe he called me.
1397,"Why would he do that? Why would he call you, Michael? Why would my husband call you?","Ex-husband, you have to let it go."
1398,"What is an office? Is it a group of people? Maybe. Is it an idea? Of course, yes. Is it a living organism? Exactly, yes. And any single cell organism has to have a spine, and that's me. But the spine is always controlled by a brain, and that is Jan. But the brain needs a heart, and that is me again. So ironic. You know what? The heart is smarter than the brain. But the brain is so effing hot.","It is Friday morning and it is another beautiful day in Scranton, Pennsylvania.  [sees man in a turban outside] Oh my God. Ohhh. [dials phone number] Pick up, pick up, pick up, pick up.  Oh, we have a serious problem here. [goes out onto office floor] Alright everybody, lock the doors, turn off the lights.  Pretend you're not here."
1399,Are we in danger?,"There's no time to think about if this is real.  Just, shh, everybody. [knock at the front door]"
1400,"Michael, should I call the... [Michael waves his hands] What?",The IT tech guy and me did not get off to a great start.

1516,Should we just keep opening up the presents?,We don't do anything until Michael gives us further instructions.

1519,And I have to give it to her? I don't have a choice?,"Yes, now you can steal the oven mitt, the old shirt or the shower radio or pick a new gift."
1520,Who wants to take paintball lessons? How is that better than an iPod?,I never said it was better than an iPod.

1555,Really?,I invited someone to the party. Bob Vance. He works at Vance Refrigeration next door. That's how we met. [whispers] He's my boyfriend.
1556,"What separates humans from jungle beasts? The fact that we have rules. When humans give each other gifts, they do it properly and orderly.

I'm going to combine elements of fun and motivation and education into a single mind-blowing experience.,It is now time to unveil the destination of this year's retreat. We are going on a harbor cruise of Lake Wallenpaupack. It's a booze cruise!
1581,I have a test for business school tomorrow night. Is it okay if I skip the cruise and study for that?,"No. This is mandatory. But don't worry, you know what? You're gonna learn plenty. This is gonna turn your life around, Ryan."
1582,"No. This is mandatory. But don't worry, you know what? You're gonna learn plenty. This is gonna turn your life around, Ryan.",I'm already in business school.
1583,"Wait, Michael?",Yeah?
1584,Yeah?,Why did you tell us to bring a bathing suit?
1585,Why did you tell us to bring a bathing suit?,To throw you off the scent.
1586,"Well, that's not my fault, okay? Just.. we're not going to pay for a bathing suit. Okay, I know what you're all thinking, 'Who is this smart little cookie?' Her name is Brenda... something, and she is from corporate. And she is here, like you, to learn from what I have to say.","I am a great motivational speaker. I attended a Tony Robbins event by the airport last year, and... it wasn't the actual course. You have to pay for the actual course. But it talked about the actual course. And I've incorporated a lot of his ideas into my own course."
1587,"Now, on this ship that is the office, what is a sales department? Anyone?",How about the sales department is the sails?
1588,How about the sales department is the sails?,"Yes, Darryl, the sales department makes sales. Good. Let me just explain. I see the sales department as the furnace."
1589,A furnace?,"Yeesh, how old is this ship?"
1590,"Yeesh, how old is this ship?",How about the anchor?
1591,How about the anchor?,What does the furnace do?
1592,What does the furnace do?,"All right, let's not get hung up on the furnace. This just... it's the sales... I see the sales department down there. They're in the engine room, and they are shoveling coal into the furnace, right? I mean, who saw the movie Titanic? They were very important in the movie Titanic. Who saw it? Show of hands!"
1593,"All right, let's not get hung up on the furnace. This just... it's the sales... I see the sales department down there. They're in the engine room, and they are shoveling coal into the furnace, right? I mean, who saw the movie Titanic? They were very important in the movie Titanic. Who saw it? Show of hands!",I'm not really sure what movie you're talking about. Are you sure you got the title right?
1594,I'm not really sure what movie you're talking about. Are you sure you got the title right?,Titanic?
1595,Titanic?,I think you're thinking of The Hunt for Red October.
1596,What?,"The... no, no. No, I didn't... okay. Well, okay, in a nutshell, what I'm saying is... leadership. We'll talk more about that on the boat. Ship."
1597,"In an office, when you are ranking people, manager is higher than captain. On a boat, who knows? It's nebulose.","Hey, look! I'm king of the world!"
1598,"Well, we might, okay? Please let me finish, okay? Thank you. So, the Coast Guard requires that I tell you where the safety exits are. On this ship, it's very easy. Anywhere over the side. [Dwight laughs loudly.] Not only am I your ship captain, I am also your party captain! Whoo! We're gonna get it going in just a few minutes here...",I'm your party captain too! And you are gonna put on your dancing shoes later on! So we are gonna...

1600,"Your company's employees are not the only people on the boat tonight, okay?",We're all gonna have a good time tonight!

1610,"Hey, I got an idea! How would you like to steer the ship, Dwight?",Keep us on a steady course. Keep a sharp eye out. I'm counting on you!

1613,"Whoo! Who's next? Come on, Pam! Come on! Come on!","No, I'm not going to do that."
1614,"Hey, why don't we find like a quieter place to hang out?",I've just gotta wait for Darryl to do his shot. Just a minute. Come on! [chanting] Darryl! Darryl!
1615,"I mean, I don't know. So... what's it like dating a cheerleader?","Oh, um... [A long silence.]"
1616,"So, what's this presentation all about?","Ah! See, this is of general interest. It is about priorities and making decisions, using the boat as an analogy. What is important to you? If the boat is sinking, what do you save?"
1617,"Ah! See, this is of general interest. It is about priorities and making decisions, using the boat as an analogy. What is important to you? If the boat is sinking, what do you save?",Women and children.
1618,I'd like to be engaged. How did you manage to pull that off?,"Uh, I've been engaged for three years, and there's no end in sight. So... you don't wanna ask my advice."
1619,"Suppose your office building's on fire. Jim, who would you save?","Um... let's see, uh...  The customer. Because the customer is king."
1620,"When you were in the Navy, did you ever almost die?","Oh yeah, oh yeah. And I wasn't thinking about some customer. I was thinking about my first wife. The day I got back on shore, I married her."
1621,You know what? I would save the receptionist. I just wanted to clear that up.,"Hello, everybody, could I have your attention for just a second? Could you listen to me for a second?

1624,Do you think that'll ever be us?,No.
1625,What is wrong with you? Why did you even bring me here tonight?,I don't know. Let's break up.
1626,Whoa. What?,This is where Captain Jack drives the boat.

1628,Really? What?,"Vomicillin. Okay. All right. It's time to be boss. It's time to motivate. Let's blow some minds here. Okay, guys, guys, cool it.

1631,"I'm in the brig. See? The boat's not as corporate-friendly as advertised. What was the deal with the guy jumping overboard? What was... if he had just waited and heard what I had to say, he would be motivated right now and not all wet.",Is somebody there?
1632,Is somebody there?,What happened to you?
1633,What happened to you?,Captain Jack has a problem with authority.
1634,"Oh, right, because you announced that his ship was sinking?","He just totally lost it. If you ask me, he caused the panic."

1670,"Ok, could someone come and get me please, Ryan?","Michael, you should stay home and rest."
1671,There's no toilet paper here.  Could Ryan... tell Ryan to bring toilet paper.  Could you tell 'em that?,Can you hop?
1672,Can you hop?,"I tried hopping, Kevin, and I bumped my elbow against the wall and now my elbow has a protruberance."

1674,"[silence, Dwight enters the office] What is going on? What is going on?","Michael, is, um, sick and he wants one of us to rescue him."

1679,Is he ok?,"He's still driving... Dwight, you forgot your bumper!"
1680,Hellooo? ... Please don't send Dwight!,"Morning everyone.  Don't freak out. I forbid anybody to freak out.  Clearly, I have had a very serious accident, but I will recover, God willing.  I just want to be treated normally today.  Normal would actually be good, considering the trauma that I've been through."
1681,Did you explain why?,"No, I didn't mention that you cooked your foot."

1723,"This morning?  Just like every other morning, just climbed on in. [Everyone laughs]","Hey, hey, hey, not funny! Not funny."

1738,Why?,It's just hard to explain.
1739,You don't think you should sit in the back with Dwight?,The rules of shotgun are very simple and very clear.  The first person to shout 'shotgun' when you're within the sight of the car gets the front seat.  That's how  the game's played.  There are no exceptions for someone with a concussion.

1750,"Look since you have the machine up and running, can I just stick my foot, we take a look?","Well, for a burn, you really just need to look at the outside of the foot."
1751,"Ok, what kinda machine is that?",Does the skin look red and swollen?
1752,Does the skin look red and swollen?,That's what she said.
1753,"Oh my God, what is going on, is Dwight ok?","Uh hmm, he should be fine, but, uh, they brought him in for a CAT scan."

1755,"Hey, Oscar?","What's up, Pam?"
1756,"What's up, Pam?","I just wanted to let you that Dwight's gonna be ok.  The doctor said there's a really simple treatment for a concussion, so he'll probably even be back at work tomorrow."

1971,"[voicemail message for Jim] Hey, guess what?  I moved my computer so I can't see Michael's head.  It's working.  I think I can have a career as a very specific type of decorator.","[voicemail message for Jim]  Sudoku. Level moderate. 18 minutes. Suck on that, Halpert."
1972,"[voicemail message for Jim] Hey, what's that word we made up when you have a thing stuck in your shoe?  Anyway, I have a thing stuck in my shoe.","[voicemail message for Jim] Hey, I have a chance to sneak out of here early, and I'm not messing this up, so I'll see you tomorrow."
1973,"That looks, cool, where is that?",What?
1974,What?,"That hotel, it looks so romantic."

1986,"You call that a sales call? My God, what have they been teaching you?","You're the one who trained me, Michael."
1987,"Yeah, well, did I teach you to roll over like a submissive dog?",You most certainly did not.
1988,What can I do better?,"Exactly, ask me, which you did, so, tell a joke."
1989,Do you know a joke?,My cousin Mose told me a joke.
1990,"[on the phone] Howard, hello. Dwight Schrute. Dunder Mifflin. Yes, and you are my favorite client. Listen, I'm calling you to tell you a little joke. What is black and white and red and can't think? A nun who has a beet for a head. ... No, I'm Catholic, too.",Give me the phone.
1991,"[on the phone] Uh-huh? Yeah. Well, you know, like in a fast food restaurant, just to be nice they hire somebody who can't even find their way to work? That is Dwight.",[whispering] He's my best customer.
1992,"[on the phone] What can we do to help you out? You know what? I have a discount. Today and today only, on lightweight copier paper.","But that's my sale. This is my sale, Michael!"
1993,You ready?,Mmm-hmm. [thumping] [Roy groaning] Now you've got to drink.
1994,"Okay, look, I know what you're gonna say. That I'm not standing up for myself. But you know what? It's complicated and I really don't appreciate all the badgering.",You could out-sell Michael any day.
1995,"[knocks] Hey, what's going on?",Michael... I thought we agreed you wouldn't be here.
1996,What are you doing?,"Hold... Just hear me out. What is more important than Quality? E-Quality. Now studies show that today's woman, the Ally McBeal woman, as I call her, is at a crossroads..."

2000,"Yes, Pam?",Michael's still at the door.
2001,[in the background] So one obstacle is how assertiveness is perceived differently in men and women. Men who are assertive will be admired. They're called... anyone?,It's a terrible idea.
2002,What is?,Them in there all together. If they stay in there too long they're going to get on the same cycle. Wreak havoc on our plumbing.
2003,Let's just clap. Ready? [clapping] Yeah! Yeah!,Yeah!
2004,Why can't boys play with dolls? Why does society force us to use urinals when sitting down is far more comfortable?,"Can you please do this somewhere else, Michael?"
2005,"Can you please do this somewhere else, Michael?",We have nowhere else Jan. This...
2006,"OK, OK, Fine. Yeah, actually, perfect. Perfect. You know what? There's another side to this place, gentleman. And I know we all love our cushy jobs and our fun, exciting office. But do you realize that underneath us, there's another world. The warehouse world. A world that is teeming with sweat and dirt and life. Life. The bowels of the office. These guys are down there, they are real men doing real man's work. We are going to learn how a warehouse works.","Oh, I think it's going to work out great. Because managing the warehouse is a very important part of my job. And I haven't been there in months."
2007,Remember on Lost when they met the Others?,"I'm so sorry about that... um... so where were we? Pam, are you okay taking notes then?"
2008,"I'm so sorry about that... um... so where were we? Pam, are you okay taking notes then?",Mmmhmm.
2009,Please? Thank you. very much.,"So let's meet the warehouse! Let's get some shots. Pan around there. This is Darryl, one of our warehouse staff. Darryl, what is your biggest fear?"
2010,"So let's meet the warehouse! Let's get some shots. Pan around there. This is Darryl, one of our warehouse staff. Darryl, what is your biggest fear?",My biggest fear is that someone will distract us from getting all the shipments out on time.
2011,Why?,Brangelina is the Brad Pitt and Angelina... Roy...
2012,[points at math equasion on chalkboard] Uhhuhhuh. Just in case there's someone down here who shouldn't be. A little 'Good Will Hunting' situation. All right. Troops. This is an important day. Big day. Now you may look around and see two groups here. White collar. Blue collar. But I don't see it that way. And you know why not? Because I am collar-blind.,Why don't we go around the table and all say something that we know we're good at. I will start. I am good at public speaking.
2013,Great. Phyllis?,"I'm good at computer stuff, emails, spreadsheets, all that."
2014,[disbelieving] Really?,I don't know. I thought that I wasn't going to be asked that...
2015,Really? I thought they were pretty...,I don't know how I fit in with these women. Here. Or with Jan. Um... I mean we get along great. Fine. Um... I guess the person I have the most in common with is...
2016,"No, it's cool, because I know you're a good guy. And I know that that crush ended a long time ago, so... you know. We're cool, right?",Yeah. Nope. Yeah. Definitely.
2017,"So, we're cool, right?",Yes. Yeah.
2018,"Oh... well... okay... yeah, you know what? I don't think... You.. You're... My job sucks compared to this. I don't think you'd like it up there.",The experience...
2019,Guys! Want to start unloading the truck?,Okay. Let's go. Step up.
2020,Great! Uh-huh?,I want an SUV... with three rows of seats.

2022,"Hey, do you want me to go?","No, why? Why would I... ? You could..."
2023,"No, why? Why would I... ? You could...",I'll go.
2024,"Great, great. And Pam, what about you? What is your dream?","Well... I always dreamed of a house with a terrace upstairs. Plant flowers on it... stuff like that. Since I was a girl. Um... More seriously though, a husband that I love... Roy. And I love to draw. And I... I did a little in college and I'd still love to do something where I could work with art or graphic design in some way."
2025,"Let's start with the Warehouse. What bothers you as guys, you know?",My priority is safety.
2026,"You know that's a good question, Hasselhoff. What bugs us?",OK. Alright. Good. Guys ragging on each other. That's what guys do... and we love it.
2027,I hate it when girls insist on taking them out to new restaurants every weekend night and then they're like 'When are we going to go on a date-date?',I hate that too! [general clapping and agreement]
2028,"Yeah, on our salaries, man, what do they expect? You know to take us out every weekend? You know what I mean? We're not millionaires.",I feel you.
2029,"No, you don't. You don't feel us. How can you? You know what?",Not literally.
2030,I know. God! What is that?,Exactly.
2031,You know what? Is that necessary? Because you already sorta have a union... of guys.,"It's more than necessary, Mike. We need this. Roy? You still have that card from the Dockworker's Union?"
2032,"It's more than necessary, Mike. We need this. Roy? You still have that card from the Dockworker's Union?",In my truck.
2033,Dockworker's?,"Man, hook you up."
2034,Yeah. You know what? I think the problem is the chicks.,"Union! Union, yeah."
2035,Are you with us Mike?,Yeah-es.
2036,"[knocks] This is important. Ladies, take a breather. Jan, I uh wanna... Can I help you? Um... I wanted to say that the guys downstairs are thinking about forming a union. And they have some good points...",What? A union! What...
2037,What? A union! What...,Don't get hysterical.
2038,Let's... be... rational... here. What are the pros? What are the cons?,"The cons are that everyone will lose their job. Michael. Everyone. Office, Warehouse. What do you think... the... pros... are... here?"
2039,"The cons are that everyone will lose their job. Michael. Everyone. Office, Warehouse. What do you think... the... pros... are... here?",Don't talk to me that way please. Just... they're going to want to hear this from you.
2040,What about second base? Like if Michael said that he got to second base with you? Does that mean you like closed a deal?,Excuse me?
2041,Excuse me?,"I mean that's a baseball term, right?"
2042,"I mean that's a baseball term, right?",I don't know what Michael was talking about. I don't know.
2043,How's it going down there?,"It's a complete... well, actually it's exactly what you'd expect, so... How are the girls?"
2044,"It's a complete... well, actually it's exactly what you'd expect, so... How are the girls?",Good. We watched a video about our changing bodies.
2045,Did you really?,No. [laughs]
2046,"Um... but hey? Something kind of cool. There's this internship in graphic design that Jan was telling us about. She made it sound, like, really great.","Nice. Well, what's it all about?"
2047,"Nice. Well, what's it all about?",Um...

2052,Did you take care of the situation?,"Yuh, yuh, yes! I... I have essentially..."
2053,How did you know?,Why not?
2054,Why not?,Just like no big reason. Just a bunch of little reasons.
2055,What? You have something you want to say?,"You got to take a chance on something sometime, Pam. I mean, do you want to be a receptionist here, always?"
2056,"You got to take a chance on something sometime, Pam. I mean, do you want to be a receptionist here, always?","Oh, excuse me! I'm fine with my choices!"
2057,You are?,Yeah.
2058,Pizza. Great equalizer. Rich people love pizza.  Poor people love pizza.  White people love pizza.  Black people love pizza.  Do black people like pizza?,"Hey. Um... look guys, I'm sorry. Sometimes Jan can be such a bitch."
2059,Is it good to be back. Yeah. I mean I love the guy stuff but to run an office you need men and women. You know why? Because you need to have that crazy sexual tension to keep things interesting.,"Dunder Mifflin. This is Pam. Uh... hold, please."
2060,You did?,"And now, I realize that you can program or download any ring you want. So, I'm a little overwhelmed."
2061,Which one of these is coolest? What do you think? [classical piano playing] [violin playing],How about that one?
2062,How about that one?,"No, no. [blues piano playing]"
2063,"Dude, are you kidding me? No. That one says, 'I am so lame.' Know which one I want? There's one that sounds like a jackhammer. Just really grabs your attention. It's like... [imitating jackhammer] You know what I'm talking about?",Do you mean vibrate?

2066,What are you guys talking about?,[at the same time] Guns.
2067,How's that union stuff coming?,Working on it.
2068,"There was this film that I saw when I was little. It was about a kid who goes on the most incredible adventure. And even though it was really great, and she had a great time, she ends up back home in Kansas and says, 'There's no place like home.' And that's how I feel right now. There is no place like home. What the hell was that movie called? [sighs] It's gonna drive me crazy.","I really like Valentine's Day in this office. It's kinda like grade school. Everybody gives out little presents and stuff. Like last year, Jim gave me this card, with Dwight's head on it, it was horrifying and funny and..."
2069,Would you sign here? [Phyllis gets up from desk and walks over.],"Roy and I are saving for the wedding, so I made him promise not to get me anything too big."
2070,Isn't he sweet?,Yeah. Wow.
2071,Question. Will you be seeing Jan when you're in New York?,"I probably will, why do you ask?"
2072,"I probably will, why do you ask?","Well... It's Valentine's Day, and you guys, you know..."
2073,"Hey, Pam. You heart N.Y., right? You want me to pick you up anything?",That's OK.
2074,"Dude, I'm gonna nail it. Me in New York? Oh, I own that city. Fuggedaboudit! See ya!","Well here we go. On our way to New York. New York, New York. City so nice they named it twice. Manhattan is the other name."
2075,What's this? What is this?,"I dunno, it's on"
2076,"Yeah, but who put it here? And for what purpose?",It was there when I sat down.
2077,Hey Kelly. What's up?,"Nothing. Oh except, oh my God Jim. Last night, Ryan and I totally, finally hooked up. It was awesome."
2078,"And it was so funny 'cause we were at this bar with his friends and I was sitting next to him the whole night and he wasn't making a move, so in my head I was like 'Ryan, what's taking you so long?' And then he kissed me. And I didn't know what to say.",Wow.
2079,"So I said, 'Ryan, what took you so long?' And I just said that to him, can you believe that?",Wow.
2080,"Oh my God, Jim, is that embarrassing? I'm embarrassed.","No, don't be."
2081,Guess what?,"Really, Oh, they're from Bob again."
2082,"This is the world famous Rockefeller Center. Founded, of course by Theodore Rockefeller. This is a skating rink and I think the Rangers practice there sometimes and it's, that's Tina Fey [points]. That's Tina Fey from Saturday Night Live. Hello? Hello, hi? [walks over] OH, I'm sorry, I thought you were [Conan O'Brien walks in front of Michael], OK, I thought that was. She, she looked a lot like Tina Fey.

2083,"Really? I wouldn't know anything about that, but I'm glad you enjoyed it.",Oh I did. I did.
2084,"Really? Well, I hope I do.","I would love to live in New York someday. It's a big dream of mine. Work for corporate, with Jan. It'd be awesome. Go to Broadway shows, eat hot dogs. Scranton is great, but New York, is like Scranton on acid, no on speed, no on steroids. [Michael sees it's the end of a street.] OK, umm, I think, that's either the Hudson or the East, so we're back,  should be back this way. There's a lotta pressure on me right now. It's like Michael Jordan, in the NBA finals. Or, like Stormin' Norman Schwarzkopf, and this presentation is desert storm and as soon as it's over, we will not have to deal with those Iraqis anymore. Let's do it."
2085,There they are. What's up? Hey hey.,Hey.
2086,"Yeah, how ya doing? Nobody needs to introduce this guy. Craiggers. [bump fists]",What's up buddy?
2087,What's up buddy?,"You have been kicked out of every strip club in Albany, is that true?"

2091,Tightly wound?,(smirking) Exactly.
2092,"You mean, like a ham?","No, not like a ham. It's about doing something, so that the person knows that you really care about her."
2093,"What about you, Craig, you lose anyone?","Oh man, Jan, called me in September and said 'You gotta fire four people,' and I was just like, 'What?' Ya know?"
2094,"Oh man, Jan, called me in September and said 'You gotta fire four people,' and I was just like, 'What?' Ya know?",Did you?
2095,Did you?,"No, I just ignored her. She's the worse."
2096,What? You like Jan? How can you,"Maybe because she's my girlfriend. [starts retracting statement] Was, or not my girlfriend. She's... we hooked up and..."
2097,You hooked up with Jan?,"You know, months ago, just once, It's, just stupid. Just forget it,"
2098,"[to Ryan] Cool. Hey, so... do you want to... do something tonight? Or...","[under breath] Oh, no, not while I'm here."
2099,Ditto. [to Jan] How are you Jan?,Fine Michael. Thank you.
2100,"What is a business? Is it a collection of numbers and sales reports? Sure. But as you know, David and Jan, it is much more. [plays video on screen. David and Jan have confused looks on their faces.]","[video dialogue for 'The Faces of Scranton'] Life moves a little slower in Scranton, Pennsylvania. And that's the way we like it. Because at Dunder Mifflin Scranton, we're not just in the paper business, we're in the people business. Let's meet some of the folks that make the Scranton branch so special. [video shows Stanley at desk] This is Stanley Hudson, one of our talented salesman. An African-American father of two, Stanley's dedication is no doubt one of the hallmark's of the foundation of the business we're hoping to build our bases on."
2101,Questions?,"Wow. OK, OK, thank you Michael, that was great."
2102,"But, for right now what, I would really like to know about is the branch's performance, so do you have that information as well?","Yes, absolutely David. Get that for you. I umm... [hands over report]"
2103,[with flowers] Can you sign?,Yeah.
2104,Nothing for me?,[walks away] Join the club.
2105,Whose it from? [to Oscar],My mom. [puts card in pocket]
2106,"You know what? Here's the deal, Kelly. It would be really nice if he was in to you, right? It'd be great, but he isn't.","Yeah, it would be so great if he was."
2107,"Okay, cool. Is it okay if I invite Ryan? [Jim leaves]","And that about does it, thank you."
2108,"Um, I'm sorry, what did you think financial presentation meant?","I was under the impression this was, more of like... a meet and greet type deal."
2109,"So, does that mean you don't have the numbers on your branch?","That is correct, yes."
2110,"Craig, you realize that we're trying to decide whether if drastic steps need to be taken?","Look, I'm sorry, I didn't know."
2111,"Oh man, you know what? Michael made that stupid movie, he doesn't get into any trouble? Maybe I should have slept with you, too. [David looks at Jan, who glares at Michael.]","Oh, ok. Alright."
2112,"Yeah, Michael - the CFO thinks that we slept together. Do you understand, people get fired for much less? And I just [scratches head] can't believe that you told everybody and we didn't even sleep together.","Technically, we fell asleep in the same bed. So..."
2113,"Oh, God. Michael. It was months ago. It was once, It's over. Do you understand?",Yes. I'm sorry. I will fix this. I'll talk to him. I'll talk to David.
2114,"Surely, you cannot be serious?",I am serious. And don't call me Shirley. Airplane.
2115,You almost ready to go?,"I guess, yeah."
2116,What's wrong?,"Nothing, it's just I had to sit here all day, while Phyllis got like an entire garden delivered to her."
2117,"What, you're mad at me?","I mean, I know that we said no big gifts, but I was kind of hoping you'd get me"
2118,You made a joke?,"I did, it was stupid. And Craig, you saw him, he's not the sharpest tool in the shed. Although he is a tool. [David grins]"
2119,Heading out?,"Yeah. Alright, Beesly, Hey, Happy Valentine's Day."
2120,"Everybody, hello, can I have your attention, please? Since it's Valentine's Day, there's something that I wanted to say. I love the women of this office. Pam, I love you.",Michael's got a few tricks for Valentine's Day. He found a place where you can get 12 plastic roses for $10 and he's got a great line. 'Me so thorny.'
2121,"I love ladies, always have. And you know what I think is the most attractive part of a woman's body? The brains. Because I don't think a woman is beautiful unless she is smart. And also, the brains are where the ladies get their best nasty ideas for bedroom stuff.","You have any big Valentine's Day plans, Kev?"
2122,"You have any big Valentine's Day plans, Kev?","Not really, my fiance is out of town."
2123,Where is she?,I'm not sure. Arizona? Sometimes she doesn't tell me.
2124,I'm not sure. Arizona? Sometimes she doesn't tell me.,Cool.
2125,"That's a lot of noodles. How much sodium do you think is in that cup? This place used to be full of hookers and porn shops and it's not that way anymore. There's an old building. That one hasn't been torn down yet, but they will. They'll get to it.","Happy Valentine's Day, Meredith."
2126,"So, what are you doing for Valentine's Day?",I'm gonna spend it with my fiance.
2127,What are you guys doing?,Probably go grab dinner with my girlfriend. He's gonna be pulling his pud watching Skinemax. [points to Vance Refrigeration Worker #2]
2128,"Okay, here's the thing about Jan. She talks such a big game about, 'Oh there's nothing between us and stop talking about it.' And 'Border-line harassment when you call me at home.' But let me ask you this, is it just a coincidence that this meeting is taking place on Valentine's Day? Answer, maybe, but maybe not. We shall see.",How do you spell 'animalian'?
2129,How do you spell 'animalian'?,Animalian?
2130,Animalian?,Yes.

2133,"No, you know what? You do it.","No, I'm not gonna do that."
2134,So now you're writing two things?,"Dwight lives on a beet farm and he practices karate at the forth grade level. And he apparently has a girlfriend, so... I guess there really is someone for everybody."
2135,"[phone ringing] Hi, this is Kevin. Stacy? Happy Valentine's Day. Yeah. Oh, awesome. Okay. Yeah, I'll be leaving here soon. Cool. I love you, too. Okay, 'bye. Stacy's back.","That's great, man."
2136,You know what? It was nice to see Devon again. To sort of get closure on that whole thing.,Let's think this through. If we ask Corporate for that then...
2137,Can we not?,"No! Yes, we have to! You know why? Because I don't like to be cooped up in that office! In that box! All day long. [Michael starts playing with a football in the office] Heisman! Because I need to think. Okay, Jim? Oh, Kevin, oh! [laughs] Nice catch. Mmmm, mmm, mmm,mmm. Os-car! Intercepted."

2141,"Oh, great. Tasty, terrific pizza. Hmm. Question: Do their pizzas play DVDs?","Dwight was the top salesman of the year at our company.

2312,Can I have a quarter? I promise I'll pay you back.,Sure.
2313,Can I have a dollar? Then I can buy chips and a drink.,Okay. There you go.
2314,Will you marry my mom?,Melissa. Hey. I was working. I was in the middle of something.
2315,Did you draw that?,"Yeah. Do you like to draw, Abby?"
2316,"Yeah. Do you like to draw, Abby?","Yeah, I wanna be an artist when I grow up."
2317,"So, how's your day been?",Okay. It's been a little more tiring than I thought.
2318,"Oh, I hate to break it to you, Abby. The certificate's a fake. Okay? It's not real. Where's the certification number, Halpert?","Actually, I have the certification number right here."
2319,"Oh, really? Uh-huh.",Yup.
2320,Who is this guy again?,Don't worry about Phil. He drives a corvette. He is doing just fine. Okay. Calling cards are... the wave of the future. These things sell themselves.
2321,Who uses calling cards anymore?,"You know what? That's a nice attitude, Ryan, I'm just helping you invest in your future, my friend."
2322,"You know what? That's a nice attitude, Ryan, I'm just helping you invest in your future, my friend.",This sounds like a get rich quick scheme.
2323,"Didn't you lose a lot of money on that other investment, the one from the email?","You know what, Toby? When the son of the deposed king of Nigeria emails you directly, asking for help, you help! His father ran the freaking country, okay? ...Alright, so, raise your hand if you wanna get rich. [Jim and Dwight raise their hands] Alright."
2324,"You know what, Toby? When the son of the deposed king of Nigeria emails you directly, asking for help, you help! His father ran the freaking country, okay? ...Alright, so, raise your hand if you wanna get rich. [Jim and Dwight raise their hands] Alright.","No, um. How is this not a pyramid scheme?"
2325,"No, um. How is this not a pyramid scheme?","Alright, let me explain. Again. [draws on board] Phil has recruited me and another guy. Now, we are getting three people each. The more people that get involved, the more who are investing, the more money we're all going to make. It's not a pyramid scheme, it is a... it's not even a scheme per se, it's... [Jim draws a triangle around Michael's diagram] ... I have to go make a call."
2326,Oh ho ho! What?,I said happy birthday.
2327,What's up?,"Hey. ...Oh, happy birthday."
2328,Did you hear anything yet?,No. I'm still waiting.
2329,Ebay. Hm. Question! May I be in charge of the party planning festivities?,"Not necessary, the party planning committee is all over it.  They've been working twenty-four seven all day yesterday."
2330,"When should we bring out the cake, one or one thirty?",One's good.
2331,"One thirty. [Pam yawns] I'm sorry, are we boring you?","Party planning committee, listen up. Michael would like trick candles for his birthday cake, so make that a priority."
2332,Where do we get those?,Not my problem. Here is a list of things that Michael would like to be surprised by. [hands list to Pam]
2333,Michael wants a strippergram?,"Yes, but he doesn't want to know when, or whom."
2334,[answering phone] Yeah?,"Michael, I have Jan on the line."
2335,"Really? 'Cause, I thought we had the same birthday.","...Happy birthday, Michael."
2336,Am I on camera?,Nope. Totally private. You can say whatever is in your heart. [Jan hangs up]
2337,"Man, I'm so sorry. When do you find out?",They said this afternoon. They're waiting on a second opinion.
2338,Second opinion on what?,"Um, I might have skin cancer."
2339,Who brought in donuts?,Somebody got donuts for my birthday!
2340,Are you serious?,Mmm.
2341,"Here we go. Ohhhkay, this is great! [giggles] Thank you my friends, she is perfect! Ahhh, Dwight, may I have your chair please? And, um, some singles, if you will! Allllright. Nnnnn-dink! [puts single into delivery woman's pocket, giggles] Okay, um, alright. This has arms. Is that gonna be a... is that alright?",Uh... s-sure.
2342,[eating donuts while Dwight plays the recorder] Stop it. Stop! What is that?,"It's 'For the Longest Time,' by William Joel. It's you favorite song."
2343,When does he hear?,Sometime today.
2344,What?,"Listen up everyone! It is 11:23 exactly, the exact moment when you emerged from your mother's vaginal canal, so... huh?! Right, have a seat. Please."
2345,"Listen up everyone! It is 11:23 exactly, the exact moment when you emerged from your mother's vaginal canal, so... huh?! Right, have a seat. Please.","[grinning] Ohhh, God."
2346,...I feel like we should go get Kevin something. Do you think we can sneak out of here?,"Maybe, but... we're gonna need somebody to create a diversion, and..."
2347,"On three, we're going to hoist away! Ready?",Okay.
2348,"F. Alright, what's the damage?","Uh, thirty-nine sixty."
2349,"Why tip someone for a job I'm capable of doing myself? I can deliver food. I can drive a taxi. I can, and do, cut my own hair. I did, however, tip my urologist, because... I am unable to pulverize my own kidney stones.",Here they come.
2350,What is this?,"Uh, bologna, tomato and ketchup."
2351,These are all the same?,Yes.
2352,Bologna? I don't eat bologna.,"Well, then just have the tomato and ketchup. Still good."
2353,[making peanut butter and jelly sandwich] Someone ate three feet of that thing?,"Hell, yeah. Save room for ice cream cake."
2354,What about that meeting... later... to discuss finances?,Yes... [whispering] but don't expect any cookie.
2355,[whispering] But what if i'm hungry?,[whispering]
2356,[puts fabric softener into cart] ...What?,You use fabric softener?
2357,You use fabric softener?,"Yeah, you don't?"
2358,"Yeah, you don't?","No, I do."
2359,Hello? Hey.,Kevin? Respect the birthday please.
2360,Kevin? Respect the birthday please.,"No, um, no not yet. I will. Bye. [hangs up] It was just Stacy."
2361,Are you done? ...Good. Okay.,Here we go. Make a wish.
2362,"Okay. Well, when she comes back we'll do it again. [notices Meredith hugging Kevin] Hello, what about the birthday boy? Haven't had a hug all day.",No one cares about your birthday. Kevin's waiting to hear if he has skin cancer.
2363,You dare me? How old are you?,Just... quit stalling.
2364,"[loudspeaker] Jim Halpert? Price check on fabric softener, the kind that gives you...",Ma'am? Please don't touch that. That is not a toy.
2365,Ma'am? Please don't touch that. That is not a toy.,Oh I'm sorry. I'm sorry.
2366,How old are you?,I hate you.
2367,"[to Kevin] Honestly, is there any way you can get on your fiancee's plan? Our health plan is s... just... it's terrible.",There you are. Good news. Did some research. It turns out that 98% of people with skin cancer fully recover.
2368,Why are you here? I didn't even invite you to my birthday party.,I work here.
2369,"Where have you been? And don't say the bathroom, 'cause I kicked in all the stalls.","Well that's an invasion of privacy, so, I'm going to tell Michael."
2370,Is this trip related in any way to your... birthday?,How dare you sir. You are gross.
2371,"No, it's alright. It's already up. Just leave it. Where's Kevin? Come on! Let's get our skate on!",Don't be scared! You're good! You're good!
2372,Think you can let go?,No. [laughs]
2373,Who is that?,Is that Michael?
2374,Is that Michael?,"Yeah, I've been pretty much skating my whole life. I thought about playing in the NHL, but, you're on the road so much. You got no time to spend with your wife and kids. And I really want a wife and kids."
2375,"Hey Pam, all this stuff with Kevin... um, it's pretty scary. And I'm thinking that uh, next time you're in the shower, you should check yourself out. You know, give yourself an exam. Those things are like ticking time bags. Alright? Think about it.",...It's something to think about.
2376,"I can't relax about it, you know?",Kevin. You heard anything yet?
2377,Kevin. You heard anything yet?,"No, not yet."
2378,Michael?,"Yeah. Carol? She sold me my condo! Hey! What, is this place on the market? Or..."
2379,"Yeah. Carol? She sold me my condo! Hey! What, is this place on the market? Or...","Uhh, no, I... don't just sell real estate. Uh, my daughter has a skating lesson."
2380,"Oh, these... all your kids?",No just the front two.
2381,"Oh, hey guys. Whats up? You wanna go for a ride? Is that okay?",Sure.
2382,Cool. Alright. Grab on. Here we go. Ready? Hang on tight. Alright. We are moving. We are reaaallly mooovin' now!,Push. Good! That's great. You got it. [Kevin's phone rings] Excuse me.
2383,"Hello? Yeah okay. Alright. Okay, I will, thanks. [hangs up] It was negative.","Oh... God... [stomps] God! [throws hockey stick and yellow paper bracelet down] We're gonna beat this, okay? We're gonna... come here [hugs Kevin]."
2384,"Oh... God... [stomps] God! [throws hockey stick and yellow paper bracelet down] We're gonna beat this, okay? We're gonna... come here [hugs Kevin].","Well, apparently in the medicine community, negative means good. Which makes absolutely no sense. In the real world community, that would... be... chaos."
2385,"Okay, who's this from? Wowwwee, look at that! Jersey!",Turn it around. Turn it around.
2386,Michael?,Yeah.
2387,"That's not how I taught you, right? [singing] My hump, my hump, my lovely lady lump Check it out [Dwight imitating drumbeat]","Michael's birthday is hard for me because he gets very excited. But he's also under a lot of pressure, which builds up until he's ready to explode. As his right-hand man, it's my job to release that pressure so that he can enjoy himself, if only for a moment."
2388,Can you please stop staring at me? [Dwight continues to stare and then walks away],"To think that a man's skin could turn on him. It's brilliant, 'cause you'd never expect it. Most people think of their skin as an ally. [scoffs] Makes me rethink having skin at all."
2389,"Let's go over some of the symptoms of marijuana use, shall we?  You tell me who this sounds like: slow moving, inattentive, dull, constantly snacking, shows a lack of motivation.",[nods] Hey...
2390,"And the guys are saying, chug, chug, chug, but I'm so small and all I'd eaten that day was one of those Auntie Anne pretzels from the food court so I said 'Is it okay if I sip it?' and they said no, but Ryan seemed cool either way.","Stop! This is not Kelly Kapoor story hour.  Illegal drugs were consumed on company property, okay? Your ass is on the line, mister!  My ass is is on the line!  Now I'm going to ask you again.  What time did you go home last night?"
2391,"Stop! This is not Kelly Kapoor story hour.  Illegal drugs were consumed on company property, okay? Your ass is on the line, mister!  My ass is is on the line!  Now I'm going to ask you again.  What time did you go home last night?",Six.
2392,What's the hard way?,"I go down to the police station on my lunch break. I tell a police officer, I know several, what I suspect you may have in your car. He requests a hearing from a judge and obtains a search warrant, once he has said warrant, he will drive over here, and make you give him the keys to your car, and you will have to obey him."
2393,"Ry, is he bugging you? Dwight, dude, you gotta take a chill pill, man. It was one joint in the parking lot. You know, you're totally harshing the office mellow.",I can't stop this investigation. It is my job.
2394,"Why don't you just cool it, cool it Dwight, please, God! [to Jim] Dude, where's my office? [Jim quietly laughs] I totally lost it, 'cause I was half-baked. Smokin' doobies. Doobie brothers, I was smokin' doobies with my brothers. Peace out, Seacrest!","Well, your office is behind you."
2395,Thanks. M-m-munchies. Who wants some munchies?,I don't think Michael's ever done drugs. I don't know if anyone has ever offered him any.
2396,Oscar visited Mexico when he was five to attend his great-grandmother's funeral. What does that mean to a United States law enforcement officer? He's a potential drug mule.,Have you ever taken any illegal drugs?
2397,Have you ever taken any illegal drugs?,"No, I have not."
2398,Do you think it's possible that maybe you could have had some drugs in your system without you knowing about it?,What are you implying?
2399,What are you implying?,Have you ever... pooped... a balloon?
2400,Have you ever... pooped... a balloon?,Okay. I'm done with this.
2401,Do you know what this is? [pushing a photo toward her],"Yes, it's marijuana."
2402,How do you know that?,It's labeled.
2403,"Well, how could you, if it just erased your memory?",That's not how it works.
2404,Now how do you know how it works?,"Knock it off, okay, I'm interviewing you."
2405,No! You said that I'd be conducting the interview when I walked in here. Now exactly how much pot did you smoke?,[opens eyes wide in total surprise]
2406,"Oh, um...[mimicking Stanley] Why do you keep CC'ing me on things that have nothing to do with me?  [Pam and Oscar laugh, Stanley walks in, and Oscar leaves quickly]",Is that supposed to be me?
2407,Is that supposed to be me?,"Oh, hey Stanley. Uh, I was just doing an impression."
2408,Sold out? That has never happened in the history of jinx.,[mouths] C'mon!
2409,Where were you yesterday after work?,[smiles knowingly]
2410,Uh-oh. Uh-oh. Who's he calling?  Ratting somebody out.  Narc!  Narc!  Kevin?,"That is so good, Michael"
2411,"Remember the narc bit? [laughs] Uh-oh, who's in trouble?",Attention everyone.  Drug testers are coming in a couple of hours to test everyone's urine.
2412,Waa... what? What are you talking about?,Company policy. If drugs are found on the premises there is automatic drug testing conducted within twenty-four hours.
2413,"Is that true, Toby?","Oh, when you sign your job application you agree to comply with random drug testing."
2414,"Kevin, what prescription drugs are you taking, besides Rogaine?",I'm not taking Rogaine.
2415,"Angela, what about you?",I don't take any prescription drugs.
2416,"Hey guys, what's going on?","We're having the best conversation.  [Jim, eyes wide, shakes his head, no]"
2417,"Oh, okay.  Well, Michael wants to see everyone in the conference room. [Jim shakes his head. Seems relieved to be getting away from Kelly] But you know what? We have a few minutes so you guys should definitely finish up your conversation. [Jim nods his head as if to say, 'Gee, thanks, Pam.']","So, I was looking so hot..."
2418,"No, uh, no. That was a test.  I was testing you, and you all failed. Miserably. When I said that Dwight was a narc, how many of you defended him?  How many of you said, 'Hey, you know what, he's right? What he's doing is protecting this office from the evils of drugs.'","Thank you, Michael."
2419,Where did you get these facts?,"Are these facts scaring you, or are they not?"
2420,"Are these facts scaring you, or are they not?",They are not.
2421,Do you think that smoking drugs is cool? Do you think that doing alcohol is cool?,"No, I don't. I have a glass of red wine with dinner about once a week.  For the antioxidants."
2422,"Okay, enough, enough, enough! I have written down a list of illegal drugs. Take a gander. How many of these are you familiar with?","Hookah is not an illegal drug, Michael."
2423,"Okay, you know what, Toby? Pam, can you take this down? [Pam throws her hands up to indicate she has no notepad] In addition to Toby's urine being tested, I would like to test his blood and his hair.",You can't do that.
2424,"Okay, eeny, meenie, miney, moe, is random.  Okay, you know what? I'm going to need a volunteer to select one of these words and tell us of something tragic that happened in either their lives, or the lives of a loved one.  Yeah, Pam.",I know that Jim has an amazing story about a relative of his who got caught up in the world of drugs.
2425,Really? [Jim shakes his head no],"Uh, hmmm."
2426,"Jim it's okay. You can t... [Jim looks at Pam and shakes his head, Pam looks at him and gestures for Jim to go up and tell his story] This would be a good place to let it out, Jim. These are people you can trust. These are people who care about you. [Jim shakes his head no] It's okay, just we will not judge you. We are here to not judge you. [Jim stands up] Oh, he's doing it, okay. [Jim looks at Pam] It's okay. [Jim pretends to try, looking teary eyed, shakes his head no, mouths 'I can't' and sits back down. Pam is amazed.] Oh. Okay, are you sure? [Jim shakes his head. Kevin pats his shoulder] That looked like it was going to be good. Alright. [Pam nods in admiration at Jim] Okay, well.",Wow! He really pulled out the big guns. Fake crying. Did not expect that.
2427,"Okay, well Dwight just know that I've been very busy today and I got a lot of work to do and I wasn't planning on going to the bathroom and I don't even know if anything is going to come out, okay? So good. Thank you.","Hi, Linda. Dwight Schrute, Assistant Regional Manager. You might remember testing my urine a few years back when I was applying to be a volunteer sheriff's deputy."
2428,"Oh, right. How are you?",I'm all better.
2429,What kind of filing?,Just forget it.  Just the urine.
2430,Like in a cup?,"Yes in a cup, we're not animals, Dwight."
2431,For what purpose?,It's none of your business.
2432,Are you serious?,I need clean urine for the lady.
2433,Were you forced to do drugs at this concert?,"No, just look. Look. Just... just fill up the cup."
2434,Do you want to give Michael your urine?,I want him to have all the urine he needs.
2435,I know that. Don't you think I know that?,"Yeah, we do testing all over the country."
2436,"Cool.  Hey, are you guys hiring?",You want to work at the urinalysis lab?
2437,You want to work at the urinalysis lab?,Yeah.  Maybe.
2438,"What? [Jim shakes his head] Did you want to tell me something? You look like you want to tell me something. [Jim shakes his head no] You look like you have something really important to say and you just can't for some reason. [Jim smiles] Come on, you can tell me. Jim, you can tell me anything. [Jim stops smiling and looks down. Pam wonders what that means]",I'd like a magazine.
2439,What's wrong? Where's your costume?,It's a uniform and I turned it in today when I tendered my resignation.
2440,Why?  Wha...,I took an oath when I was sworn in and I broke that oath today.
2441,How much time do you have left on your break?,Ten minutes.
2442,Really?,"Yes, sir."
2443,So you wanna? Thanks.,"Dwight K. Schrute, I hereby declare you an honorary voluntary corporal in charge of assisting all activities security."
2444,"Thank you, Michael. Very nice. Great. [To Hank]  Can I have a gun?","No, I don't have a gun."
2445,"First of all, Hank, how many orange traffic cones do you have?",Two.
2446,Wow. What a terrible day to not be able to talk.  Dwight was literally carrying around his own urine and dressed like one of the Village People. Why does he do the things that he does for Michael?  I just don't get it. What is he getting out of that relationship?,[growling] Nice.
2447,And what did you say?,I said no.
2448,Last night? Let's see.,Go ahead. Don't lie.
2449,I won't. It's just that last night is really hard for me to remember because I was just a teensy bit high. Should I have not said that?,"No, no, no. It's okay. Go ahead."
2450,Pam said you had something important to tell me. Is it bad? Am I getting fired? [Jim shakes head 'no'] Why aren't you telling me? It must be bad. They're taking away my kid. I knew it. [Jim waves arms and shakes head 'no'] They're not taking away my kid. Oh.,"Oh, sure, I can definitely help you with that. Okay? Please hold."
2451,"Oh, sure, I can definitely help you with that. Okay? Please hold.","Kelly Kapour. Say your prayers. Let's go. Conference room, pronto. Come on, step it up."
2452,How?,Exactly. I know. It's amazing.
2453,"No, how could it reach the moon? Like, would you make it into a rope, or...","I have some hemp ropes at my house, they're really strong..."
2454,"Oh, me? Just one of the gang. Sitting in the back, doodling, not playing attention. Bam! Pow! Surprise! Got you! [Note pad reads, 'Creed -Shifty eyes / Ryan - Dilated pupils / Kelly - Hyperactive'] There's a Volunteer Sheriff's Deputy in your midst, and he is taking names.","One thing that you need to remember is that there's no way of knowing who's a user, who's an abuser, because we don't know. It could be anybody. Your instinct is to say it's somebody-like Stanley or Oscar..."
2455,Excuse me?,"No, no! Your instinct. That... Your gut reaction is to say that, but I don't! That's, that's... Those are instincts that have been created by media and hype. And they are wrong. What I am saying is that you just do not know who drug users are. It may be the person you least suspect. It may be somebody hot, like Pam, or it could be somebody matronly, like Phyllis, but just not me."
2456,"No? okay, fine.","[on the phone] Michael, I'm gonna get going. I really don't think I need to be in this meeting."
2457,Has she been on the phone the whole time?,Yeah. Sorry you had to hear that. It was a lovers' quarrel.
2458,"Okay, let's get personal for a second, shall we?","The scary thing is, it could have been any one of these people. They all had a motive. To get high."
2459,"I don't... Let's just not talk about it, okay?",[reading from Michael's flier] 'Drugs: Let's not and say we did.' I think Michael was high when he wrote this.
2460,"You know, sometimes I wish we just didn't have a conference room. [Kelly laughs] You know? He couldn't do that.",But then we wouldn't have any meetings.
2461,"Oh, my God. Oh, my God, oh, my God. Hello? Yes, I am so, so sorry. Yeah, actually, I don't have that information just yet. Uh-huh. Listen, do you mind if I put you on a brief hold? Okay.","I look forward to drug testing. I used to get a runner's high, which is why now I swim."
2462,"Why would I be worried? I'm not a drug user. I would never abuse my body like that. I mean, they are plenty of other ways to have fun. My body is 100% drug-free.","[telephone ringing] Dunder Mifflin. This is Pam. Um, hold, please. [to Jim] There's a Brenda on the phone for you. [to Brenda] Just one second, I'll transfer."
2463,Sheriff Pierce? I'm turning in my badge.,Where sis you get that?
2464,Where sis you get that?,I got it here.
2465,"Right, well... Why don't you give me a couple examples of ways that you've helped us out?","Oh, God, there are so many. Roadside assistance, breaking up unruly parties, surveillance..."
2466,Surveillance?,"Crowd control, directing traffic..."
2467,Mace! You... You've been carrying around weapons-grade Mace?,I've only had to use it once.
2468,"So, uh... you found a band for your wedding yet?",No.
2469,Yeah?,"Yeah, pretty stationery."
2470,"Uh, on or off?",Off.
2471,Oh! What is on your face? Is that a disguise?,[leaving the room] Excuse me.
2472,"I.D. badges are long overdue. Security in this office park is a joke. Last year, I came to work with my spud gun in a duffel bag. I sat at my desk all day, with a rifle that shoots potatoes at 60 pounds per square inch. Can you imagine if I was deranged?",That's a nice tie.
2473,That is... who makes that?,"Um, I don't..."
2474,Do you mind if I wear that for the photo?,"Um...  let's um, let's keep our clothes."
2475,[walking into the Conference room] What's the dealio?,"Just letting Oscar vent a little. We would use the break room, but the photographer's back there today."
2476,What's the problem?,Angela!
2477,"So what, you're having a little spat. I forget, are you guys dating?",No.
2478,"Michael, can I talk to you for a uh, second please?",Yes.
2479,Yeah?,These things just have a way of working themselves out.
2480,What do you know about conflict resolution? Your answer to everything is to get divorced. So...,Okay.
2481,Okay... what?,That was the right decision for me and my marriage.
2482,"Yeah, well... that's not gonna fly here. Because in this office, it is till death do us part... assuming we don't get downsized. [leans over to Pam] Uh, Pam, will you get Angela and meet us in the conference room please?","[holding up a binder] A mediator's tool chest. Okay, well, before we get started, you should know that are 5 different styles of conflict.[in a comedic voice] My Shaolin temple style defeats your monkey style."
2483,Can we go? I have a lot of work to do.,"No. Okay, this is important. The first style is lose/lose."
2484,What's the next one?,"Just hold on, please! Okay, if we do lose/lose, neither of you gets what you want. Do you understand? You... you would both lose. Now I need to ask you, do you want to pursue a lose/lose negotiation?"
2485,"Just hold on, please! Okay, if we do lose/lose, neither of you gets what you want. Do you understand? You... you would both lose. Now I need to ask you, do you want to pursue a lose/lose negotiation?",Can we just skip to whatever number 5 is - win/win or whatever?
2486,Can we just skip to whatever number 5 is - win/win or whatever?,"Win/Win is number four and number five is win/win/win. The important difference here is with win/win/win, we all win. Me too. I win for having successfully mediated a conflict at work."
2487,"Come on, seriously, that?","I don't like looking at it. It's creepy, and in bad taste, and it's just offensive to me. It makes me think of the horrible, frigid stage mothers who force the babies into it. It's kitsch. It's the opposite of art. It destroys art. It destroys souls. This is so much more offensive to me than hardcore porno. I'm talking about the..."
2488,"How about, I leave it up?","How 'bout, she takes it down?"
2489,"How 'bout, she takes it down?","How about, Angela can keep it up on Tuesdays and Thursdays?"
2490,"How about, Angela can keep it up on Tuesdays and Thursdays?","Okay, that is called a compromise. And it is style 3. And it is not ideal. To sum up, win/win - make the poster into a t-shirt, win/lose - take the poster down, compromise - Tuesdays and Thursdays. And the answer is... make the poster into a t-shirt! Win/win."
2491,You solved it?,Yes.
2492,Are those all the other complains?,Mmm-Hm.
2493,"You can't do that, huh? Huh, ok. Now you and I have a conflict. I order you to give me that file.",That... [shakes head and places hand over the file]
2494,"Okay. [yanks the file away, despite Toby's resistance] There! No more conflict. [looks at the camera] I had to use win/lose on that. It was not pretty. [looks back at Toby] All right... is that it?",[sighs and pulls out a box under his desk] It's all Dwight's.
2495,Ohh... God. Alright. Why do I have to do everything?,"Are you sure? [looks at Oscar, who is front of the camera, holding the baby poster in front of his chest]"
2496,"Are you sure? [looks at Oscar, who is front of the camera, holding the baby poster in front of his chest]","Oh, he's sure. Just shoot."
2497,"How many of you have at one time gone to Toby to complain about another employee? [looks at all the employees, most of whom raise their hands] And... did you get what you wanted, or were you merely listened to, you forget about your problem, and you move on? [employees mumble 'merely listen to and forgotten...' ] That is outrageous! I love this place... and it pains me to see all of the negativity festering... [sighs] Okay, today we are going to get everything out of these files and into the open, where it can be resolved. Alright, how about the Phyllis/Angela dispute?",You already did me.
2498,"That's what she said. [Jim mouths these words along with Michael] The thing is, Angela... you are in here an awful lot. You have complained about everybody in the office, except Dwight, which is odd because everyone else has had run ins with Dwight. Toby, by the way, what does 'redacted' mean? There is a file full of complaints in here marked 'redacted'... ?","Yeah, it just means whoever complained came to me later and withdrew it, so I took their name off."
2499,"Whoa.. wha... wait. If someone has a problem with me, why would they withdraw it six months ago?",[notices Angela's intense concern] Um... let's move on. I volunteer. Did anyone have a problem with me?
2500,[notices Angela's intense concern] Um... let's move on. I volunteer. Did anyone have a problem with me?,"All right, Pamela. Come on down! Let's do it! And [looks through the file]... okay. Just one complaint. Actually, it has been withdrawn. So that is no help to us. Next."
2501,"Wait, what did it say?","Uh... [reading]'Does she have to plan her wedding on office time? Couldn't she do that at home?' [Pam looks Angela an angry look] Who else? Why don't we just warm up first? Warm up emotionally, all right?"
2502,"Uh... [reading]'Does she have to plan her wedding on office time? Couldn't she do that at home?' [Pam looks Angela an angry look] Who else? Why don't we just warm up first? Warm up emotionally, all right?",I have this kind of big secret about Angela. And I've been really nice to her... and I haven't told anyone. And what the hell?!
2503,I have this kind of big secret about Angela. And I've been really nice to her... and I haven't told anyone. And what the hell?!,"Here is a Kelly complaint: 'Ryan never returns my calls.' Ugh, join the club."
2504,[crumbles up the complaint paper] Makin' progress. [Jim raises his hand] Yes?,Dwight tried to kiss me.
2505,What?!,And I didn't tell anyone because I'm not really sure how I feel about it.
2506,"Okay, question. [looks at Toby] When a name is withdrawn, does that also apply to the permanent misbehavior file in New York?",Sure.
2507,"Then why is there a picture of a white man on the door? [Michael, along with the camera, look at the standard stick man on the bathroom door.]","Okay, Phyllis. You complained that Angela's giving you dirty looks. And you tried to get off the party planning committee."
2508,"[sighs] Well, what does Roy think about everything?",I don't know. I try not to bother him about this kind of stuff.
2509,You mean your thoughts and feelings?,Yeah.
2510,"OK, Ryan.  You told Toby that Creed has a distinct old man smell?",I know exactly what he's talking about. I sprout mung beans on a damp paper towel in my desk drawer. Very nutritious. But they smell like death.
2511,"Hey... you know what, Dwight? Maybe we should get our photo I.D. taken together.",That doesn't make any sense.
2512,What did I write?,I have another complaint for Jim's permanent file.
2513,What box?!,But I didn't report your snoring-
2514,No! You calm down! Who's side is Toby on? Who's side are you on?,"Hey, hey!"
2515,Him or me?,Stop.
2516,Him or me? I cannot work with Jim anymore.,Okay...
2517,Okay?,Yes.
2518,[picks up Dwight's I.D. and snickers] You know your I.D. says you're a security threat?,You have till five.
2519,"Oh, look, Jim. There's a sales manager position open in Stamford. Want me to call Jan and tell her you're interested? I could put in a good word for you, 'cause I'll still be working here. Transfer! Transfer! Everybody! Transfer! Transfer! Transfer! Transfer!","Okay... you two, in the conference room with me. Nobody leaves until we work this out. Cage match!"
2520,"Cage matches? Yeah, they work. How could they not work? If they didn't work, everybody would still be in the cage.","Okay, so Dwight, in your own words - [reads from complaint paper] 'Someone replaced all my pens and pencils with crayons. I suspect Jim Halpert.' [flips to another paper] 'Everyone has called me 'Dwayne' all day. I think Jim Halpert paid them to.'"
2521,"So, you going to transfer Jim or not?","Maybe, I haven't decided yet. Let's get to work."
2522,"Okay. Oh... actually, tomorrow's not good. How about later in the week?",Fine.
2523,Hey! Wait. How about a group picture while you're here?,I can't. I only get reimbursed for the I.D. photos.
2524,"Well... that's... what, a computer camera, right?",You mean digital?
2525,You mean digital?,It'll take like two seconds.
2526,What?,"Angela, I want to talk to you about something."
2527,What?,"No, Pam."
2528,What?!,I'm the one who complained about you.
2529,"[flashback the photo being taken] One, two..[flash goes off] Didn't say three, did I?","But, I'm sort of an expert at Photoshop, so it turned out fine in the end. When people work together, there is going to be conflict. You can't outrun your problems."
2530,[elevator bell dings] What is this? What happened here?,I don't know.
2531,"Oh, this does not look good. Did anyone see what happened around my desk area this morning?","Dwight, I really think someone's probably just playing a prank on you, so just go right through it."
2532,"A prank, huh? This is official police line tape, okay? It's not a prank.",Probably is.
2533,Maybe poison?,Possibly.
2534,"[exclaiming in fear] No, Jim, no! [Jim knocks Dwight's phone off its cradle] [yelling toward the phone] Sheriff, this is Volunteer Sheriff's Deputy Dwight Schrute. Press the pound key! What's your 20?",Nothing much is happening today. We are having our photo IDs taken. Whoop-de-doo. Can't always be like The Apprentice.
2535,"I hate it when people don't tell each other why they're angry. My dad was like that. I would say, 'What's wrong, Dad? What's wrong, Dad? What's wrong, Dad? What's wrong, Dad? What's wrong, Dad? What's wrong, Dad?' Over and over and over. And he would just look at me like I was an idiot.",I'm the one who petitioned the office board to have these ID badges taken.
2536,So there were no death threats?,Let me see your ID.
2537,"There is this old story about two women who each think they are the mother of this baby. And they can't decide, so they bring the baby to a wise man. Just like a manager in those days. And the wise man says, 'I will adopt this baby and raise it as a Hindu.' See? They didn't expect that. And that fixed it. Because I think he was the dad anyway.","There are dozens of old complaints in here. Cold cases, like the show. [imitating gonging] And Toby is a lazy detective who has decided that these armed robberies and rapes and murder/suicides are not important enough to solve. Well, you know what? I have a problem with that. And I'm going to open up these cases before Toby can kill or rape another person."
2538,"There are dozens of old complaints in here. Cold cases, like the show.

I have a problem with that. And I'm going to open up these cases before Toby can kill or rape another person.",All right.
2539,"That's not bad. Hey, do you do weddings?",Would you seriously want your wedding photos to look like that?
2540,Would you seriously want your wedding photos to look like that?,Not bad.
2541,What does Level Red mean?,"I'd tell you, but then I'd have to kill you. [laughing maniacally]"
2542,"Cage Match'? I don't know if it was in the packet from corporate, because I barely read any of it. So if you're asking if I stole their idea, the answer is no.","Excuse me, sir! Dwight Schrute, is that your real name?"
2543,"Excuse me, sir! Dwight Schrute, is that your real name?","Yes, sir."
2544,Excuse me. How long is the wait for a table for two?,"I would never, ever serve you. Not in a million, billion years."
2545,"So, what's the deal? We gotta pay for our own drinks? That's lame.","Come on, it'll be fun, and besides, I'm a roulette expert."
2546,"Oh, really? Mmm-hmm.",Yeah.
2547,How would you do that?,Mind control.
2548,[laughs] You can't be serious. Are you serious?,"Ever since I was a little kid, like, eight or nine, I could sort of control things with my mind."
2549,"[scoffs] That's ridiculous. You know what? Uh... Why don't you move that coat rack? Excuse me, everyone! Attention in the office, please. Jim is about to prove his telekinetic powers and he needs absolute silence. Go ahead.","Okay, I'll try. [The coat rack wobbles] [Pam holds up an umbrella handle to the camera in another scene]"
2550,Michael?,Yeah?
2551,Yeah?,You know that I'm very serious here.
2552,What?,"Emeril. Oh, actually, while I have you, not that I have you or have ever had you, but we're having our Casino Night tonight and I think everyone would love to see their fearless leader here."
2553,Again? We do that every year.,"Well, they need our money. They don't have cookies like the Girl Scouts."
2554,"We are giving money that has been gambled. Why don't we just deal drugs or prostitute ourselves,  and donate that money to charity?","Oh, and another fun thing. We, at the end of the night, are going to give the check to an actual group of Boy Scouts. Right, Toby? We're gonna..."
2555,"Oh, and another fun thing. We, at the end of the night, are going to give the check to an actual group of Boy Scouts. Right, Toby? We're gonna...","Actually, I didn't think it was appropriate to invite children since it's... You know, there's gambling and alcohol, and it's in our dangerous warehouse and it's a school night... And, you know, Hooters is catering. You know, is that enough? Should I keep going?"
2556,"Actually, I didn't think it was appropriate to invite children since it's... You know, there's gambling and alcohol, and it's in our dangerous warehouse and it's a school night... And, you know, Hooters is catering. You know, is that enough? Should I keep going?","Why are you the way that you are? Honestly, every time I try to do something fun or exciting, you make it not... that way. I hate so much about the things that you choose to be. Okay, you know what? I will not donate my winnings to Comic Relief, since apparently it doesn't exist. I am going to donate to Afghanistanis with AIDS."

2558,What?,Afghani.
2559,"Wait, canine AIDS?",No. Humans with AIDS.
2560,Who has AIDS?,"Guys, the Afghanistananies."
2561,"Okay, you know what? No. No. AIDS is not funny. Believe me, I have tried.","There are certain topics that are off-limits to comedians, JFK, AIDS, the Holocaust. The Lincoln Assassination just recently became funny. 'I need to see this play like I need a hole in the head.' [laughs] And I hope to someday live in a world where a person could tell a hilarious AIDS joke. It's one of my dreams."
2562,What are you doing?,"Oh, nothing."
2563,"Wait, wait, where you going? I mean, even if you don't hire a band, you still have to watch the bands. Pam, these are people who have never given up on their dreams. I have great respect for that. And, yes, they're all probably very bad and that will make me feel better about not having dreams.",There's a KISS cover band in here.
2564,"Why did I talk to Jan about transferring? Well, you know... I have no future here.",I have already put down the deposit. Do you understand how a deposit works?
2565,I have already put down the deposit. Do you understand how a deposit works?,"Mike, I am not having fire-eaters in a paper warehouse."
2566,Why are you here?,"When Darryl was coming, you said you wanted me here for protection."

2573,"[on phone] Hello, Michael?","Hi, Carol. How you doing?"
2574,"Hi, Carol. How you doing?",I'm great. I just needed one last signature for your mortgage insurance.
2575,"Oh, good, I'm glad. Can I drop it over later?","Actually, I'm sort of hosting this charity thing in our warehouse, Casino Night."

2577,To the casino thing?,Yeah. It'll be fun. What do you...[phone rings] What do you...
2578,What?,"Oh, I'm sorry. Could you hold on? Yes?"
2579,"Oh, I'm sorry. Could you hold on? Yes?","Michael, Jan's on line two."

2587,What?,I'd love to go.

2589,Can I get you a drink? The food is from Hooters.,Drink would be good.
2590,I'm gonna get a drink. Do you need anything?,"No, I'm fine. Thank's sweetheart."
2591,Your nurse became your girlfriend? Sweet.,She was never my nurse. I met her at Chili's. She was my waitress.
2592,[Under his breath] Will Lady Fortune give me a raise?,"Shut it, shut it, shut it. Will Lady Fortune be your mistress? Only time will tell, my friends. Leave all your preconceived notions about casinos at the door. Old friends, new lovers, and the disabled!  Welcome all! Great, okay. Shuffle up and deal. Let's get it started! Black-Eyed Crows."

2595,"Well, Toby, I went all-in on the first hand, so doesn't that tell you that I might have good cards, too? So don't be stupid. Just take it back.","No, I'm sorry. He can't, sir. He's gone all-in."
2596,"Yeah, whatever. Hey, you know what? If luck weren't involved, I would always be winning. [Sees Jan] Oh, my God. Oh, my God.",Michael?
2597,Michael?,Jan.
2598,"What are you... Just... Wait, what're you talking about?",What does that mean?
2599,What does that mean?,"After you said you weren't coming, I invited Carol to come and I don't think that I did anything wrong."

2632,What are you doing? What do you expect me to say to that?,I just needed you to know. Once.
2633,"Love triangle. Drama. All worked out in the end, though. The hero got the girl. Who saw that coming? I did. And Jan was really happy for me. So actually the hero got two girls. He got the girl that he works with and he got the girl that he buys real estate from. So, I've got my New York girl and my local flavor. Life is good.","[On phone] About 10 minutes ago. No, I didn't know what to say.  Yes, I know.  Um, I don't know, mom, he's my best friend.  Yeah, he's great.  Yeah, I think I am. [Jim enters] I have to go. I will. Listen, Jim... [They kiss]"

2641,Hey. Okay. You know what? Don't even think. I command you to just go down and have fun tonight. All right? Don't think about it.,"Our numbers are down, yes, but we have a heck of a crew here in Scranton. Hardworking, motivated, dynamic. Every single last one of them. They follow my lead. I sort of set the tone. And it doesn't hurt that my ex works for corporate. Jan loves this branch, and I think that's really more than half the battle."
2642,"Hey. Meredith, right?","Oh, God. Oh, no. I have this problem all the time. I never remember people I've had sex with."
2643,No I'm not drunk.  Are you drunk?,No... [Jim leans in for another kiss] Jim---
2644,Are you really gonna marry him?  [Pam nods] ...Ok.,"[sobbing] Jim is gone.  He's gone.  I miss him so much.  Ooooh I cry myself to sleep, Jim!  [serious]"
2645,No!  That is the fun of this place.  I call everybody 'faggie'. Why would anybody find that offensive?,OK I think Oscar would just like if you used 'lame' or something like that.
2646,"No.  No it's not.  I feel terrible about it.  I have been calling people 'faggie' since I was in junior high, and I have never made this mistake.  If I don't know how to behave, it is because I am just so far the opposite way, you know?  I'm just... I, I can't even imagine... the... thing.  Maybe we could go out for a beer sometime.  And you could tell me... how... you do that to another dude.","That sounds like a great, wonderful idea, let's do that."
2647,Why did I transfer to Stamford?  I think that's pretty obvious.  I got promoted!  And you can't beat that view... right?,"Hey, Big Tuna!  You're single right?"
2648,"Hey, Big Tuna!  You're single right?","Uh-huh, yeah.  I am."
2649,She's pretty hot huh? [Jim nods]  She's completely crazy.  Steer clear Big Tuna.  Head for open waters.,OooOK.
2650,"Big Tuna is a super ambitious guy, you know?  Cut your throat to get ahead kind of guy, but I mean I'm not threatened by him.  I went to Cornell, you ever heard of it? [laughs]  I graduated in four years.  I never studied once.  I was drunk the whole time, and I sang in the acappella group, 'Here Comes Treble.'","So, end of day we are going to have a little diversity policy refresher, because of some more problems at the Scranton branch.  And I have a list of business startups I got from the chamber.  Yes, I am going to need someone to cold call them."
2651,Jim's nice enough.  I dont... I don't know how well he's fitting in here. He's always looking at the camera like this.  [makes classic 'Jim'-camera face] What is that?,Can you tell who's gay and who's not?
2652,Can you tell who's gay and who's not?,Of course.
2653,What about Oscar?,Absolutely not.
2654,"Hey, what about Angela?   She's hard and severe.  She could be a gay woman.",I really don't think so.
2655,"I don't know, I can imagine her with another woman, can't you?",[creepy smile]
2656,What's gay-dar?,"Well, they're sold out."
2657,Chicken or fish?,[loud sigh] Chicken.
2658,So you havin' a good day?,"Excellent, thanks."
2659,"OK.  Who put my calculator in Jello?  Good one.  But uh, seriously, guys who did this?  Seriously guys, who did this?  I need to know who put my calculator in Jello, or I'm gonna lose MY FRICKIN' MIND!","You know, it's amazing to me that in this day and age, you could be so obtuse about sexual orientation."
2660,"OK, Michael, are you aware that you ousted Oscar today?",What?  What does that even...
2661,What?  What does that even...,"Coming out, is a significant moment for a gay person, and they should be allowed to select the timing and manner of announcing it."
2662,"Well, gay pride, right? Gay pride parade?  It's not like gay... shame festival.","All right, now Oscar's feeling discriminated against by his co-workers, primarily Angela, and um, that's your fault."
2663,I think Angela might be gay.  Could Oscar and Angela be having a gay affair?  Maybe!  Is that what this is about?,NO!
2664,"Michael, your immaturity is extremely disappointing and may even lead to a lawsuit which is the absolute last thing this company needs right now.  Do you understand?","The company has made it my responsibility today to put an end to 100,000 years of being weirded out by gays."
2665,Am I the first gay man you ever knew?,"Trick question!  Cause you can't always tell, so... how would I know.  Is that the right answer?"
2666,"Trick question!  Cause you can't always tell, so... how would I know.  Is that the right answer?","Michael, Dwight's looking at gay pornography on his computer."
2667,What are you doing?!,Watching some of your friends.
2668,"Did you know that gay used to mean happy?  When I was growing up it meant lame.  And now it means a man, who makes love... to other men.","We're all homos!  Homosapiens.  Gays aren't necessarily who you think they are, people.  I mean anybody could be gay.  Business-men.  Like antique dealers, or hairdressers, or... accountants.  Oscar, why don't you take this opportunity to officially come out, to everybody here.  However you want to do it.  Go ahead.  Stand up.  I'm doing this for you."
2669,"Yes I'm gay.  And I didn't plan on sharing that part of my life with you today, so, whatever.  Can I sit down now?",": I'm not offended by homosexuality.

2670,Who should be the judges and juries of our society?,Judges and juries!
2671,"Yes, that's a good point.  She has a good point.  Because gay marriage currently is not legal, under U.S. law.  I bet a lot of straight men wish that applied to them.  So they could go out there and have some torrid unabashed monkey sex as much as they could.  You know?  Sounds pretty good, right?",: That sounds great.
2672,What about Phyllis?  She makes absolutely no attempt to be feminine!,I'm getting married to Bob Vance.

2887,What?,We do not wanna hear about this.

And right now, out there, they're all denying the fact that they're sad.  And that's   hard.  And it's making them all angry.  And it is my job to try to get them all the way through to acceptance.  And if not acceptance, then just depression.  If I can get them depressed, then I'll have done my job."
2890,How are you likin' the new car?,Great.
2891,Yeah?  Sure is small.  Got airbags?,"I think so.  I don't know, I was mainly focused on the cup holders."
2892,"[laughs]  Well, you're not still driving so fast, are you?   Yeah.","[on phone]  Hi, yeah.  This is Mike from the West Side Market.  Well, we get a shipment of Herr's salt and vinegar chips, and we ordered that about three weeks ago and haven't ... . yeah.  You have 'em in the warehouse.  Great.  What is my store number... six.  Wait, no.  I'll call you back. [quickly hangs up] Shut up [to Karen]."
2893,[laughing] Six?,"[as Pam returns to conference room] Okay, we can start.  Um..."
2894,You waited for me?,"Yeah.  Pam, you're a member of this family.  So we will wait for our family members. Phyllis, you wanna give it a shot?"
2895,"Yeah.  Pam, you're a member of this family.  So we will wait for our family members. Phyllis, you wanna give it a shot?","[grabbing ball] I got it.  When my mother was pregnant with me, they did an ultrasound and found she was having twins.  When they did another ultrasound a few weeks later, they discovered, that I had resorbed the other fetus.  Do I regret this?  No.  I believe his tissue has made me stronger.  I now have the strength of a grown man and a little baby."

2897,Do you want to talk about it anymore?,"Oh, it would probably take me like an hour and a half to tell that whole story."
2898,Wait a second.  That's Weekend at Bernie's. [upset] Do you think that this is a game?,"Well, there is a ball."
2899,"Yeah.  Well, you know what?  The guy who had my job has died.  And nobody cares!  And he sat at my desk. [breaking down]","Michael, look.  I know this is hard for you, but death's just a part of life.  I mean, just this morning I saw a little bird fly into the glass doors downstairs and die.  And I had to keep going."
2900,How do you know?,What?
2901,What?,That that bird was dead?  Did you check its breathing?
2902,That that bird was dead?  Did you check its breathing?,It was obvious...
2903,"Was its heart beating, Toby?  Did you check it?  No, of course you didn't.  You're not a veterinarian.  You don't know ANYTHING! [runs out of conference room crying]",Michael! [following Michael downstairs] Michael.   Michael ...
2904,You want me to flush him?,Attention everybody.  This will only take a second of your time.  Today at 4 p.m. we will be meeting in the parking lot to have a funeral service for this bird.
2905,"No, no, no!  That's enough!  You know what?  This bird is dead.  He died alone.  The least you can do is be there for him now. [to Dwight] Find a box for him.",I'm calling a supermarket in Montreal.
2906,[on phone] Bonjour.  Je cherche des tchips de la marque Herr's.  Non?  Ah... merci quand meme.  Au revoir.,Sounded good.
2907,"I mean, how many times to I have to confirm with Ryan [Michael walks away disgusted] for him to know that we have a date tonight?",[trying to shove bird into a can] Argh... gah!
2908,What are... What are you doing?,"What?  No, this is about the right size."
2909,"What?  No, this is about the right size.","No, God, no it's not!  What is the matter with you?  Is that the beak!?"
2910,"No, God, no it's not!  What is the matter with you?  Is that the beak!?","I'm sorry, I grew up on a farm.  We slaughtered a pig whenever we wanted bacon.  My grandfather was reburied in an old oil drum. [pause] It would have fit if he had given me another minute."
2911,Is it for the bird?,Yeah.
2912,Do you have it with you?,Always. [runs off]
2913,Did I wake up this morning thinking I'd be throwing together a bird funeral?  You never can tell what your day here is  gonna turn into.,[spotting Herr's chips on her desk] Where'd you find them?
2914,[spotting Herr's chips on her desk] Where'd you find them?,Where'd I find what?
2915,Where'd I find what?,"I called the manufacturer, who referred me to distributor, who referred me to the vending machine company, who told me that they sell them in the machines in the building next door."
2916,"Dwight, do you have the box?","Actually, I have it."
2917,You made this?  Wow. [impressed] That's... that's very nice.,When I was five my mom told me that my fish went to the hospital in the toilet and it never came back so we had a funeral for it.  And I remember thinking 'I'm a little too old for this.'  And I was
2918,"What do we know about this bird?  You might think, 'Not much.  It's just a bird.'  But we do know some things.  We know it was a local bird.  Maybe it's that same bird that surprised Oscar that one morning with a special present from above.","Oh, I remember that.  That was SO funny."
2919,"And we know how he died.  Flying into the glass doors.  But you know what?  I don't think he was being stupid.  I think he just really, really wanted to come inside our building to spread his cheer and lift our spirits with a song.",He's not a songbird.
2920,Hey Jimmy. Want to see some pictures of my baby?,Umm... sure.
2921,"That's okay. [Hannah shows pic of husband naked with baby] Oh, no, it's not. I'm sorry, is that your husband in the tub with him?",You think we should have left our baby in the tub alone? [Jim shakes head] Talk to me when you have kids.
2922,You think we should have left our baby in the tub alone? [Jim shakes head] Talk to me when you have kids.,Sounds good.
2923,Does his family know?,"Yes, they know, Michael."
2924,But I'm the first in the office?,"I guess, yes. I think it would be appropriate for you to make an announcement to your team, in case they want to pay their respects."
2925,"...'Cause I'm the first to to find out. Nobody else knows and it is my responsibility to tell them. Well, good. How are you holding up? Want me to come over? [Jan hangs up]","Ed Truck died. And it blows. They say that with grief, time makes it worse, which is bad for me because I found out before anybody so I've had more time to be sad."
2926,"What was that, Kevin?",Nothing.
2927,"No, you said something, didn't you?","May he rest in pieces. [chuckles] You know, because there's, like, two pieces of him."
2928,"Well, then I guess that makes you about the worst grief counselor in the world, doesn't it?",Hey there.
2929,So how's your day going?,"Well, I will be spending the entire afternoon in grief counseling for someone I've never met."
2930,Is anyone having any trouble eating?,No.
2931,Concentrating? Is anyone having trouble getting their work done today?,I'm having trouble getting my work done today.
2932,"No. No. Shh. Enough. It is going to take me hours to undo all the damage that your have done here. Dwight, Ryan, I want you to take the table out. We're gonna go on a five minute break, and when you come back, we're going to start with a clean slate, and, in the interim, I would like you to forget everything that Toby has said, okay?","I don't think I'm overstating it when I say that Toby is a plague on this company. And he is worthless. You give people a chance to shine and they blow it, just like you knew they would. Grief counseling is not about, 'Are you hungry? Would you like a sandwich?' These people are so far gone, you have to stick a food tube down their throats."

These people are so far gone, you have to stick a food tube down their throats.","Okay, part of the problem was that Toby talked at you. Now, I am going to talk with you. First off, I want you to be comfortable, because you really can't grieve if you're all tight and buttoned up. So, guys, loosen your ties, just take your jackets off if you want. Ladies, let your hair down. You know what? Even take your shoes off. I wanna get personal and I want you all to really open up. And I want you to know that anything and everything can be said."

I don't think Kevin should take his shoes off.
2935,Really?,Yeah.
2936,Yeah?,"But, umm, thanks for the break."
2937,Hey! Hey! What are you guys doing over there?,"Nothing. Let's just... all right. [talks to warehouse guys] Guys, do you have a box we could use?"
2938,"Nothing. Let's just... all right. [talks to warehouse guys] Guys, do you have a box we could use?",Brain teaser. I have two coins totaling 15 cents and one of them is not a nickel. What are they?
2939,Brain teaser. I have two coins totaling 15 cents and one of them is not a nickel. What are they?,A dime and a nickel.
2940,Nothing?,"Yeah, nothing. How was your day?"
2941,"Yeah, nothing. How was your day?",I don't care how your day was Michael.
2942,"Wow. Well. Ok. I don't care how your day was either, Jan. I was just asking you because you asked me. Why do you set me up like that?",Tell me what you did yesterday.
2943,I worked. And then I went home to my condo. And Carol came over. And then we had sex. Is that what you want to hear?,"Never ever, ever sleep with your boss. I am so lucky that Jan and I only got to second base."
2944,"I'm great. So, Pam I would like you to keep a log of everything Michael does hour by hour so we can analyze it at corporate. Ok?","Oh, I don't know if I'm..."
2945,So you excited?,Yeah.
2946,Very excited?,Yes. I'm very excited.
2947,Extremely excited? ... Just very?  That's cool.,"I have spent a year here. I have to commit or get out. Dwight's the top salesman in the company and he's taking me on my first sales call today. And, um, I'm excited."
2948,"I am very excited. Ryan hasn't made a sale yet, but more importantly, he hasn't made an ally yet. Is he going to be a slacker-loser-wise-ass like Jim was? Or is he going to join the Dwight Army of Champions?","So what if they're not talking much, then does it makes sense to kind of lead the conversation? You know, just 'till it gets to a point where they are asking questions? [car stops] So where's the sales office?"
2949,"So what if they're not talking much, then does it makes sense to kind of lead the conversation? You know, just 'till it gets to a point where they are asking questions?

2950,What?,My chair is squeaking.
2951,Is it?,You took my chair.
2952,"Do you know where we are, temp?",I know where we're not.
2953,Can you stand up? And talk to me over there?,That's it? That's what you came up with?
2954,That's it? That's what you came up with?,I'm acting my heart out here.
2955,Really?,"Yeah, really. You asked for my help, so I helped."
2956,"Productivity is important but how can I be productive if I have this one little thing in my brain? That I cannot get out. And that one little thing is a soft pretzel. So I'm just going to have my soft pretzel, then I'll get to work, and I'll be super productive. Look out for me.","[looks at long pretzel line] Oh, shhh... Come on."
2957,"Smells pretty bad, doesn't it?",Uh huh.
2958,"I wake up every morning in a bed that's too small, drive my daughter to a school that's too expensive, and then I go to work to a job for which I get paid too little, but on Pretzel Day? Well, I like pretzel day.",Because they acted all tough and everything...
2959,"But what they were rapping about was cupcakes and the Chronicles of Narnia. God. Who invented cupcakes, right? I want to...","[Phyllis embraces Bob ahead in line] Hey, hey, hey! Phyllis, what are you doing?"
2960,"[Phyllis embraces Bob ahead in line] Hey, hey, hey! Phyllis, what are you doing?",I'm just saying hi to Bob.
2961,"Hey Dwight, you're a great salesman. Can you teach me? Sure, Ryan. I'll make you the ole commodor.  I'll abandon you in a beet field. Huh. That sounds great, Dwight, I'll really appreciate that. Thank you so much for your mentorship.",Congratulations resourceful salesman. You have passed the second challenge. Welcome to Schrute Farm.
2962,I don't care 'bout anything but you... what ever happened to those guys?,Michael.
2963,You know what your problem is? You know why you haven't made any sales? Cause you think you know everything. You have to trust that maybe there are other people that can teach you things. Are you ready to learn? Are you ready for the final test?,Yeah.
2964,"Is there anyway that you could do all, all of them?",The Works. You got it.
2965,Who was that?,Pay no attention to the spirits that haunt this hallowed ground.
2966,Is that your Cousin Mose?,Yes.
2967,What is the greatest danger facing Dunder Mifflin?,Outsourcing and consolidation of competition.
2968,Wrong. Flash floods. What is the true cause of Robert Mifflin's suicide?,Depression?
2969,Depression?,Wrong. He hated himself. What is the DHARMA initiative?
2970,Wrong. He hated himself. What is the DHARMA initiative?,I can't believe that Ryan is not back yet. Where could they be?
2971,I can't believe that Ryan is not back yet. Where could they be?,Sales take a long time.
2972,"Final question, young Ryan Howard. What is Michael Scott's greatest fear?","Um, loneliness. Maybe women."
2973,Ryan. Don't. Ryan! You don't have to wrestle him. Just get in the coffin. Ryan?,"Bye, Ryan. He seemed nice."
2974,Where are all the animals?,"Ryan, come on. I am sorry. I am sorry. Mose is sorry too. Look, he sent over a basket with eggs and some fat back bacon. And look, something he whittled."
2975,"You still mad? It's just Jim and I didn't get along, and I didn't want it to be that way again. You know, I wanted us to be a team. An unstoppable team that competed against other teams.","Look, that, that's not what I wanted, ok. I just wanted to go on a sales call."
2976,"Mr. Kosseli. Hey hey hey, the Cos. What's going on? Do we have a deal? Deal or no deal? Let's make a deal. So what is the deal?",Establish time frames. Keep the phrase 'real dollars' in their head. And always keep the power in the conversation. That's why you're losing them on the cold calls. Cause you say the word please too much.
2977,"Wait, can you go back?","Michael always said, K.I.S.S. Keep it simple, stupid. Great advice, hurts my feelings every time."
2978,Second?,"Yes, second, Toby. Second, I am insisting on increased accountability from every single one of you."
2979,"Account...? Michael, what is going on?",And I will be taking questions.
2980,"Did you have a lot of sugar today, Michael?",What's on your suit?
2981,What's on your suit?,"Carmel Dip. But, one question at a time please. Phyllis, Stanley. I want you to switch desks, I'm going to reorganize and restructure the physical layout of the office to maximize everything! I think we're getting a lot done, don't you? On paper at least. And we are, after all, a paper company. Are we not, are we not, are we not? Are you with me, are you with me? Thank you very much!"

Thank you very much!",They really didn't like me.
2983,"Not everything's a lesson, Ryan. Sometimes you just fail. It's those online paper jerks. The whole business is changing. You know what? They're going to be screwed once this whole internet fad is over. What are you doing? [Ryan throws egg at building] Oh no no no no! Ryan! Yes! Ryan the temp! Come on! Courtesy of Dunder Mifflin. Come on! Drive.",You drive.
2984,"Dunder Mifflin, this is Pam. Oh, hi Jan. He's, uh, on a sales call. No message? Bye, Jan.","[Dwight chokes as Ryan downs a beer in one drink] Temp! Temp! Temp! Temp! Ryan! Ryan! Ryan! Ryan! Yes! Just think, that temp agency could have sent you anywhere."

2986,AM or PM?,PM.
2987,These came for you. Contracts? Brent Koselli?,Oh. Koselli. With the Jello.
2988,"And I was just going to go through the system cause I didn't think you'd be there. Why, why are you still there?",I had to work late. Jan's making me keep a log of everything Michael does all day.
2989,Wow. Do you think you could send me a copy of that?,"Yeah, totally. So..."
2990,A little different. What time is it there?,"What time is it here? Um, we're in the same time zone."
2991,"What time is it here? Um, we're in the same time zone.","Oh, yeah. Right."
2992,How far away did you think we were?,I don't know. It felt far.

2995,70? How many do you type?,Forget it. I was just about to brag but forget it.
2996,Respectable?,"So ok. I'm watching the movie, by myself..."
2997,No way. How do you confuse 28 Days with 28 Days Later?,Because I got it at Blockbuster and they don't put the pictures on the box.
2998,Would I make that up?,"Yes. Fancy New Beesley would make that up. New apartment, new stories."
2999,And how many kitchens?,I have one kitchen.
3000,Three kitchens?,Yes!  How are you going to cook every meal of the day in one kitchen?
3001,Yes!  How are you going to cook every meal of the day in one kitchen?,"[Ryan and Dwight enter] Hey, Ryan, are you ok?"
3002,"[Ryan and Dwight enter] Hey, Ryan, are you ok?",Pam?

3005,You have to go?,"Yeah, uh, well."
3006,Zoning out?,Do you want me to go on Amazon and order you a slang dictionary? Cause I'll do it.
3007,Do you want me to go on Amazon and order you a slang dictionary? Cause I'll do it.,If you can account for your time...
3008,"Would you look at that? [Hugs Ryan] [Dwight attempts hug] Damn it, Dwight! Come on.","Dwight is taking Ryan on a sales call today. So if we find Ryan's body in a heavily-wooded area tomorrow, I owe Jim $30. It's an old bet, but a deal's a deal."
3009,Don't you realize the key is inside you? [pretends to pull key out of Ryan's ear],He's the top salesman at the company. He's the top salesman at the company. He's the top salesman at the company. Today's gonna be great.
3010,What was that first thing you did?,"[wails arms] You know, selling, typing, dialing."
3011,What is that in your ear? [pretends to pull beet seed out of Ryan's ear] A tiny beet seed. You need to clean your ears better.,It's going okay. I've already learned more about beet agriculture than I ever thought I'd know.
3012,"You know, every time I think I hit rock bottom at my job, the floor opens up, like at a carnival ride. I'm gonna retrace my steps. College, four-year degree, student loans, business school, alone in a beet field. I... there's a step missing. 'Hey, mom.' 'Hey, Ryan. How's that five-year plan coming?' 'Oh, it's great. Today, I knelt down in cow manure and I got abandoned in a beet field.' 'Oh, that's cool.' 'Yeah, that's really cool. I'm learning a lot. I'm really glad I took this full-time job.'","Sales is about people, Ryan. About understanding them and learning how to get along with them. Case study: me. To understand me, you have to know that I work in the city, but I live here on this small, beautiful farm. It's a family farm. Many Schrutes were born here and many of us end up here. My grandfather was a good man who did some very bad things. What the... Damn it! Those kids! [discovers two teenagers naked, running] You! You, get out of here! This is not a cheap motel! This is a farm and cemetery! Freaks! You're lucky I don't have my crossbow! Let me show you the compost pile."
3013,What makes them so good?,I do not know.
3014,"But if you said 'Go ahead, make my day,' I would know that it's from 'Dirty Harry'. How can you not know that's from 'Ferris Bueller's Day Off'?","Yo, mama! Ask me how bad I wanted to bone Jennifer Grey."
3015,You didn't know that 'Bueller?' was from Ferris Bueller?,"Let's just say, me and Jennifer Grey probably would've broken a few laws."
3016,"Tonight, one of our most ethnic co-workers, Kelly, has invited us all to a Diwali celebration put on by her community. What is Diwali, you may ask? Well, to have Kelly explain it [girly voice] it's ada blah blah blah, it's so super fun and it's going to be great. [normal voice] Lot of gods with unpronounceable names. Twenty minutes later you find out that is essentially a Hindu Halloween.",You look so handsome.
3017,How come you didn't get me one?,I...
3018,Do you want to make Appletini's and watch 'Sex and the City' at my place?,"Oh, I don't know. I haven't decided yet."
3019,"I don't get why you won't go. Did I do something wrong? I mean, I thought we were really close friends.","I just feel kind of tired, you know."
3020,"Well, go with Dwight. He's single, too. Right?","Yeah, totally single. Hundred percent available."
3021,Are you guys going to this Indian thing tonight?,"I don't know. Who's... uh, who's going?"

3025,Wha? Really? You should! It's fun.,"I love the people here. And if there was one thing I di... don't really care for is that they can be terribly, terribly ignorant about other cultures. And I don't want them embarrassing me in front of my girlfriend, Carol."
3026,Kelly?,Sparkles...
3027,How many gods do you have?,"Like hundreds, I think. Maybe more than that."
3028,[points at picture on the wall] And that blue busty gal? What's her story?,She looks like Pam from the neck down.
3029,"Just stop it. [slide of Michael & Carol kissing] What's the... oh, whoa! [laughs] Where did that come from?","Karen, my chips got stuck in the vending machine again. I need your skinny, little arms."
3030,Oh. Did you shake it?,"Yeah, I shook it, I shook it."
3031,Scuse me?,Roller-coastery friendship. Hot. Cold. On again. Off again. Sexual tension filled type of deal. It's very Sam and Diane.
3032,And another thing about the Indian people... they love sex positions. I present to you the Kama Sutra. I mean look at that. Who's seen that before?,I have. That's the 'Union of the Monkey'.
3033,And Karen? Let's keep it to twenty dollars a person this time.,Got it.
3034,You guys ready to party?,What's that?

3039,I'm a vegetarian. What can I eat?,It's all vegetarian.
3040,What? Too spicy?,No. These s'mores are disgusting.

3042,"All they are is chocolate, graham cracker, and marshmallow. How difficult would that have been?","So, you're Kelly's sisters, huh?"
3043,"So, you're Kelly's sisters, huh?",[laugh] Kelly Zach Braff [speaks in Hindi]
3044,What?,"Ruka, Nipa, Tiffany. Stop acting like such little losers and just be cool. Come on, Ryan. Come on. Leave him alone. I hate you guys."

Ah-hah... Hi. Sorry. I just have an announcement to make. Um... okay. I have learned a lot about Indian culture tonight. But I have learned even more about love. And I know you're all thinking 'who is this crazy gringo and what is he talking about?' Well, I'm not crazy. Maybe I'm crazy in love. So without further ado, Carol? Carol Stills.

Sorry. I just have an announcement to make. Um... okay. I have learned a lot about Indian culture tonight. But I have learned even more about love.

3070,How do I explain this to Jan?,"Um, well, basically, it's like a really big party, and everybody gets super-dressed up, and there's a bunch of different gods, and each of the gods has a special power, like the Care Bears, you know?"
3071,"Um, well, basically, it's like a really big party, and everybody gets super-dressed up, and there's a bunch of different gods, and each of the gods has a special power, like the Care Bears, you know?","Oh, please, stop talking. Three words or less."

3075,What is Diwali?,What is Diwali?
3076,What is Diwali?,Yes.
3077,"You don't know what Diwali is? Wow, Jan. I'm surprised. It's the Hindu festival of lights. I just assumed you'd be familiar with it. It's the most sacred and honored Hindu holiday in the world. It's like Christmas, Easter, and Halloween---",Mich---
3078,#NAME?,Oh.
3079,What? I'm not Muslim!,"Well, I think it sounds lovely. I think it sounds like a good idea."
3080,You do?,"Yes, of course. It's important to celebrate our company's rich diversity. And, and in fact, Michael, if you had planned better, we might have been able to charter a bus to the event---"
3081,#NAME?,"For Kelly, that seems a bit much."
3082,"I had promised Carol a romantic evening on the town. Um, I wanted to take her on this spooky hay ride thing, but it was like seventy dollars a person, and she's allergic to hay. So I said, 'Pop a Claritin, and I will spot you the seventy bucks,' and she's like 'I don't like to borrow money or take unnecessary medication.'  And I'm like, 'Well you're really not gonna like what I slipped in your drink last night.' And she's like, 'What the hell are you talking about?' And I'm like, 'I'm kidding. I didn't put a roof...' [cracks himself up] ... We laughed so hard... It was hilarious... oh... [calms down] So yes, I'm very excited about the Diwali party.","For Diwali 07, you must consider Scrantonicity.

3089,Who are you faxing so early in the morning?,"Oh, umm... kinda hard to explain."
3090,On whom's authority?,The board's.
3091,What?,"I'm very sorry. I don't relish telling you this. You've been a big part of this company, and the board asked me to thank you for your years of service."
3092,Am I a small number person or a severance package person?,"Well, we haven't made final decisions about personnel yet. But you're a severance package person."
3093,"Oh, you gotta be... Josh?",Our CFO believes that Josh is going to play an important role in our company's future.
3094,"Oh really, what role is that? King of the stupid universe?","It is an outrage, that's all. It's... hey're making a huge, huge mistake. Let's see Josh replace these people. Let's see Josh find another Stanley. You think Stanleys grow on trees? Well they don't. There is no Stanley tree. Do you think the world is crawling with Phyllises? Show me that farm. With Phyllises and Kevins sprouting up all over the place. Ripe for the plucking. Show me that farm."

Show me that farm.",Pictures. Memories. [Picks up a framed photo of Stanley's daughter from Stanley's desk] Look at that. They grow up so fast.
3096,"When you become close with someone, you develop a kind of sixth sense. You can read their moods like a book. And right now, the title of Michael's book is, 'Something Weird is Going On.'

3102,What can't you tell me?,"Nothing, Pam.[whispers to himself] What difference does it make?  We'll be gone in a couple of weeks anyway."

3109,"You knew about this all along, didn't you?",Jan told me just a few minutes before she told you.
3110,"What about us, Michael? Do we still have jobs?",I don't know. Probably not. This is the worst.
3111,What does that mean?,"Well, some of us are fired and a few are going to Connecticut."
3112,"I don't really want to work here without Pam. You know that Cinderella song, 'You Don't Know What You Got (Till It's Gone)'? That pretty much says it better than how I know how to say it... in words.",Hey Mike.
3113,What's the plan?,"Go to New York, confront the CFO, show him he's making a mistake... save the branch."
3114,Can I drive?,No... way.

3119,"I know it's not definite or whatever, but uh, do you know who's coming over here from Scranton?",I honestly don't. I don't know.
3120,"Okay, so is it like sales or... accountants?","You know what, Jim, I wouldn't worry about it."
3121,What does that mean?,Hi.
3122,"Oh, good. You're both here. Ready to talk logistics?","[to Kelly] I just feel like it could have been something special if we could have kept working together, but I'm gonna go someplace else and you're gonna go someplace else. It just doesn't make sense."
3123,"Okay, this is it. [runs up the stairs of CFO's house, with Dwight] This is exactly what Michael Moore does, famous documentarian. He goes up to people with a camera and he's like 'Why did you do this? Why did you pollute? You are bad. You're a bad person.' It's very dramatic.  Although, I can't say I was a big fan of  'Bowling for Columbine', because I thought it was going to be a bowling movie, like 'Kingpin'. And it wasn't. It was something else.","So, Josh will be running what is now called Dunder-Mifflin ,Northeast, which is all the offices north of Stamford. And Jim, fi you want the job, you'll be his number two."
3124,Wha... excuse... why not?,"As of today, I have accepted a senior managment position at Staples."

3130,Yes? What is the meaning of this?,Can you tell us why you are shutting down Scranton and putting 15 people out of work?
3131,Can you tell us why you are shutting down Scranton and putting 15 people out of work?,"Well, the branch is no longer finicially viable. It's simple dollars and cents."
3132,"Listen, Scott... we're losing money, okay? It's not a charity; it's a business. And it's a dying business.","[no longer talking to Dwight as Wallace] Stop... stop it! Just, okay. He's not going to say any of that."
3133,"[as himself] Whoa hey, why not?","Because he'd be intimidated and I, just... let's start again. Just be more scared of me, okay?"

Your branch is not closing; Stamford is closing. Um, for the time being, it seems that all your jobs are safe.",Yes!
3144,Is it because of Michael? Did he actually do something?,"Well, reasons are not important. Would you just call him, please? Wherever he is... and tell him."

3182,Yeah. Are you ready?,"No, my groin..."
3183,"Am I being mean to Dwight? I don't know. I did just make him run around the building and I have no intention of timing him. This isn't even a stopwatch. It's a digital thermometer.

3483,You what?,"I, I put a mark on her arm. [Both are laughing] So I could tell them apart. I don't... I know, I know. I can't believe I gave her my bike!"
3484,"Oh, why do I feel like crap?",You just had a rebound.
3485,I had rebound? Yeah.,"Yeah. Which, don't get me wrong, can be a really fun distraction, but, when it's over, you're left thinking about the girl you really like, the one that broke your heart."
3486,"[on phone] Yes, I just wanted to see if, uh you would like to come to Jamaica with me. There's this resort called Sandals. Really? OK. All right. I promise you won't be disappointed.

And a lot of people don't give Shakespeare enough credit. They think it was somebody else. A-holes."
3490,"When Michael suggested canceling Christmas, I was outraged, not on my behalf, but on behalf of baby Jesus. I mean, would he cancel Christmas because he got dumped or he was two weeks behind on his party planning, on top of the fact that his cats were ill? I think not. I think baby Jesus would suck it up and plan his party.","We didn't have a party planning committee in Stamford. Somebody would just volunteer to run out to Carvel and pick up an ice cream cake. So the fact that they have a committee here, fascinating."
3491,"This is ridiculous. I... I've spent so much time, like I always do. And for that little trollop to come in here and throw her own party... Are you even listening to me?","Angela, what do you want me to do?"

3498,Yeah. You know what? I am. I'm gonna call her. That's a good idea.,[from across the table] Where's Michael going? Michael? Is he sick? Is he choking?
3499,[from across the table] Where's Michael going? Michael? Is he sick? Is he choking?,"[on [phone] No, I don't think I'm asking too much. I think it's only fair that you tell me exactly what I did wrong. Okay. Uh huh. Well that... yeah. Uh huh. All right. Well, could you tell me something that I did"
3500,"Oh, thank you. Do you always get presents for your ex-girlfriends?","Okay, we're never technically... um is there.. Is there a problem?"
3501,"Okay, we're never technically... um is there.. Is there a problem?","Well, I didn't get you anything, because you have treated me inconsiderately, and I'm not gonna stand for that anymore."

3509,All of a sudden?,Uh huh. Hold me.
3510,"All right, let's get started. Umm... Oh, first off, we're supposed to be pushing cardstock this week. So... let's push cardstock this week. Uh, also... [to Dwight] what is this?",Tape recorder.
3511,For what?,For recording. Michael is on vacation and he's asked me to record all meetings and to type up the transcripts.
3512,"OK. Uh, Karen, any news from that law firm?","Yeah, the deal closed yesterday, it's the six month commitment."
3513,"Oh my God, Dwight, what're you doing?",What?
3514,What?,You're not allowed to take off your pants in the middle of the office.
3515,"No, let the record show that Dwight K. Schrute is now completely nude and is holding a plastic knife to Stanley's neck?!",[leans into tape recorder] Let the record show that Jim Halpert is a liar!
3516,"Dwight, what is that on your stomach? Is that a Muppet Babies tattoo?","Oh my God, Karen, you're right, that is Animal from the Muppet Babies."
3517,Hey. You have a bunch of messages and... [sees Michael shaking head with beads in hair] that's nice. Hannah quit while you were gone.

3524,"Yeah... Gosh. Great. You know what, Pam? Make a note. I want us all to start having pina coladas every day at three.","But you can't today, we're doing inventory."
3525,"Inventory is boring. In the islands, they don't make you do stuff like take inventory. Why do you think so many businesses move to the Caymans?","Tonight, we are going to have an inventory luau. I want to bring back a little slice of paradise to the Dunder Mifflin warehouse inventory. So, Party Planning Committee, get on it."
3526,By the end of the day? That's impossible.,The Jamaicans don't have a word for 'impossible.'

3643,Oh man. Talk about your classic 'Lame dash O.' Do we even want that guy buying our paper?,Yes.

4060,"Well, it's simple Mike. I mean we merged these two branches right?  So now we're shipping twice as many orders as we used to.  With Roy gone we got a smaller crew.  And I'm pickin' up all of his slack, so I think I should be compensated fairly, by gettin' a raise.",[mumbles jibberish]
4061,What?  I can't hear you.,[mumbling softly] That was a very good point.

But now, I want to be nice to him, and actually give him something, and he's like an eel.  I just can't grab onto him.  It's infuriating."

I have to stay within the parameters of my budget.  I can't shop at a fancy Norwegian boutique.  I buy my suits the old fashioned way.  I buy them from discount stores... or on eBay.  And when I found out that Ross was having a midnight madness sale, I ran, not walked, as per the instructions on the flier.  And I got there, and when the doors opened, all of these women ran to this one bin.  And I did too.  And I grabbed this suit.  And a woman, sort of a, I don't know, Missy Elliot type, grabbed the jacket.  And, uh, we had kind of a heated tug of war.  And I could tell by the way she was screaming that this must be a get.  And I figured she was just buying it for her husband, to answer your question from before.  Um, anyway, she s... socked me, in the eye.  And she got it, she got the suit.

4141,"You may be asking yourself, 'What am I doing on a trampoline?'  Well, I thought I'd bounce here for a while, relieve some stress, and then move on with my day.  Not!  Here's the plan.  Dwight, is going to gather all of the office workers and all of the warehouse guys, we're going to have another safety seminar.  Only this time, where's Michael?  Oh my God!  He is on the roof!  Now I have got their attention.  I... tell them, about the cold hard facts of depression.  And then I say, 'Hey!  You ever seen a suicide?'  And I jump.  And they freak out.  And they get to see... the dangers of depression with their own eyes.  Nice side note: They might think 'Hey, I should have been nicer to Michael.'  But that's... not why I'm doing this... Then, I land on the trampoline, take a couple extra bounces for fun.  I climb off, walk around the corner... Ta-freakin'-da!  [Dwight nods]","So then the next movie moves to the top of the queue.  So number five becomes number four, number six becomes number five, [Ryan checks his watch]number three becomes number two, etc, etc.  And let's just say that I just sent back"

4318,"What are...? Shut it. Shut. Up. OK, so what I want to engage us in today is a hardcore discussion about women's problems and issues and situations. Magazines and TV shows and movies portray women as skinny, tall goddesses. Well, look around. Are women like that? No. No, they are not. [points to Pam] Even the hot ones aren't really that skinny. So what does that say? That says that you women are up against it. And it is criminal. Society doesn't care. Society sucks. I don't even consider myself a part of society. FYI.

4350,"[sighs] Any man who says he totally understands women is a fool. Because they are un-understandable. There's a wishing fountain at the mall. And I threw a coin in for every woman in the world and made a wish. I wished for Jan to get over me. I wished for Phyllis, a plasma TV. I wished for Pam to gain courage. I wished for Angela, a heart, and for Kelly, a brain. 'Michael, how can you appreciate women so much but also dump one of them?'

4362,"Borscht, according to Dwight it's best served cold.  You know what else is best served cold?  Yeah, gazpacho.  You see what I'm doing?  I am establishing a mutual love of cold soups.  This is the first step in my plan to win Dwight's trust.",I should make you my vichyssoise.

4395,"Jim Halpert. Pros: smart, cool, good-looking. Remind you of anybody you know? Cons: not a hard worker. I can spend all day on a project, and he will finish the same project in a half an hour. So that should tell you something.",I choose Michael!
4396,We are going to choose team names. Dwight?,We will be called Gryffindor.
4397,Really? Not Slytherin?,"Slytherin are the bad guys, Jim."

Michael, you couldn't even do that.  Maybe I should be your boss? Wow, I feel really good right now.  Why didn't any of you come to my art show? I invited all of you.  That really sucked. It's like sometimes some of you act like I don't even exist.  [turns and looks directly at Jim] Jim, I called off my wedding because of you. And now we're not even friends.  And things are just like weird between us, and that sucks. And I miss you. You were my best friend before you went to Stamford, and I really miss you. I shouldn't have been with Roy.

It's... whatever. That's not what... I'm not... Okay, my feet really hurt. The thing that I'm just trying to say to you, Jim... and to everyone else in this circle I guess, is that I miss having fun with you. Just you, not everyone in the circle.

4454,Are you not gonna put out the torches?,Set!
4455,"[sighs] Okay. Pam, who came out best in the race, in your opinion?","Um, Karen left her blindfold on the longest but she also threw her egg at Jim."

4489,Do you think it's gonna to be weird working with Jan in New York?,"No. Not at all. I haven't talked to Jan since we broke up, and I think if she had something to say she would have called me."
4490,Maybe you should talk to her? Before...,"No, no, no. You know what? It's a done deal. I basically have the job already. There's nothing she can do to stop it now. I already sold my condo."

4529,"Well, I um, I have to get back, but I will see you in New York tomorrow, right?","Yes, indeed."
4530,What happened?,"Your advice was good, but Jan's was bigger."
4531,So we have all night.  Where do you want to go first?,"Oh, I dunno, how about the U.N.?"

4547,Do you accept?,"Absolutely, I do."
4548,"Oh, great.  I've been meaning to thank you by the way.  You didn't lose a single customer during the merger, and you still managed to trim the budget?  That is nice work. [Michael smiles] So, let me ask you a question right off the bat.  What do you think are your greatest strengths as a manager?",Why don't I tell you what my greatest weaknesses are?  I work too hard.  I care too much.  And sometimes I can be too invested in my job.

4555,What do you think we could be doing better?,"I've never been a big fan of the name Dunder Mifflin.  I was thinking we could name the company something like, 'Paper Great.  Where great paper is our passion.  We're GRRRRRRRRRREAT!'  I don't know, could be good.  Or, uh, 'Super Duper Paper.  It's super duper.'  I don't know, something like that."
4556,"I don't understand. So, we're gonna tag team it?","No, we're letting Jan go."
4557,Trees!  And where do trees grow?,[at the same time as Dwight] Forest.
4558,"Soil. Right.  We have, in front of you here, seven different types of Pennsylvania top soil.

4559,We--- Don't you wanna earn Schrute Bucks?,"No.  In fact, I'll give you a billion Stanley Nickels if you never talk to me again."
4560,What's the ratio of Stanley Nickels to Schrute Bucks?,The same as the ratio of unicorns to leprechauns.
4561,"No wait, what are you doing?!",I'm punishing them.
4562,What--- What are you winking for?,Zip your lid!
4563,"So, that's... my basic 5 year plan.  And after that, who knows?","Okay.  Uh, now, this may seem like an odd question, but..."

4566,How was your interview?,Pretty good.
4567,Yeah?,Could have gone better I guess.
4568,What?,"Daaah, let's just run away together.  Let's just run away to Jamaica and live in a bungalow.  You have some savings right?  You could pay off my debts.  It would... be fine.  We'd have fun."
4569,"Daaah, let's just run away together.  Let's just run away to Jamaica and live in a bungalow.  You have some savings right?  You could pay off my debts.  It would... be fine.  We'd have fun.",What's... what's the matter?  What... what happened in there?
4570,What's... what's the matter?  What... what happened in there?,I can't tell you.
4571,Tell me what?,You son of a bitch!
4572,Erratic?,"Recently, you don't even show an interest in your work!  You smoke constantly in your office.  You spend most of the day online shopping.  You disappear for hours at a time, sometimes days.  Always saying you're visiting your sister in Scottsdale.  You go to Scranton far more often than you used to---"
4573,[opens up her overcoat] Is it because of these?,"Wuuuoooh, hey, whoa, Jan---"
4574,No?,It's not.
4575,"Cause he likes them. [points to Michael] Okay? He likes them. And, and that is, that is all I care about.",The time has come for you to end your professional relationship with this company.  You are clearly unstable.
4576,"Okay, you know what?  I'm just not leaving.  I'm not leaving.  Not leaving.","David, I did not tell her."
4577,"Don't let them change you, okay? [Jan drops several items, Michael and Hunter help pick them up, she starts to walk out the door] So long, [censored].","So, I am gonna... give her a ride home.  Let me know about the job."
4578,"You know what?  That... is actually good... because, um, I don't think I could take... my girlfriend's job.  That's not being a good boyfriend.  So, I respectfully withdraw my name from consideration.  Do you accept my withdrawal?",I do.
4579,"Oh, man.  You know what?  This might take a while.  You really don't have to stay, if you don't want.","Okay, good!  Because, um, a bunch of my friends are meeting downtown for lunch.  And, I was gonna meet them, so..."
4580,"Oh, just... No, actually I think it's good, you know?  It's fine, actually, I do.  I really think it's great that it happened.  Because, you know, my work has always been the thing that has gotten in the way of my happiness, so... [laughs]","Well, it's... [Jan starts crying, high pitched whining] No, don't cry, it's gonna be OK."
4581,"[sobbing] Oh, I know, I know.  It's just... I'm sorry.  It's just these painkillers that I started taking since the surgery.  Ohhh!  They make my moods totally unpredictable!  Wow!  What am I gonna do?",[whispers] I don't know.  [normal volume] Well I guess... you could come and stay at my condo.  I think I could back out of the sale. [Jan exhales] Probably get some negative feedback on my eBay profile.
4582,How'd it go?,"No.  No, Pam.  I'm baaaaaack!  For gooood!  Kevin Nealon."
4583,"Everybody, may I have your attention please?  It is with great honor and privilege that I announce to you that I have officially withdrawn my name for consideration from the corporate job.  I know, I know, I know.  'Michael, what are you thinking?  You were a shoe in.'  Well, got down there.  I nailed the interview.  And the strangest thing happened.  Why is my office black?",To intimidate my subordinates.
4584,Did... Karen get the job?,[to everyone] Back to work. [to Ryan] Still waitin' on that coffee.
4585,"I'm sorry, wait, so is the question 'How'd I get to be so awesome?' [laughs] Because, I don't have an answer for you. [laughs]","Uh, oh, hey, do you have your quarterly numbers?"
4586,"Uh, oh, hey, do you have your quarterly numbers?","Yes, absolutely."
4587,How do you think you function here in New York?,"[not thinking clearly because of Pam's note] What's that? Oh, uh, great.  You know?  I just um, I really appreciate the buildings, and uh, the people, and um, there's just a [sic] energy... New York has, uh...  Not to mention, they have places that are open past eight.  [David laughs] So that's a... bonus."
4588,"[not thinking clearly because of Pam's note] What's that? Oh, uh, great.  You know?  I just um, I really appreciate the buildings, and uh, the people, and um, there's just a [sic] energy... New York has, uh...  Not to mention, they have places that are open past eight.  [David laughs] So that's a... bonus.",You've been in the Scranton branch a long time. [Jim stares at Pam's note] What have you liked most about that place?
4589,You've been in the Scranton branch a long time. [Jim stares at Pam's note] What have you liked most about that place?,[thinks] The friendships.
4590,"Okay.  Well, we want the person who takes this position to be here for the long haul.  So... long haul.  Where do you see yourself in ten years?",[flashback to Beach Games] How are your feet?
4591,[flashback to Beach Games] How are your feet?,Medium rare.  Thanks. [they laugh]
4592,"I haven't heard anything, but I bet Jim got the job.  I mean, why wouldn't he?  He's totally qualified, and smart, everyone loves him... and, if he never comes back again... that's OK.  We're friends.  And I'm sure we'll stay friends.  We just, we never got the timing right.  You know?  I shot him down, and then he did the same to me, and...  But you know what?  It's OK.  I'm totally fine.  Everything is gonna be totally--- [Jim walks in]","Pam.  [to camera] Sorry. [to Pam] Um, are you free for dinner tonight?"
4593,"Pam.  [to camera] Sorry. [to Pam] Um, are you free for dinner tonight?",Yes.
4594,"[to camera, tearing up, smiling] I'm sorry, what was the question?","[on phone] So, I know we left the other day on a note of uncertainty.  But, after some more thought, I'm very pleased to be able to offer you this job.  [laughs] Great!  I'm so glad.  We're all very excited you're going to be joining us.  It'll be nice to have another MBA around here."
4595,Who was that?,[still smiling] Nobody.  You and I are done.
4596,What?! [Ryan smiles and glances at the camera],Where do you see yourself in ten years?
4597,Where do you see yourself in ten years?,"Well, [clears throat] I've actually done a lot of thinking about that.  And in ten years, I am living in a big house, with my kids.  And in this house we have screens on the walls that have famous art on them and I have a remote that works everything, that has like a belt-loop attachment, or in my ear, like a gluetooth.  And, because it's the future, I can take just a little tiny pill and get all my vitamins for the whole day."
4598,A... multivitamin?,"Well, I don't know what it's gonna be called, but... my point is, the future of this company is now.  And the future... is me."
4599,"Michael, what happened?","Jan got fired.  And I realized that I could not work for a company that would fire my girlfriend.   But more than that, I realized that... I couldn't take a job that would take me away from this place.  This is where I belong.  This is... my home.  And home is where the hardest."
4600,Heart is.  That makes a lot more sense.  You think they'd help each other out like that at corporate? [Oscar shrugs] I think not!,"Well, if Michael gets the job, I will be so upset, because Dwight used to have a crush on me, so if he's boss, it'll be really awkward."
4601,Nyah ah! Too long!  What is the Dharma Initiative?,It is the source of all energy on this planet.
4602,"I'm a very good interviewee.  Why?  Because I have something that nobody else has.  And that is... my brain.  Which makes me charming, witty, intelligent... [long pause] and quick on my feet.",Who was the second man on the moon?
4603,Who was the second man on the moon?,Trick question.  There was no second man on the moon.
4604,When is the Paleolithic Age?,17 B.C.
4605,What is a scented candle?,How is the new boss?  Tough.  Do people respect him?  They have to.  Do they like him?  Irrelevant.  They do not.  And I hate them back.
4606,How is the new boss?  Tough.  Do people respect him?  They have to.  Do they like him?  Irrelevant.  They do not.  And I hate them back.,"New York real estate.  I started by looking for a brownstone, like the Huxtables had, [shakes head] but instead I found this very, very, nice place in Jamaica, Queens, mon.  It is on the last stop of the subway, which is wonderful, because if I fall asleep, I still end up at home.  It is a suh-weeeet one bedroom.  I have a roommate, uh, Vijay Chokalingham, he's a sophomore at Queens College.  He actually works in the Indian restaurant right below the apartment, so... free food, and the place always smells like curry.  So, win/win."
4607,You know generally it's not a good idea to click on offers that you haven't requested. What was the exact offer?,It was for a video.
4608,"Yeah, what kind of video?",A celebrity sex tape.
4609,"Really, what kind of celebrity?",Not relevant.
4610,How much did you pay for it?,Not relevant.
4611,You paid for it?,It all happened so fast.
4612,"Are you kidding me, Pam and Jim are totally hooking up. All they do is smile; they're just keeping it a secret. Right? [looks at Oscar]","I don't know, there is no evidence of intimacy. They've been in remarkably good moods. It could be other things."
4613,Are you kidding me?,And Sunday I'm thinking of going to that flea-market at the drive-in.
4614,What?,Where?
4615,Where?,"It happened this morning in the parking lot. I took her to the hospital, and the doctors tried to save her life. They did the best that they could... And she is going to be OK."
4616,What is wrong with you? Why did you have to phrase it like that?,So she's really going to be fine?
4617,So she's really going to be fine?,"Yes. She has a slight pelvical fracture, but, ah... people have survived far worse."
4618,Did you see who did it?,No need we can just check the security tapes.
4619,Who was driving?,"Oh, Michael."
4620,"Yeah, it's only Meredith, thank God. But did you see the way they looked at me? Like I was a murderer or something.",Hey... Why did you do it?
4621,Hey... Why did you do it?,It was an accident.
4622,Was she talkin' back?,No.
4623,Did you get sick of that face? Did she owe you money? Uh-oh. Is this downsizing? Did she spurn your advances?,"Hey guys, we're all gonna visit Meredith at lunch. And we're kicking in $5 for flowers."
4624,"Who's we, you and Jim?","No, uh, me Stanley and Phyllis so far."
4625,"Oh, I bet you ask?",I was planning on it.
4626,Angela?,[whispers to Kevin] Subtle.
4627,[to Angela] Are you coming?,"I can't, Sprinkles is sick."
4628,"I have to give her her meds, I have to pet her, and who will she eat lunch with?",Can't your other cats keep her company.
4629,Yes Michael?,"So Ryan got promoted to corporate, where he is a little fish in a big pond. Whereas back here in Scranton I am still top dog, in a fairly large pond. So who is the real boss? The dog or a fish?"
4630,"So Ryan got promoted to corporate, where he is a little fish in a big pond. Whereas back here in Scranton I am still top dog, in a fairly large pond. So who is the real boss? The dog or a fish?",So I need a little treat for the gang. Something to win their affections back.
4631,Back? Why is that Michael?,"Well, I ran down Meredith in my car."
4632,Oh! Did you do this on purpose?,"No, I was being negligent. But she's in the hospital, she's fine, recovering nicely. Tiny little crack in her pelvis. But she will be up in..."
4633,Did this happen on company property?,"Yes. It was on company property, with company property, so... double jeopardy, we are fine."
4634,"Oh, right, I'm sorry. What is: we are fine?",[sigh]
4635,"Hey monkey, what's up?",Can you do me a little favor? Go to my place at lunch and give Sprinkles her medicine.
4636,Can you do me a little favor? Go to my place at lunch and give Sprinkles her medicine.,Sure.
4637,So what do you need me to do?,I wrote it out.
4638,You pushed Darryl out the window?,No.
4639,You shot Dwight?,"No! That is not funny, I love my employees, even thought I hit one of you with my car. For which I take full responsibility. Look I'm just trying to take everybody's mind off of this unavoidable tragedy, and onto more positive things. So I thought we should plant a tree."
4640,"Yaaaaaay, Pam! Alright, since I am the boss I will drive as well. Who wants shotgun?",You can't be serious. You ran a woman over this morning.
4641,"Guess what, I have flaws. What are they? Oh, I don't know. I sing in the shower. Sometimes I spend too much time volunteering. Occasionally I'll hit somebody with my car. So sue me... No, don't sue me. That is the opposite of the point that I'm trying to make.",Eww. I hate hospitals. In my mind they are associated with sickness. Oh... She looks like an angel.
4642,"What, what are you doing? Just gimme that.",Thanks.
4643,Does it hurt terribly?,"No, it's not too bad. They have me on a lot of painkillers."
4644,"Oh really, what kind? Codeine, Vicodin, Percocet, Fentanyl, Oxycontin, Palladone? What...",I have no idea.
4645,"Oh, OK... Wait up, wait up, guys guys guys, hold on a second. You know what I was thinking might be sort of fun? Is if you forgave me in front of everybody.","Michael, I'm not gonna do that."
4646,Cause you know what they say in the Bible about forgiveness? Forgiveness is next to Godliness.,"No, that's not. That's next to cleanliness."
4647,Do I need to be liked? Absolutely not. I like to be liked. I enjoy being liked. I have to be liked. But it's not like a compulsive need to be liked. Like my need to be praised.,Hey.
4648,Any problems?,"Well you left the TV on, and your cat is dead."
4649,What!?,"Sparkles, the white one, is dead."
4650,"That was the sick one, right?",Uh-huh. But I thought she had more time.
4651,Did she look... When you saw her how was she looking?,Really dead. Like a... just a dead cat.
4652,"OK, you know what? Everybody, let's just get over the whole Meredith thing. She cracked her pelvis, a tiny little crack. She going to be fine, so let's just...","Michael, Angela's cat died."
4653,Sprinkles?,[nods]
4654,"[sighs] Oh, sh... I'm sorry Angela. Man what a day huh? How could it get any worse? Her computer crashes with the porn, and then Meredith with the accident, and then... Sprinkles! God, that's 3 things. I'll tell you what's going on. This office is cursed, and we need to do something about it.","Well, I am taking responsibility. It is up to me to get rid of the curse that hit Meredith with my car. I'm not superstitious, but... I'm... I am a little-stitious."
4655,Did anyone do anything involving an Indian burial ground?,Like what?
4656,Like what?,Like park on it. Or dig up a body... Toby? Anything you want to tell us?
4657,Like park on it. Or dig up a body... Toby? Anything you want to tell us?,"No, I did not violate an Indian burial ground. In fact I had some good luck recently, Alfredo's Pizza, picked my business card out of the basket, so... uh, I got a week of free pies."
4658,Sprinkles never hurt a soul. God in your infinite wisdom how could you do this? She wasn't ready. She had so much left to accomplish.,She's only a cat.
4659,"Dwight, you haven't seen Meredith yet, have you?","No, I have not."
4660,Oh?,[puts hand up for high five] Same religion.
4661,Are you sure?,No.
4662,What are you?,"Well if you're going to reduce my identity to my religion then I'm Sikh, but I also like Hip-hop and NPR, and I'm restoring a 1967 Corvette in my spare time."
4663,How are you doing Ms. Palmer?,Better.
4664,"Are you a doctor, or a male nurse?","Um... I'm an intern, which makes me a doctor, but..."
4665,"Ah, so uh... so that is where her uterus went... Um, Ms. Palmer, your last tetanus shot was when you were bitten by a bat a few months ago?","Yes. Dwight here, trapped it in a bag against my head."
4666,It also says you were recently bitten by a raccoon?,And a rat. Separate occasions.
4667,"Maybe believing in God was the mistake. What did people believe in before? The sun? Maybe there's some sort of animal, that we could make a sacrifice too. Like a giant buffalo, or some sort of monster, like something with the body of a walrus with the head of a sea lion. Or something with the body of an egret with the head of a meerkat. Or just... the head of a monkey, with the antlers of a reindeer, with, ah... the body of a porcupine.",I will do some research.
4668,"Oh God, Rabies?",Mm-hmm.
4669,"I was in the hospital room with her. How contagious is that, is that like an STD?","No, no. You've gotta be bitten by something."
4670,"Is there a God? If not, what are all the churches for? And who is Jesus' dad?","[Pam walks out of the office into the parking lot alone. Kevin pops up from the back seat of his car as if spying] Oh well, if they aren't together now, then they probably never will be. I thought they'd be good together, like PB&J. Pam Beasley and Jim. What a waste. What - A - Waste!"
4671,"[on the phone] No, rabies... Babies would be a good idea. Can I put you down for a dime?","Hi Stanley, how many sponsors so far?"
4672,"Hi Stanley, how many sponsors so far?",Zero.
4673,Isn't that your money?,"That... is for a good cause. Phyllis, how's the rabies quilt coming?"
4674,"That... is for a good cause. Phyllis, how's the rabies quilt coming?","Oh, it's coming."
4675,Michael?,Yes.
4676,What's wrong?,"I have this crazy thought, that I know is crazy. That maybe Dwight killed my cat."
4677,Did Roy ever kill one of your cats?,I'm more of a dog person.
4678,So what's your strategy for this race?,Well I'm gonna start fast.
4679,What?,Then I'm gonna end fast.
4680,Why won't more people do that? [laughs],Cause they're just stupid.
4681,[looks at camera] What?,"[Pam and Jim watch video of their kiss on the tv] Oh, ah... No that's not... I mean that wasn't, ah..."
4682,"I mean I can see how it would seem a bit like we uh... How it looks like um... I mean now a days you can edit anything, right? I mean you can edit anything to look like um... anything.","Yeah, I gave him a ride home because..."
4683,"Ah, yeah. We haven't told anybody, but it's going really great. [looks at Jim] Right?",It is going really great.
4684,"Oh, really?",[sighs] You'll feel better after the 5k. Exercise is good for depression.
4685,"We have raised, almost $700.00, most of it from me and Jan. Um... when do they put that on the giant check? Or is that something that we write in later?","Well a giant check costs about $200.00 to make up. I have a print shop standing by but... What do you think Michael, that's over 25% of our funds?"
4686,"Well a giant check costs about $200.00 to make up. I have a print shop standing by but... What do you think Michael, that's over 25% of our funds?",Hmm... That's a tough decision. Um... I always imagined it with a giant check. So...
4687,You didn't contribute very much. I was also hoping to hand the giant check to a rabies doctor. And how's that been going?,"Not well. A doctor won't come out to collect a check for $700.00, or $500.00 if we go with the giant check."
4688,What about a rabies nurse?,I don't think so.
4689,Have you met that kid? He's not going to college.,"Michael, 5k means 5 kilometers, not 5 thousand miles. [knocks]"
4690,What are you doing?,You said come in!
4691,May I enter the room?,Yes. Or come in.
4692,You couldn't have taken off all your clothes in the men's room?,"Yes, but I have an office, so why would I do that."
4693,"On average, how many hours a day do you spend naked in your office? Just ballpark.",European offices are naked all the time.
4694,"That's not gross, it is the human body. What is your problem? Pam you're an artist, right? Think of me as one of your models. OK, you know what, I don't want this to detract from what we really need to be thinking about today, it's not fair to people with rabies. And that's the point, right? OK, let's go have some fun.",Alright.
4695,"[naked from chest up] Oh, I'm sorry, is this a working office, and not a French beach?","OK, name please."
4696,You're over 75 years old?,82 November first. How much is the prize money?
4697,82 November first. How much is the prize money?,There's no prize money.
4698,"What, is any of this real?","Check that out. [points to Toby] Look at me, I'm Toby, I'm stretching, I know what I'm doing. Why is he even here?"
4699,"Check that out. [points to Toby] Look at me, I'm Toby, I'm stretching, I know what I'm doing. Why is he even here?",So I heard that you were peeping on Michael.
4700,"What? Look, no it was not...","I don't know what your deal is, but he's mine, OK? So hands off."
4701,"I don't know what your deal is, but he's mine, OK? So hands off.","OK everybody, listen up. Thank you for coming. Before we get started I wanted to say a few words about this deadly disease called rabies. And I'd like you to take a look into the face of rabies. [turns around a picture of Meredith in the hospital] That should scare you. It scares me. You people need to educate yourselves. Myth: 3 Americans every year die from rabies. Fact: 4 Americans every year die from rabies. How many of you know someone who has been afflicted or affected by rabies? Show of hands. One, two, three... too many to count. It is truly the silent killer. No, it is the foaming barking killer. And it is something... Darryl what are you doing."

Darryl what are you doing.",[feeding a squirrel] I'm giving him a peanut.
4703,"No, don't give him... just, did you hear anything I said?",Look how happy he is.
4704,"He's happy because he's insane. You know what, that's the perfect example of the kind of awareness we need to generate. Where's the nurse? [Elizabeth walks up in nurse's outfit] This is the reason we're here.",Hello Michael.
4705,"Oh hey, I know you... Elizabeth?",Yeah.
4706,"Right? Wow, very cool you went back and got your degree. I would like you to accept this check, for $340.00 made out to science. Make sure that, that gets into the right hands.",Great. [everyone claps]
4707,You got it?,Mm-hmm.
4708,"Water? Water? [Toby gabs water, drinks, then throws back at Jan] Water babe?","No, no water for me. Not while rabies causes fear of water... solidarity!"
4709,"[Creed, Stanley, and Oscar sitting at a table] Can we get another round?",OK.
4710,"So we've got what, another 20 minutes?",More or less.
4711,"[laughs] Excellent! ...Simpsons. Wait, Imodium or Ex-lax?","I'm makin' great time. Usually I have to take a bathroom break half way through a race like this, but not today."
4712,Ooo! An estate sale. Wanna go in?,I don't know I'm really committed to winning.
4713,"How ya feeling, better?",No.
4714,What does that mean?,"OK, when a farmer sees an animal that is in pain, that has no quality of life, that has no utility, a farmer does what city folk don't have the stomach to do."
4715,You did kill her!?,"I... I sang her, her favorite songs."
4716,It's fine. What?,How could you do that without telling me?
4717,How could you do that without telling me?,"I thought I was helping you. I expected a hug. I took care of that cat, the best way I knew how."
4718,"Or we can have her buried out at the east field, by mother. Huh, Angela?",Don't touch me Dwight! [runs off crying]
4719,"[holding lamp] You like it? It's kinda designy and cool, it was $8.00.","Oh, and I get to carry it."
4720,Where are we?,"I dunno, like 5 kilometers from the office."
4721,He couldn't have made it a circle?,"[bent over] I am not going to finish. I can't beat rabies. Nobody can beat rabies, rabies has been around for a thousand years. I was a fool to think that I could beat it. [Creed,Stanley, and Oscar pass by in the cab and get out at the finish line]"
4722,"Yeah probably. Hey, Michael?","What are you doing here? Did you come back for us, or..."
4723,"What are you doing here? Did you come back for us, or...","I can't finish. I feel so weak, I just..."
4724,What do you want me to do Jim?,Glass of water would be a start.
4725,You are?,"Yeah. Hey Michael, look at this lamp. $8.00."
4726,Hey Mer. How ya doing?,Better.
4727,"It's ironic isn't it? I mean I'm in the hospital for not getting enough water, and you're in it for a disease that causes the fear of water.","I'm in because you hit me with your car. But I wanted to say, I heard you were trying really hard, so I'm not mad at you anymore."
4728,"Thanks, I'm not mad at you anymore. [sighs, takes sucker out of his mouth] Wanna share?",Sure.
4729,Did you ever think of this?  Would a sober person walk in front of a car?,Ay-o!
4730,"I'm sorry, are you saying that Meredith was drunk at 9 AM?",Well...
4731,Drunk?  No!  You can't get drunk off Kahlua.  It's just a kind of coffee.,Then... what are you saying?
4732,Then... what are you saying?,I am saying... that... maybe I was drunk.  Did you ever think of that?
4733,I am saying... that... maybe I was drunk.  Did you ever think of that?,Definitely not.
4734,Maybe she hit me.  You ever think of that?  She hit me?  I don't know whose fault it was.  I wasn't exactly looking at the road.,"Hey, Toby. [walks past him to Kelly's cubicle]"
4735,"Kelly, we're going to visit Meredith at lunch.  [Kelly's lying down on floor, head unseen under desk.  She rolls to her side, away from Pam]  Kelly?","Well, Kelly's been so upset about Ryan dumping her, that she can't even talk. [grins]"
4736,"You know what, why don't go around the room and say one memory of Meredith.  I'll start.  I liked her jumpers.  They reminded me of Kindergarten.  Jim?","I'll always remember Meredith's back.  That's all I can see from my desk.  All that red hair, over a nice strong back.  Sometimes I pretend it's Carrot Top, and he's going to turn around and tell a joke."
4737,"So, how's the view old girl?  [looking out windows]  Oh!  There's a cemetery.  You think that's affiliated with the hospital, or is it a like a separate feature...","Hey! Okay, okay, okay,    You can just close that."
4738,"Let's just... Why can't you just forgive... Why, why are you having such a hard time laughing this off?  How do you know that you weren't born with some sort of abnormal pelvis that it was just bound to crack at some point?","Oh please, Michael."
4739,Conference room?,"Maybe the conference room, maybe the annex.  I'm just saying, at least right here [indicates floor in front of his office] is cursed.  Conference room, 10 minutes."
4740,Question: Has anyone recently offended a Gypsy?,We have to have done something wrong.
4741,"Oscar, are you Santaria?","I was raised Catholic, but I'm agnostic now, so I guess I'm a secular humanist."
4742,"Michael, do you know what secular humanism is?",Yes.  It is a philosophy which says people can improve their lives by using reason instead of religion or superstition.
4743,"My cousin Mose's best friend was a dog.  One day, he was foaming at the mouth, so I had to shoot him dead.  Turns out, he had only eaten one of Mose's cream pies.  Did I feel bad for killing him?  No.  That's how you deal with a thief.","Yeah, the, uh, the charity's having some financial problems.  What do I look like to you, Paul Newman?  That's actually not a good example, because I have been compared to a young Paul Newman, my eyes and my face.  And I make my own salad dressing.  I mix Newman's Ranch with Newman's Italian.  Sell it at flea markets for a slight loss.  I could make... I could make a profit if I changed one of the ingredients to Wishbone [shakes head] but I won't do it."
4744,"Yeah, the, uh, the charity's having some financial problems.  What do I look like to you, Paul Newman?  That's actually not a good example, because I have been compared to a young Paul Newman, my eyes and my face.  And I make my own salad dressing.  I mix Newman's Ranch with Newman's Italian.  Sell it at flea markets for a slight loss.  I could make... I could make a profit if I changed one of the ingredients to Wishbone [shakes head] but I won't do it.","Whoa, 'scuse me!  Oh!"
4745,"Hey, doc?  You forgetting something? [pediatrician takes a lollypop from his pocket and gives it to Michael]  Thank you.",Hey.
4746,"I'm just gonna grab some chips, you want some?","No. Thanks... uh we're still having lunch today, right?"
4747,"No. Thanks... uh we're still having lunch today, right?","I guess. [Pam smiles and walks away, then comes back and kisses Jim on the cheek] How dare you."
4748,Hey Toby. What's this? [holds up memo Toby has passed out to the staff],Ohh.
4749,"Is this about me and Jan? In my office? Because I will have you know that that was consensual. What we did has nothing to do with you or anyone here. I don't think. I don't think anyone heard anything. We were very discreet and, and most people had left by that point. So I don't think it's any of your business. What I think you should do is roll up the memo, real tight...","Ok, look the memo is not about you..."
4750,What?,You guys are together?
4751,You guys are together?,"Ummm... yup. Yes, we are."
4752,"Toby, was this your fun little way of congratulating us?",Yes.
4753,Jim Halpert's off the market. Guess who just became the best looking single guy in the office?,Hey. Can you make that straighter? That's what she said.
4754,Hey. Can you make that straighter? That's what she said.,Did you plan it?
4755,Did you plan it?,"No. [tries to hide piece of paper, but Pam grabs it]"
4756,[reading from paper] Can you make that straighter? That job looks hard. You should put your mouth on that. How can you even use that one naturally?,Blowing up balloons I thought.
4757,"[reading sign] Oh, is... Ryan coming back today?","Yeah, he is."
4758,What do you want?,To give you this [reveals a cat from under a coat].
4759,"Oh, what is that?",It's a feral barn cat. I trapped him last night and I'm giving him to you as a replacement cat for the one I destroyed.
4760,And his name is... Garbage. Mose calls him Garbage because he likes to eat garbage. [shakes cat] Don't you Garbage? [makes chomping noises],I can't believe you just thought you could replace Sprinkles. Before she's even in the ground.
4761,You haven't buried her yet?,Don't rush me. I'm grieving.
4762,"Sorry, uh do we need to sign one, or...?",Let's just wait and see what happens. [whispers] You know?
4763,Let's just wait and see what happens. [whispers] You know?,What?
4764,What?,Let's just wait.
4765,Hold on one second. [Ryan types on Blackberry for a few seconds] Hey Pam! It's great to see you. Is Michael in?,Hey!
4766,OK. Should we get started?,"Ohh, yeah, let's get started because uh, yes, cause uh this is very serious business and umm.."
4767,Here for what?,When he started the fire.
4768,Enough! OK? This is inappropriate  and it stops right now. Do you understand?,"Yes, everybody, come on. Settle town. Let's get serious here. Um Ryan, has a very special, important presentation to do, which we will be doing in the conference room in [looks at Ryan] 10 minutes?"
4769,"Yes, everybody, come on. Settle town. Let's get serious here. Um Ryan, has a very special, important presentation to do, which we will be doing in the conference room in [looks at Ryan] 10 minutes?",Perfect.
4770,I'll stick around to help you set them up afterwards. Any questions? Dwight?,What if we don't want to use a Blackberry because they are stupid and pointless?
4771,What if we don't want to use a Blackberry because they are stupid and pointless?,"This is company-wide, Dwight."
4772,"We should call it Dunder Mifflinfinity. You know, push the words together?",Any other questions? [Kelly's hand goes up] Kelly Kapoor.
4773,Any other questions? [Kelly's hand goes up] Kelly Kapoor.,Can we speak privately about our relationship?
4774,Can we speak privately about our relationship?,Thank you everybody.
4775,That's some fun stuff. When does the website go up?,"As fast as possible. We want to start retraining people A.S.A.P., so we can hit the ground running with a new system."
4776,Who is?,Us? You and me. The old timers.
4777,Us? You and me. The old timers.,I am not old. You are old. You are like a hundred.
4778,"You're over 40, that's the cut off. Are you listening to what he's saying? Re-training. New system. Youth. I'm telling you this kid is the grim reaper. You deal with this or you, me, Sammy, Phyllis, the chick you hit with the car, we're goners.","Swore I wouldn't tell anyone this, but in the interest of revealing secrets. Oh my God, this will make your brain explode. Umm, Dwight and Angela dating. Have been for six months."
4779,Wait. What? [Pam nods her head] You knew? And you didn't say anything?,You didn't say anything to me?
4780,You didn't say anything to me?,Fair enough. Wow! We should have started dating like a long time ago.
4781,"I couldn't see your hands. [Jim shakes his hands] Hey Pam, by the way, it's great that you're dating. But when a new client calls, you just have to randomly assign them to a sales person. You can't base who gets new clients on who you're sleeping with that week, OK?",OK.
4782,"OK, what's up?","Yeah, kay. I was just... After the presentation, just wanted to make sure, that vis-a-vie, that everything in the office is business as usual?"
4783,"Yeah, kay. I was just... After the presentation, just wanted to make sure, that vis-a-vie, that everything in the office is business as usual?","Well it is business, but not as usual."
4784,"Yeah, I know I understand... we're making great strides and we're updating, but business as usual, no?","No. [shaking head] We're throwing out the entire playbook, we're starting from scratch, we're implementing a brand new system."
4785,"Good, so, we're on the same page?","No. We're not. Michael, I know exactly how much time and man power are wasted in this branch. This company is getting younger, faster, more efficient. You need to prepare yourself."
4786,"So, how are you?",Awesome. I am dating a lot of guys.
4787,What?!,"Wait, uh, how do you touch just one of these buttons at a time?"
4788,"Wait, uh, how do you touch just one of these buttons at a time?",I don't know.
4789,Did you even try?,"If the kid wants to set mine up, I'll let him."
4790,"Kelly, I'm your boss now, OK? You can't keep talking to me like I'm your boyfriend.","Oh big strong man, fancy new whatever. I don't think you ever cared about me."
4791,"I never cared about you? Six months ago Karen Filipelli sent me an email. Asked me out. I said no, because I was committed to our relationship.","Well, I hope you're still committed because I'm pregnant."
4792,Do you feel prepared to help me raise a baby?,"I can... I can't talk about this right now, OK? After work, we'll go out to dinner, we'll talk about it then, OK?"
4793,"I can... I can't talk about this right now, OK? After work, we'll go out to dinner, we'll talk about it then, OK?",We have a date!
4794,"Hello, Dwight. I've been thinking about things and I wanted to know if you would have dinner with me tonight?",Really?
4795,Really?,Yes.
4796,Is Michael in?,In his office. You can go right in.
4797,You know what? I love the beard. Keep it forever. [goes into Michael's office],Hey.
4798,"[holds up Blackberry] Hey, what is the actual deal with these things in terms of testicles?",What?
4799,What?,I don't want to grow weird sperm in case we ever want to have kids.
4800,"So, what's Ryan doing here?","Oh, I dunno, they're launching a big new business plan. New website, blah blah blah. He's being a real twerp about it, so, it's all about youth, and agility and streamlining and trying to squeeze out the older people."
4801,What is that... word?,"Ageism? Companies they can't discriminate against people due to old age. Like a couple years ago we tried to force out some of the older branch managers with a mandatory retirement age and then Ed Truck, your old boss, threatened us with a lawsuit, so we had to back off."
4802,"Ageism? Companies they can't discriminate against people due to old age. Like a couple years ago we tried to force out some of the older branch managers with a mandatory retirement age and then Ed Truck, your old boss, threatened us with a lawsuit, so we had to back off.",So older people have just as many rights as younger people?
4803,So older people have just as many rights as younger people?,"Yes, Michael, they do."
4804,Creed?,"Yes, sir."
4805,Everything OK? [Creed has made his hair jet black],"Everything's cool, dude."
4806,"Still my office, Ryan. [Ryan sits down] Well, there has been a lot of talk about new ideas today. Well, new ideas are fine, but they are also... illegal, because they are a form of ageism. What? Yes, I am right. Did you know that the Age Discrimination and Employment Act of 1967 prohibits employment discrimination based on age with respect to employees 40 years of age or older? I did.","Technically, he's right."
4807,"Hey, shut up Toby. Look, why do we as a society hate old people so much?",Because they're lame.
4808,"No, Creed, no they are not. In fact, many cultures revere old people because of their storytelling ability. Like the old lady from Titanic. [points to her picture on the wall] Or the funny things that they can do, like 'where's the Beef?' [points to another picture on wall] [Jim raises his hand] Yeah.","Why do you have the Big picture up again? You used that already, when you burned your foot."
4809,"Why do you have the Big picture up again? You used that already, when you burned your foot.","Reusing the Ben Kingsley, too."
4810,Michael Scott?,"[puts hand up] That is me. Come on in. [They shake hands] Who is this old fart? Did you just stagger off the street? Out of a box or something? Who's this worthless bag of bones? Well, this guy is none other than one of the founders of Dunder Mifflin, Mr. Robert Dunder. Huh? [starts clapping, others join in]"
4811,"[puts hand up] That is me. Come on in. [They shake hands] Who is this old fart? Did you just stagger off the street? Out of a box or something? Who's this worthless bag of bones? Well, this guy is none other than one of the founders of Dunder Mifflin, Mr. Robert Dunder. Huh? [starts clapping, others join in]","Oh, yeah. Yes!"
4812,"Michael, [gets up] can I talk to you a second?",Sure thing. [both go out of conference room] 'Scuse me. [closes door]
4813,"Bob, how old are you?",I'm 87.
4814,"Eighty-seven years young. And still active. That is great. Did you know, that Bob is still a member of the Board of Dunder Mifflin?","Well, I, I, I haven't been to a board meeting in years. I, I send a proxy."
4815,That's great. Thank you for coming in. [starts ushering him out] Robert Dunder everybody. [clapping] Thank you. That was wonderful. Do you have a ride?,"Well I, I, I came here in a cab."
4816,"Inspirational. What have we learned?  Well, we have learned that you can't teach an old dog new tricks, because it's illegal, and you will go to jail. [Pam raises hand]",I think that I should help him get home.
4817,"Michael, technology helps business OK? You should not resist it, this is the way the world is moving.",I happen to think the old ways of doing business are better. And I can prove it.
4818,Ok. I look forward to hearing your ideas. [Michael retreats back to office] [to Kelly] Where do you wanna go?,"You know, some place romantic and expensive."
4819,Are you enjoying your vegetarian noodles?,Very much. How's your meat?
4820,Very much. How's your meat?,Dry. Delicious.
4821,Are you enjoying your mineral water?,I can't do this. I can't be with you. Every time I look in your eyes I see Sprinkles' stiff lifeless body.
4822,"Hey, Amy.  How ya doing?",Nice to meet you.
4823,"Yeah, sure. I'll, uh, I'll see you tonight, right?","Absolutely. [Toby kisses Amy for an extended period of time, Pam and Jim are shocked]"
4824,I wouldn't want to do that now would I?,Smell that. Do you smell that?
4825,Smell that. Do you smell that?,Dry rot?
4826,Dry rot?,"No, Dwight. That smells like good business to me. What I have done here is I have collected all the finest gourmet items that Scranton has to offer."
4827,Is that all?,Yes... [whispers] I miss you.
4828,"Dwight, you have to listen to me! We are not seeing each other anymore! Can you accept that?",Fine. [sighs] Then I just want to be friends.
4829,You don't?,No!
4830,"Right, so?",You really don't understand why that might make me kind of angry?
4831,You really don't understand why that might make me kind of angry?,No!
4832,Why not?,Hey.
4833,"Alright I just have to ask now that we're public, um, is the magic gone?",It's funny you bring that up because yes it is.
4834,"I knew it. Oh man, just like that huh?","I think... I mean, I don't know what it is but..."
4835,"That's honest. [sighs] Alright, fair enough. It was really fun while it lasted though, wasn't it?",Eh...
4836,"What's, uh, going on here?","I am glad that you asked, listen up everybody. In the last year, we have lost seven clients to the big chains. These gift baskets are our ticket back into their lives. We are going to show up at these businesses unannounced, and we are going to win them back."
4837,"With peanut brittle, with macadamia nut cookies, with chocolate turtles, with raspberry jam and a little bit of fat and salt because you know what? That's what people like.","Ever since I was a kid people have been telling me I can't do things. 'You can't be on the team', 'You can't move on to second grade'. Well, now they're telling me that I can't win back clients using old fashioned business methods. [shakes head] We'll see about that. And FYI, I eventually aced second grade, and I was the biggest kid in class."
4838,Why don't we just go by ourselves?,Why don't we just go as teams to demonstrate our teamsmanship?
4839,Why don't we just go as teams to demonstrate our teamsmanship?,Michael.
4840,Yes?,This is stupid.
4841,How is giving people gift baskets going to get our clients back?,"Gift baskets are amazing, Phyllis. Gift baskets are... the essence of class and fanciness. They are the ultimate present that a person can recieve."
4842,"What about cash? With cash you can buy anything you want, including a gift basket, so... it's kind of the best gift ever.",What about a gift basket full of cash?
4843,What about a gift basket full of cash?,Yes! Cash basket! Nice work Tuna.
4844,"[looks at vending machine] Hey brah, I've been meaning to ask you, can we get some Red Bull for these things? Sometimes a guy's gotta ride the bull, am I right? Later skater.","[in Michael's car] Sweet ride, American made. What happened to the Sebring?"
4845,"[in Michael's car] Sweet ride, American made. What happened to the Sebring?",It is in the body shop. Had to have the dent taken out of the hood where I hit Meredith.
4846,I know. So who's next?,Larry Myers. Left us six months ago for Office Depot.
4847,Why do you use that thing? Let's them know where you are at all times.,Who?
4848,Who?,"The government, spy satellites, private detectives... exgirlfriends. [sobs and then starts to cry]"
4849,"Oh, Jim! How awesome is Ryan now?","Yeah, he's definitely something."
4850,What does that mean?,"That whole lifestyle, his whole vibe, you find that appealing?"
4851,"That whole lifestyle, his whole vibe, you find that appealing?",Ha! Tuna... [inhales deeply] Tuna Tuna Tuna.
4852,"[places the gift basket on top of the table] Wow, those things are heavy! There's a lot of stuff in there. We have macadamia nut cookies, um, the honey mustard pretzels. Have you ever tried focaccia crisps?",You know we closed our account with you right?
4853,You know we closed our account with you right?,Yes we do.
4854,"OK, you know what? Just enjoy the gift basket and remember that we provide a personal touch.",Remember what we had Larry?
4855,Remember what we had Larry?,"I mean, really it's about money."
4856,[driving] That guy was so... how can they not know how much better we are?,I don't know. Sometimes people are just impossible and they make you miserable.
4857,How do they know? How does this know where to turn? That's very impressive.,Hey Pam. I haven't settled on our final design logo yet for Dunder Mifflin Infinity and I know you're into graphic design. Do you want to give it a shot? Maybe try and deisgn the logo?
4858,Hey Pam. I haven't settled on our final design logo yet for Dunder Mifflin Infinity and I know you're into graphic design. Do you want to give it a shot? Maybe try and deisgn the logo?,Uh totally.
4859,"Cool, that would be great. Um, can you do a couple mock ups and I'll take a look?",Yeah.
4860,"Ah, well it's still very good. I bet I know someone who hasn't heard that joke... your daughter Emily. How's she doing?","She's great, thanks for asking. Great memory."
4861,"She's gonna be like eleven this winter? Wow, they grow up so fast. I have a few of my own that I want some day. Listen, I don't want to take any more of your time, I know you're a very busy man. The reason we have stopped by is to drop you off this elaborate bag of goodies, and to ask you to reconsider.","Oh, OK."
4862,"OK, OK! So you'll reconsider?",OK thanks for the goodies.
4863,Ah... .is that all you have to say?,It looks delicious? I don't know.
4864,It looks delicious? I don't know.,You don't know?
4865,You don't know?,"Look, we want you back."
4866,Can you offer lower prices?,"Well, no."
4867,"Accept it, why would he come back?","Why would he come back? I will tell you, Dwight. He would come back because we offer a wide selection of products and because you're definitely not getting the same sort of customer service that you get with us."
4868,"Why would he come back? I will tell you, Dwight. He would come back because we offer a wide selection of products and because you're definitely not getting the same sort of customer service that you get with us.",That's not gonna change his mind. He's moving on. We had our chance and we killed it.
4869,"That's how it goes sometimes, you know? You lose everything and everything falls apart and eventually you die and no one remembers you.","That is a very good point, Dwight."
4870,"Remain calm! I have trained for this! [unfastens seat belt] Okay, exit the window! [Dwight and Michael exit through the window] Here we go! Look out for leeches! [swims toward Michael] Are you okay?! Swim for it! I got you! [Dwight grabs onto Michael while Michael opens the back door for the camera man] Michael! Michael!","Let go, let go of me!"
4871,[watching car get pulled from lake] You sure you're OK?,Fine.
4872,Did you get the rental insurance? Because that is pretty important too at a time like this.,"What a disaster, this whole thing."
4873,"What about that last guy, Aaron? Is he a jerk. 'I don't even know if I want it. They're website is so easy'. Yeah, well, you can have your technology jackass, look where it got us.","[speaking on the cell phone] Yes, we need a cab at Lake Scranton, at the end of East Mountain Road, in the lake."
4874,Hang up. [Dwight hangs up] You know what we're gonna do? We're walking back. We're walking back to that office and we're gonna reclaim our gift basket!,Yes!
4875,"So place it on the infinity thing without being obvious, you know? I'd love to do like a color version just to bring a little color to the logo.","I like it a lot. It's clear and subtle at the same time. It's really good, you have a real talent for this stuff."
4876,Do you want to go out to dinner tonight?,Oh... is it...
4877,What?,Um...
4878,You're kidding?,We're together.
4879,Did you forget something? What happened to you guys?,"Give it back. The gift basket, give it back."
4880,Oh what is this?,"It's real simple. If you don't appreciate what we do, then give us back our basket."
4881,What's missing... the turtles. Where are the turtles? Where are the turtles?,"Come on guys, get out of here!"
4882,WHERE ARE THE TURTLES? WHERE ARE THEY?,"[enters nearby room] Excuse me I have an announcement to make. We seem to be missing a box of chocolate turtles with peacons, and we will not be leaving the premises until we obtain them. Hand. Over. The. Turtles. Now!"
4883,"May I have your attention please? This office will not be using any new technology ever, starting now.",That is not correct.
4884,Ryan thinks that technology is the answer. Well guess what? I just drove my car into a lake.,You did what?
4885,You did what?,"I drove my car into a [bleep] lake. Why you may ask did I do this? Well, because of a machine. A machine told me to drive into a lake. And I did it! I did it because I trusted Ryan's precious technology, and look where it got me."
4886,"I drove my car into a [bleep] lake. Why you may ask did I do this? Well, because of a machine. A machine told me to drive into a lake. And I did it! I did it because I trusted Ryan's precious technology, and look where it got me.",Into a lake.
4887,Did you get any clients back?,"Maybe, maybe not, time will tell. But I will tell you one thing. Those gift baskets never endangered anybody's lives. [looks at Ryan] Game set match... point... Scott... game over... end of game."
4888,You don't want me to help?,"You don't know what I'm going to talk about.  [Michael heads toward chairs]  Actually, can you do me a favor?"
4889,"You don't know what I'm going to talk about.  [Michael heads toward chairs]  Actually, can you do me a favor?",Yes?
4890,Yes?,Can you get me a cold water?
4891,Can you get me a cold water?,I got it.
4892,"That was slightly harsh, don't you think?","I spent three years, driving around, getting him yams and magic wands.  He can get me water."
4893,Ryan is causing some problems.  And you were always good at handling him.  What should I do to control him?,"Well, he's super-ticklish, I don't know if that helps."
4894,Did you Google Confucius and just print out the first thing you saw?,"No, I skipped through all of the boring stuff and went right to his joke page.  Which proves that he was old, but he was also hilarious."
4895,"[sighs, whistles] Michael, please would you not email while we're having lunch?",I'm not.  It's solitaire.  See?
4896,I'm not.  It's solitaire.  See?,BlackBerry.  Why would anyone name something like this after a fruit?  You wouldn't name an iPod after a fruit.  [drops BlackBerry on desk]  Excuse me while I type on my Banana.  I'm gonna go to the Orange store and buy an Apricot computer.  [thinks] Apple. [nods]
4897,BlackBerry.  Why would anyone name something like this after a fruit?  You wouldn't name an iPod after a fruit.  [drops BlackBerry on desk]  Excuse me while I type on my Banana.  I'm gonna go to the Orange store and buy an Apricot computer.  [thinks] Apple. [nods],This is going on the outside.  The pipe cleaner needs to go through the corner.  Do not tape those on.
4898,I'm a little busy right now.  Could you BlackBerry me a message?,Sure.
4899,"Okay, everyone, I have a conference call, but after that, I'm going to lead a BlackBerry tutorial for anyone who's having any problems.  Who here's set theirs up? [Jim and Andy raise their hands; Phyllis half-raises hers.  Ryan notices that Michael does not raise his]  Great.  Well, I will see the rest of you at 2:30.","You didn't set up your BlackBerry, Dwight?"
4900,"You didn't set up your BlackBerry, Dwight?","Yes, I did, but I do not intend to use it.  It is pointless technology."
4901,What about cars?,They fall under the category of airplanes.
4902,"They do?  So, cars are flightless airplanes.",Correct.
4903,"Hey, Dwight, what about vaccines?",[scoffs] Vaccines are for chumps!
4904,Sup? [rolls into kitchen on a skateboard],"Hi, Creed, what's up?"
4905,"Hi, Creed, what's up?","Just boardin', you know how we do. [flips skateboard up]"
4906,"Oh, thanks ese.  So, what are you guys doing?",What do you mean?
4907,What do you mean?,"To look younger, so the kid doesn't replace you with machines."
4908,"And the same thing goes for quarterly reports.  They are unreadable.  They're just numbers and boring and blech.

5173,"What'cha talking about?  [camera pans to each face in the break room]  Okay, I know what's going on.  You're talking about Jim and Pam, if they're having sex, what it looks like, I know, I think---",Michael.
5174,"Michael, are you having money problems?","Monkey problem? No, I'm not having monkey problems.  Why would I have monkey problems?"

5176,"What's going on, why do you have a second job?",I don't have a second job.  Maybe I'm having an affair with Suzanne Summers.

5181,"How would that help Creed?  In Monopoly when you go bankrupt, you lose.","You don't go by Monopoly man, that game is nuts.  Nobody just picks up 'get out of jail free' cards, those things cost thousands."
5182,Twelve hundred dollars.  What's a Core Blaster Extreme?,"That is by far the best way to strengthen your core.  This machine, you sit on a stabilizer ball, you put your feet into the power stir-ups, you reach up and you grab onto the super rod, and you twist, and you twist, and you twist.  It strengthens your entire core.  Your back core, your arm core, the Marine Core actually uses it.  I think that's how they got a core."

5194,Yeah?,Yeah.
5195,What's going on?,"Not much, what's up with you?"
5196,"Not much, what's up with you?","Well, why are you sitting on a train?  Where are you going?"
5197,"Well, why are you sitting on a train?  Where are you going?",I'm out of answers Jan.
5198,What does that mean?,"I told you, no more answers.  This is who I am now.  A guy on a train with no answers.  I hope that can be enough for you."
5199,"Michael, no, what I want to say is you were there for me.  By my side.  Without even a thought.  That's just who you are.  I mean, no matter how badly I treat you, or what I'm going through, you just, you are there for me.  And that is a guy worth staying beside.  So, where's this train taking us?",I think the engineer left.
5200,"Do you think I'll get any new ones?  I could... [pause, eventually looks up at Dwight]",What?
5201,What?,"What do you mean, 'what'?"
5202,"What do you mean, 'what'?",What... [mumbling]

5205,What is the matter with... me?,Yeah.
5206,Yeah.  What?,"I hate to ask you this, but are there any retirement funds you can borrow from?"

5208,You have CDs?,I do.
5209,"Okay, good, okay.  What bank?","My CDs are in a portfolio, a rather large portfolio, um, called Case Logic"

5211,Why?,I can't go back to that.
5212,I think you can.  I... what?,I don't know if I can do that.  I can't see myself spending the next six years digging myself out of that kind of hole.
5213,"All right, well then maybe there's another way, you know?  I mean, we could just... we'll think of something else.",We will?  I can't.  I don't have an idea in my head.
5214,We will?  I can't.  I don't have an idea in my head.,"Well... well, we will."
5215,Okay.  What?  Um...,I have some ideas.
5216,"Well, please?  I won't tell anybody.","Oh, yes, you will."
5217,"I'm talking about Angela, okay?  Did you hear what she was saying to Pam the other day?","Yes, I did, 'cept I don't think she means it.  Angela is in a great deal of pain because of the death of her cat, and she's in a kind of a grieving process, and it makes her say things.  So... best to just lay off."
5218,"Angela, you like lacrosse?","Lacrosse, the sport?"
5219,"Lacrosse, the sport?",Scranton U. Varsity's gonna scrimmage the J.V. squad.  Should be pretty interesting.  J.V. gets really amped.

5231,"What? No, why?","You got it, you're so close!"

5233,"Hey, how ya doin'?",Michael Scott.
5234,I would like you to meet Andrew Bernard. The 'Nard Dog. Who let the 'Nard Dog out?,Hoo hoo hoo-hoo!
5235,Urban? I grew up in a small town. What about me seems urban to you?,Stanley is hilarious. Phyllis is like our Mrs. Butterworth. Kind of a less urban Aunt Jemima.
5236,Who else?,"I think it's great that the company's making a commercial because not very many people have heard of us. I mean, when I tell people that I work at Dunder Mifflin, they think that we sell mufflers, or muffins, or mittens, or... And frankly all of those sound better than paper, so I let it slide."
5237,You playing that game again?,"Second Life is not a game. It is a multi-user virtual environment. It doesn't have points or scores, it doesn't have winners or losers."
5238,Why don't we show you what we did with the Nashua branch?,"Mmm. Okay. [commercial plays on laptop, peppy music in background]"
5239,That's what Nassau came up with? That sucks! [chuckles] Whoa.,That's what we came up with.
5240,The waving?,"Well, no, no. You don't have to be waving. That was just what they did. You guys can be clapping. Sitting. Standing outside, inside, whatever. This is where you really get to be creative."
5241,"I need some advice. I've been spending a lot of time making out with Angela lately. But we've been necking, but only necking.  Right? Not actually kissing, our mouths, just the neck on neck. It's just like rubbing slash nuzzling our necks together. It's hot, I'm not going to lie to you , but it's a little weird, but you seem like a guy with answers, so how do I fast track this to get to first base?","We cannot talk about this... because, someone might hear us."
5242,Dwike?,You have a call from Eddie Murphy.
5243,Hello?,"[on speakerphone, Eddie Murphy voice] Shrek! Shrek, I'm a donkey! I'm a donkey, Shrek! [laughing] I'm just kidding. It's me. Hello Ry."
5244,What?,"Okay, calm down. I have a small problem."
5245,"Okay, I'm not really interested in that right now. I'm delegating creativity to creative professionals. It's a different skills set. Look, I wasn't good at sales, right?",Yeah!
5246,"Are you? I don't think you're doing such a good job here, suppressing ideas and creativity.","All right, let me ask you this, tell me if you think this is creative. When I was five, I imagined that there was such a thing as a unicorn. And this is before I had even heard of one, or seen one. I just drew a picture of a horse that could fly over rainbows, and had a huge spike in its head. And I was five, five years old. Couldn't even talk yet."
5247,"Okay, when should we come back?","How about never hundred hours, sir."
5248,"[on phone] Michael, David Wallace.  What is this about dismissing the ad people?","Yeah, I'm glad you called. Ryan is being a little bitch again."
5249,"What's up my brotha? Listen, David, I would like to do this ad in house. I want to use only the creativity that we have right here in the office. And I will send it to you tomorrow morning, take a look at it, and if you do not think that it's ready to air, send the ad agency back down here, and we'll do it on my dime.",This is weird.
5250,"Has anyone ever come up to you and said, 'You're not creative'?",Yes.
5251,"Who are you talking to, specifically?",I kind of know what it's like to be in commercials. My nickname in high school used to be Kool-Aid Man. [makes squinty face]
5252,"Okay, okay, Phyllis this is what I want you to do. I want you to go down to the mall. I want you to get in line. I want you to get her to be in this commercial. This would be a huge coupe people. All right? Do not take no for an answer.",Okay.
5253,"Does anyone actually know what Sue Grafton looks like? I mean, is she hot or-?",She's crazy hot.
5254,Well then maybe we should just use Angela and say she's Sue Grafton. Would anyone notice?,That's not happening.
5255,What's rap?,"Okay, Darryl, wow, you need to learn a lot about your own culture. I'll make you a mix."
5256,Are you serious?,Yeah.
5257,Who's that?,"Oh, it's just my avatar guy. Whatever."
5258,He looks a lot like you. How much time did you spend on that?,"Not much, it's just for tracking Dwight so---"
5259,Right... you're a sports writer in Philadelphia? Nice build too.,Yep.
5260,"Andy, Andy, this is a pivotal scene in the ad. And if we don't get this, if we don't nail it, we're going to lose the whole triumph of the moment. The triumph of the will. Now, God, what? What Phyllis?","[crying] Well, I got in line to buy Sue Grafton's book and when it came to my turn I asked if she wanted to be in the ad and she said no thank you, but I wasn't supposed to take no for an answer."
5261,"Did you, or did you not get Sue Grafton?",[sobbing] No.
5262,"Ugh, can somebody give her a tissue please? [Kevin hands her piece of tape]","I hope you're not killing yourself on this, because I'm sure it's good enough for Michael's ad that will probably be seen by no one."
5263,Okay. Do you want me to stay?,"No no, you can go home. I'm good."
5264,You comin'?,"I, ah..."
5265,"No, no no no, this is good. You know how we haven't really gotten anywhere that I want to get to physically yet? Well, last night, that changed. We're makin' out, I'm kissin' her neck, and cheek and her ear lobe, and she's not really kissing me back. But she closes her eyes and she's like, 'Oh D, oh D.'",She called you D?
5266,She called you D?,Yeah. D for Andy.
5267,[on phone] Yes?,"Pam, please clear my phone lines."
5268,"Hey, could you do me a favor? Could you put that in the DVD player?","Hey everybody! Just want to welcome you all to the premiere of the real Dunder Mifflin commercial, the Michael Scott director's cut. Hope you like it."
5269,Animation? All her by the way. [points at Pam],Really?
5270,Really?,I just thought you should---
5271,"Hey listen, you ever been on a motorcycle?",Ahh. [puts his arm around Pam]
5272,"All right! So, anybody else? No bad ideas. Everybody, let's keep 'em coming... oh, God.  Okay, Toby?","Well, you know how everyone fast forwards through ads these days? Well, what about an ad in slow motion. You know, if they fast forward through it, it'll just seem normal and it will catch your eye. Plus, uh, the slogan could be: Dunder Mifflin, we adapt to the pace of your business. [murmurs of approval by everyone but Michael]"
5273,"Well, you know how everyone fast forwards through ads these days? Well, what about an ad in slow motion. You know, if they fast forward through it, it'll just seem normal and it will catch your eye. Plus, uh, the slogan could be: Dunder Mifflin, we adapt to the pace of your business. [murmurs of approval by everyone but Michael]","There are no bad ideas but for an idea, that was really, really bad."
5274,"And that is probably why most ads suck. [points to the ad men waiting outside the conference room] Oh, that's them!  Those are the ad guys right there. All right, my very fortunate and creative group, go back to your desks and I will let you know when it is time to film. [everyone starts leaving the conference room] [loud whisper] Pam! Pam, come here for a second. Did you get the memo about dressing your best?",Yeah.
5275,About dressing your best today?,"Yeah, I distribute so I get all the memos."
5276,"This is Pam Beesly, representing our girl next door.  Pretty but nothing special.  You know, but she sort of keeps it real. What you might want to do, is if you could zoom in, like really quick zooms on her. Might be good.  [walking away]  Who else? [pointing] Oh, Creed... is the old guy over there. Don't look at him. You might want to use him to sort of get that Orville Redenbacher dynamic going.",Sure.
5277,"And if not we can just make him disappear. [walks quickly over to Jim's desk] This is Jim! Halpert. Jim has a very expressive face, don't you Jim? He is like our Mr. Bean.",Okay.
5278,You know what?,This is bull[censored]!
5279,What?  What?,"No, I can do it."
5280,What?,"I can do it good.  I can do it good.  Please, don't.  Please.  [kneels in front of desk] Please give me it."
5281,[taps on desk and starts to leave his office] Do you want this open or closed?,"Closed. [Michael leaves his office, gives Jim two thumbs up, which Jim returns]"
5282,"Hey, everybody, I just got off the phone with David Wallace, and he has given us the go-ahead to make the first ever Dunder Mifflin television commercial.  Huh?",[applause]
5283,"Okay, okay.  Who could do music?",How about Darryl?
5284,How about Darryl?,"Actually, I'm a little concerned about having a black person do the music, because that could create a positive stereotype that could then become a... celestine prophesy, and keep the next Bon Jovi from ever picking up a piano."
5285,Karen?  He's on line one.,"Thanks Ro.  Hey, we finally connected.  How's Scranton?"
5286,"Thanks Ro.  Hey, we finally connected.  How's Scranton?",I am the regional manager of Dunder-Mifflin Utica branch.  Turns out it's a pretty easy gig when your boss isn't an idiot and your boyfriend's not in love with somebody else.
5287,"Look, All I'm saying is it would be a great opportunity, and we'd love to have you come aboard.  So think about it, okay?  Okay, bye.","Look, for the record, a certain Scranton salesman approached me, okay?"
5288,"Look, for the record, a certain Scranton salesman approached me, okay?",This is perfect.
5289,"Well, sometimes.  Most of the time I will be with Ryan, or Darryl.  [knock on the door]  Yes?  Oh good, good Stanley!  First victim, this is what I want you to do.  Go out, come back in.  We're going to hide.  I want you to tell me if this looks like me, okay?",I don't understand why sleeping at your desk is better than you not being here.
5290,What?,"Hey everyone, can I have your attention please?  I just thought you all should know that Stanley Hudson is planning on leaving us, because our old friend Karen from Utica is going to give him more money to work there."
5291,"Hey everyone, can I have your attention please?  I just thought you all should know that Stanley Hudson is planning on leaving us, because our old friend Karen from Utica is going to give him more money to work there.",[applause]
5292,"Okay, smarty pants, then why?  Why is she trying to take Stanley from us?",I think it's because of my sales record.
5293,How can I get you to stay?,Money.
5294,"Oscar, did you bring it?",To be Edwardian.  His best work.
5295,So tell me again why I can't be part of your club?,Because some people think you monopolize the conversation by trying to be funny.
5296,Oscar?,Some people.
5297,[on phone] Hello?,"Fillipellers, how's it hanging?"
5298,"Fillipellers, how's it hanging?",Michael...
5299,To the left?,"Listen, I-"
5300,To the right?,I'm-
5301,"Okay, good-bye.  Wait!  Wait! Karen, could you transfer me to one of your salespeople please?  Your best one?  [Karen hangs up]","I have Ben Nugent on the line, he is the top salesman in Utica."
5302,"I'm going to cut right to the chase here.  Do you like magic?  Because I'm a genie in a bottle, and I'm going to grant you three wishes.  To move to Scranton, to have a great job, and to be my best friend.",Aren't you the guy that hit the woman with your car?
5303,Aren't you the guy that hit the woman with your car?,[giggles]
5304,"Everyone says Scranton branch is worse than Camden.  Didn't everyone from Stanford quit, like immediately?","No, I fired them, and your next. ... So what do you say?"
5305,"No, I fired them, and your next. ... So what do you say?",Seriously?
5306,Seriously?,"What is that guy talking about?  Scranton is not lame.  Scranton is the cool, fun branch.  We're like Animal House."
5307,"What is that guy talking about?  Scranton is not lame.  Scranton is the cool, fun branch.  We're like Animal House.",Found him!
5308,So what are you going to do?,"What are we going to do?  We are going to make a monster sale, that's what we're going to do.  Corcroan dropped Staples."
5309,"What are we going to do?  We are going to make a monster sale, that's what we're going to do.  Corcroan dropped Staples.",Did they?
5310,Did they?,"Yes they did, oh yes they did, and we are going to murder it.  You, me, Dwight are going to jump into my PT Cruiser, and we're going to crush this sale.  We're going to prove, what the hell is that music?"
5311,"Yes they did, oh yes they did, and we are going to murder it.  You, me, Dwight are going to jump into my PT Cruiser, and we're going to crush this sale.  We're going to prove, what the hell is that music?","It's Vivaldi, for Finer Things."
5312,"That's the problem, that's the problem.  We need rock n' roll Pam, rock n' roll.  Alright? [sees Toby in a bow-tie holding a plate full of tea cups] Oh... My... God, that's why people are leaving.  I- I have no words.",We just passed the exit for Corcroan.
5313,What? What? We did?,"Surprise!  Ha, ha, ha, ha, ha."
5314,What are we doing?,"Egg dripping, blah, blah, blah."
5315,"What are we doing, Dwight, what we are doing?","Well, gee, Jim, I don't know, I guess there's no sales call today."
5316,We're going to Utica?,Uh-huh.
5317,Are you calling Karen?,"No, I'm not calling Karen."
5318,"What are you doing? Stop it, Dwight!",[throws Jim's cell phone out of the window] Gah-ah-hah-ha!
5319,Are you kidding me?,No communication with the outside world Jim.
5320,You know what?  I'm just going to call a cab from here.,"Alright, you're going to miss the best prank ever."

5324,"So, why did you and Karen break up?  Was it the sex?",What?
5325,What?,"I can't imagine the sex being bad, I mean her body is..."
5326,"Okay, you know what?",...awesome.
5327,Why don't we play that alphabet game that you were talking about?,"Okay, I will start.  Um, 'A.' [singing] 'A' my name is Alan, and my wife's name is Alice, we live in Alaska, and we sell...  Damn it! What do we sell?  Um..."
5328,"Okay, I will start.  Um, 'A.' [singing] 'A' my name is Alan, and my wife's name is Alice, we live in Alaska, and we sell...  Damn it! What do we sell?  Um...",It doesn't matter.
5329,"Ah, la, la, la. What is that?  That sound...  The air-conditioning leaking or something?","That doesn't make sense, couldn't be."
5330,"What is that?  Dwight, are you peeing?",I'm peeing in this empty can.
5331,Can you imagine a life where all you have to do is summer in the Italian countryside?,"I know right?  I just want to go, and look at art, and swim in the Adriatic."
5332,"I know right?  I just want to go, and look at art, and swim in the Adriatic.","And spend time with George Emerson.  That's what I would do.  I mean it's the best male protagonist we've read, right?"
5333,"And spend time with George Emerson.  That's what I would do.  I mean it's the best male protagonist we've read, right?","[joins them at the table] Totally, I mean, come on, such a free spirit."
5334,What are you doing?,"Just came to discuss my favorite E.M. Forester novel.  Pam, these finger sandwiches look finger-lickin' delicious Pam."
5335,Why can't I be in the club?,"I can't believe we're here, I can't believe this is happening."
5336,"Afro wig, do you want the afro wig?","No, Michael.  I'm not leaving the car."
5337,"Dwight, nothing with the eyes, please?","Okay, Jim."

5341,"Okay, you know what?  You don't need to be updating me as much as you're updating me.",Well...
5342,"There's a security guard coming by.  Hello, we're warehouse workers.  Would you like more proof?","Oh my God, oh my God, that was very close."
5343,Isn't that thing huge?,"It's enormous, but it's got wheels.  We're wheeling it down the hall, into the stairwell.  Get the car ready, keep the engine running."
5344,Did you say Karen?,"Take her to a motel, make love to her Jim."
5345,Jim?,Hey Karen.
5346,"Uh, what are you doing here?","First of all, hi."
5347,What are you doing here?,"You good?  I'm just checking on the other branches.  Michael wants me to do that from time to time, so..."
5348,"You good?  I'm just checking on the other branches.  Michael wants me to do that from time to time, so...",Do not tell Karen about the industrial copier.
5349,"Let me ask you, did you accomplish what you wanted?","Listen lady, you can expect these kind of repercussions as long as you keep trying to poach our people."
5350,"Jim, hang on a second?",Yes?
5351,Yes?,"So you're still doing this kind of stuff, huh?"
5352,"So you're still doing this kind of stuff, huh?","Yeah, trying to quit though."
5353,"Oh, things are going really well?  Are they?  They are?  That's great, that's so great.  I wanna hear more about how happy you are with Pam.  Can you tell me more about that?  Thank you so much for coming to Utica, and breaking my copier, and telling me how well things are going in your relationship, really, thank you.","[slinking out of the room] Alright, you are welcome.  I'm going to go because of, um, traffic."
5354,Michael?  A word?,Of course.
5355,Really?,"I wasn't really planning on leaving, all I wanted was a raise.  How on Earth did Michael call my bluff?  Is he some sort of secret genius? [laughs] Sometimes I say crazy things."
5356,"I wasn't really planning on leaving, all I wanted was a raise.  How on Earth did Michael call my bluff?  Is he some sort of secret genius? [laughs] Sometimes I say crazy things.",Hey.
5357,"I'm so sorry, Rolando told me everything.  How humiliating.  Would it help you to return to another age?  A time of refinement, and civility.",Are you inviting me to the Finer Things Club?
5358,Are you inviting me to the Finer Things Club?,[nods head yes]
5359,Fun?,Mm-hmm.
5360,Really?,Yeah.
5361,What was fun about it for you?  Was it the death of the twins?,"No, that wasn't fun."
5362,Did you even read it?,Of course I read it.
5363,How does it end?,Who was the main character?
5364,Who was the main character?,Angela.  Nope.  The ashes.
5365,"Well, you're driving, right?","Yes, I am, but I want shotgun for you."
5366,"Wait, you're going along with this now?","I have to.  Pam, if I'm not there, someone's going to go to jail.  Or die."
5367,Because you love her?  [baby voice]  Because you love her very much?,"All right, I'm gonna go now."
5368,"Would it have killed you to spend the afternoon making love to her in a motel room?  Like I begged you to?  Pam would have understood.  Heck, Pam would have done it.",Pam is down for anything.
5369,Did you sleep in cabins?,"Under the stars. It was really beautiful, you should come."
5370,Who went?,"Me, Dan from Buffalo, Mark Chisholm, Jeff from Albany and Ryan, obviously. Made so many s'mores, that I finally had to say, 'No more s'mores, no more s'mores.' [everyone in room but Michael laughs, Michael exits break room]"
5371,"Hypothetically, if I were to ask you to go camping, and you know what hypothetical means? [Jim makes a face] Not real.",Got it.
5372,"So if I were to hypothetically ask you to go camping with me, would you go?","Absolutely, yes."
5373,Really?,Yeah?
5374,Yeah?,"Oh, you wanna go today?"
5375,"Oh, you wanna go today?",And I am always busy.
5376,How often can you actually donate blood?,Is there a limit?
5377,Is there a limit?,Your body only has a certain amount.
5378,"Well, is that it? Or?","Yeah, just this whole Toby, camping thing, uh, seems a little lame."
5379,How so?,"A bunch of guys, in a tent? Making s'mores? [makes a noise and gestures with his hands]"
5380,"A bunch of guys, in a tent? Making s'mores? [makes a noise and gestures with his hands]",What's that?
5381,What's that?,"Hello, I'm Broken Mountain. You know, here's the thing. That's not how you go camping. I think you go camping by yourself---"
5382,Do you want me to ask where you're going?,No.
5383,"Hmm, no, the choice is actually yours. Are you sure you want to do this?","Yes, and I am leaving you in charge of the office for the rest of the day and for the next several days. Do not try to follow me."
5384,"Do I believe that Michael possesses the skills to survive in a hostile environment? Let's put it this way: no, I do not.","This is what a true survivor man does. You simulate a disaster, like a plane wreck. You could only wear the clothes that you have on, and you could only use the stuff you have in your pockets. Now, in this case, this disaster is a serial killer. Creepy guy who's abducted me and is taking me out into the wilderness to leave me for dead."
5385,What are you doing?,"I am putting this on so I have no familiarity with my surroundings. Now this way, I can't retrace my steps. I don't know what streets we've been--- [Dwight whacks Michael with his shoe] Ow! What are you doing?"
5386,"I am putting this on so I have no familiarity with my surroundings. Now this way, I can't retrace my steps. I don't know what streets we've been--- [Dwight whacks Michael with his shoe] Ow! What are you doing?",It would be better if you were unconscious.
5387,Do you want to do this right or not?,"Just, please allow me to have one cathartic experience in my life?"
5388,"Just, please allow me to have one cathartic experience in my life?","Jim, we need to order a cake for Creed's birthday."
5389,"Oh, wasn't it just someone's birthday?","Yes. Kelly's was last week, remember?"
5390,"Yes. Kelly's was last week, remember?","I do remember, yeah."
5391,"You know what, I have an idea. Why don't we just do one big shared party?",What?
5392,What?,"There are thirteen people working in this office, so thirteen times a year Michael gets a cake and balloons, and some sort of joke gift and makes a toast. There are two types of toasts. One is a joke about how old you are."
5393,"And the other is something inappropriate. Or horrible. Or both. What else? He only sings the high harmony to 'Happy Birthday.' And he's a very big believer in surprise parties. Maybe even, arguably, possibly to a fault.","[flashback to Kelly's birthday, hiding in the elevator] Happy Birthday!"
5394,"Wow! You're shaking things up a bit, huh?","It's a pretty good idea, don't you think?"
5395,"It's a pretty good idea, don't you think?",Do you think it's a good idea?
5396,Do you think it's a good idea?,No... I think it's a great idea.
5397,"Here we go, into the wild. Mighty forest. Can you smell the trees and the nature?","Keep going, you're fine. Just some bushes and some thickets [leads Michael into some tall grass] Keep going. You wanted wilderness, you got it."
5398,"Alright. [starts walking away, but returns] Oh, did you see my memo by the way?","[picks up and reads memo] 'Let's be honest, as fun as birthdays are we could all use a break from the constant cake, so let's celebrate birthday month in style today.' This is really cool."
5399,Right? I was just thinking...,"No, totally, totally. This way we get it all out of the way at once and it could actually be fun."
5400,"What are you doing? Stop. Dwight, Dwight. Just --",I'm just --
5401,"Hey, Jim, can I have my own cake?",What's that?
5402,What's that?,I really prefer devils food cake.
5403,What do you want?,I want pie. I want peach pie.
5404,You want a birthday pie?,I want a nice cobbler.
5405,"Me likey the ice cream cake, okay? Fudgie the Whale.",Not your birthday.
5406,"What is Jim thinking? It's a birthday, so what if there's a lot of them?","Yeah, I work hard all day. I like knowing that there's going to be a break. Most days I just sit and wait for the break."
5407,Why don't you just have an apple?,Why don't you mind your business?
5408,Why don't you mind your business?,"Listen, I figured this out. Jimmy had his birthday three weeks ago, so he doesn't care."
5409,"Hey guys, what're we talking about?",Nothing! Nothing going on. We're talking about nothing. C'mon gang.
5410,What?,"Well, it... there was. But Michael scheduled it for 4:58 on a Friday. You know, people sang in the parking lot."
5411,Seriously?,I just though you could add me.  I don't see the harm in that.
5412,"OK. Yeah, you know what, we're just gonna throw you in. Because more the merrier, right?","No. No way. I am not a machine, Jim. You can't just change plans willy nilly and expect these little magic party elves to do your bidding. We already have devils food, peach cobbler, Fudgie the Whale, mushroom caps."
5413,"That's a bummer. OK, then we need to...[steps outside office] Hey everybody. Hi, how you doing? Can I have your attention please?  'Cause we have to talk about this birthday thing.",[raises hand] Conference room?
5414,[raises hand] Conference room?,"Yes, conference room in five minutes... No. No. We're gonna solve it right here. We're actually gonna talk about it out here. So, who has problems with the birthday thing? [everyone raises hands] One, two, three, everybody. OK, so then we just shouldn't do it."
5415,"Yes, conference room in five minutes... No. No. We're gonna solve it right here. We're actually gonna talk about it out here. So, who has problems with the birthday thing? [everyone raises hands] One, two, three, everybody. OK, so then we just shouldn't do it.",What am I supposed to do with two cakes and a pie?'
5416,What am I supposed to do with two cakes and a pie?',"Oh, I'll take 'em."
5417,What up?,Sure glad you're back.
5418,So what did I miss?,"Well, I tried to put all the birthdays together at once."
5419,You did do it?,"Uh huh. Yeah, just wait. Ten years, you'll figure it out."
5420,That's what who said?,"I never know. I just say it. I say stuff like that, you know, to lighten the tension. When things sort of get hard."
5421,"Oh, it's Creed's birthday today.  Should we get him an ice-cream cake?  Mint chocolate chip?","Pam, are you my friend?"
5422,"Pam, are you my friend?","Oh, no."
5423,"We have been friends forever, right?","Yes, I have been working with you forever."
5424,"Hypothetically... would you go camping with me, if I were to ask you?  And bear in mind that I would never actually ask you to go camping.  That Jim is also a friend of mine, and I would rather die than make any sort of improper ovation toward you.",I don't think so.
5425,"Do you understand that Jim is like a brother to me, and I would never do anything inappropriate?",I do.
5426,"So, as friends, would you go with me on a camping trip?",No.
5427,You're welcome.  Open or closed?,"Split the difference.  Hey... mint chocolate chip, please?  Is Jim out there?"
5428,"Split the difference.  Hey... mint chocolate chip, please?  Is Jim out there?",No.
5429,Can you send Dwight in here?,"Yeah.  Dwight, Michael wants to see you in his office. [Dwight runs in]"
5430,You wanted to see me?,"Mmhmm.  I had something very personal I would like to discuss. [Dwight closes door, takes off glasses, kneels in front of Michael's desk]  Would you go find Jim, and send him in here, please?"
5431,"Mmhmm.  I had something very personal I would like to discuss. [Dwight closes door, takes off glasses, kneels in front of Michael's desk]  Would you go find Jim, and send him in here, please?",I'm on it.
5432,How much time do I have?,"Jim, Michael's office."
5433,Don't you want a sheath for that?,"No, just get me a case. [Dwight looks at the camera, lifts his leg onto the desk, removes the sheath from his ankle, and gives it to Michael]  All right."
5434,Anything else?  Flint...,MmMmm.  All I need...
5435,[holding up knife] What is this called again?,"So the figures show improvement right there, Michael. And again- [Pam walks in and shows Michael a note]"
5436,"Uh, okay, all right. Pam, would you put the call through? [Pam pushes a button the phone] Hi buddy.","I don't know, it's just, ugh, I never felt welcomed there, you know? It's such a...boys club."
5437,"I don't know, it's just, ugh, I never felt welcomed there, you know? It's such a...boys club.","Yeah, I hate that."
5438,"Yes, yes. Pat-tern. Patt-ern. My friend Pat took a turn. That's how I remember that. Could we pull over and put down the top? I'm feeling a little queasy.","Um, no, I want it up. My hair."
5439,Does this work for you?,Yep. Tell them how much you're gonna get if you win.
5440,"Hey, Schneider, real quick. What do you call a butt load of lawyers driving off a cliff?",A good start. And I think it's busload.
5441,"Yeah, a bunch of rich lawyers took the bus. [To Jan] Where did you find this guy? Hey, there he is.",Hey Michael.
5442,Could we talk off the record? As friends?,I would love that.
5443,"Jan... has put the company in a very tough position here. Now you've been with us for a long time. Over 10 years, right? We just want to be sure that you won't do anything to hurt us with your testimony. Do you understand?",Abso-fruitley. Yeah. I'll-I'll do anything for the company.
5444,What has two skinny chicken legs and sucks at ping pong?,"Hi, Kelly."
5445,Guess whose boyfriend it is?,I don't wanna guess.
5446,Jim. Can I see you for a second?,Sure.
5447,Please? Kelly's trash talking me because Darryl is beating you.,"What, seriously? What is she saying?"
5448,"What, seriously? What is she saying?","[flashback, to Pam] Your boyfriend is so weak, he needs steroids just to watch baseball."
5449,"[flashback, to Pam] Were Jim's parents first cousins that were also bad at ping pong?",So you're asking me to defend your honor against Kelly?
5450,So you're asking me to defend your honor against Kelly?,"Sorta, yes."
5451,"Hi. [Michael sees Toby] No, no, absolutely not. What is he doing here?",Toby?
5452,Toby?,"Are you renewing your divorce vows, before my deposition?"
5453,"Are you renewing your divorce vows, before my deposition?","Michael, I'm your HR Rep. I'm on your side."
5454,"Michael, just relax, okay?","You know, I think they're, uh ready for us now. So.."
5455,"Mr. Scott. Do you swear to tell the truth, the whole truth, and nothing but the truth?",Yessh.
5456,"Mr. Scott, can you describe the circumstances of Ms. Levinson's termination?","Well, it was not just termination. It was a pattern of disrespect and inappropriate behavior."
5457,About what?,He needs help balancing some travel receipts.
5458,Are you sure he wants me? Because I have Oscar balance my travel receipts.,"Yeah, no, he asked for you specifically. He's in the conference room."
5459,How long have you known the plaintiff?,"I haven't actually seen it. But I have seen the firm, and I am planning on renting The Pelican Brief"
5460,How long have you known Ms. Levinson?,Six years and two months.
5461,And you were directly under her the entire time?,That's what she said.
5462,Excuse me?,That's what she said.
5463,Ms. Levinson told you she was your direct superior?,"Uh, wh-why would she say that?"
5464,"Uh, wh-why would she say that?",Can we just move on to another question?
5465,Can we just move on to another question?,"No wait, I don't understand. Who's on record on saying this?"
5466,"No wait, I don't understand. Who's on record on saying this?","With all due respect, I'm in the middle of a line of questioning. Now Mr. Scott, what did you say Ms. Levinson said? Regarding your employment status with respect to her corporate position."
5467,"With all due respect, I'm in the middle of a line of questioning. Now Mr. Scott, what did you say Ms. Levinson said? Regarding your employment status with respect to her corporate position.",Come again? That's what she said? I don't know what you're talking about.
5468,Come again? That's what she said? I don't know what you're talking about.,"Okay, if I may, he was just telling a joke before, so can we move on to another question?"
5469,"Okay, if I may, he was just telling a joke before, so can we move on to another question?","Oh, are you sure?"
5470,"Oh, are you sure?","Uh, yes."
5471,Can you go back to where this digression began?,[reading off paper] Mr. Schneider: And you were directly under her the entire time? Mr. Scott: That's what she said.
5472,[reading off paper] Mr. Schneider: And you were directly under her the entire time? Mr. Scott: That's what she said.,"Well, delivery is all wrong. She's butchering it."
5473,Did Ms. Levinson ever say why she thought she was being fired?,She thought it had to do with the twins. That's what I call them.
5474,Can you be more specific? Who are the twins?,"Um, to be delicate, they hang off milady's chest. They... make milk."
5475,She thought it had something to do with her recent breast enhancement surgery?,"Yes, and frankly, the timing was nothing short of predominant."
5476,What about your romantic relationship with Ms. Levinson? Could that have played a part in her termination?,"Well, if it did, then the company is breaking its own rules."

5478,"Okay, the company has just a few clarifying questions, Mr. Scott, if that's okay with you?",I will allow it.
5479,"That is you and Ms. Levinson in Jamaica, is that correct?",Uh-huh.
5480,"And that photograph was taken more than two months prior to this start of your relationship. Does that sound right? Mr. Scott, the timeline here is actually very important. Please, when did your relationship actually begin?","Ugh. Well, de-depends on how you define 'begin'. I mean, if it was from the first time we shook hands, that's like six years ago. If it's from the first time we kissed, that's like two years ago."
5481,"Wait, excuse me?","If it was the first time we kissed sober, it was like four months after that."
5482,Could we take a short break?,"No, uh, are you telling me that your relationship began two years ago and not in February as you previously testified to here?"

Tan almost everywhere. Jan almost everywhere. Hehe. Oh diary, what a week. I had sex with my boss. I don't know if it's going to go anywhere. Jan was very specific that this is not going anywhere, that it was a one time mistake. But we had sex six times so you tell me. I am definitely feeling very eerie.'"
5490,"Irie, sorry. 'More tomorrow. xoxo, Michael.' It would appear, that neither you nor Ms. Levinson considered you had a relationship in any sense of the word. Is that correct?",We're gonna need to see a copy of that entire journal before we proceed.
5491,"Um, can you make it eleven?","Eleven, sure. And we'll break for lunch, so everyone can have a look."
5492,"[looking for a place to sit, goes to Toby's table] Can I sit here?","[nods] ...You know, I, uh, I know a little about what you're going through in a way.

5500,"Mr. Scott, after hearing that wouldn't you say Ms. Levinson's judgment is, at least, very seriously flawed?","[stares at Diane, eyes tearing up]"

5610,Hmm?,[holds up Hunter's CD] I stole this. [Pam laughs] For you babe.
5611,"My ideals at a party? Easy. Jim. Pam. Ryan. The Mayor. Barack Obama. Shiloh Jolie-Pitt. Because at the end of the night, Brad or Angelina would have to come and pick him up and I would get to meet them. Shia La Beef because of Disturbia. Umm, all of the children of the world. Val Kilmer. But he probably wouldn't come, too famous. Obviously George Clooney. Umm... And Jan definitely, if there was room.","I'll tell you about my ideal dinner party. John Wilkes Booth. Lee Harvey Oswald. Osama Bin Laden. John Wayne Gacy. Jeffrey Lionel Dahmer. 'Oh hey guys, welcome to my home. Oh, here comes the waiter with the soup, hope you guys are hungry.'

5618,[coming up suddenly]  Are you eating?,It was just a little...
5619,"So, this girl that I basically grew up with becomes Miss West Virginia, and then suddenly, all the boys start paying attention to me.  And it was funny because, you know, I never even considered myself beautiful until people started pointing it out to me.  You know, 'Jan, wow, you are so much more beautiful than Miss West Virginia.'  [laughs]  Ah, so that is why I uh... wait, Pam, what was your, what was your question?'",Where did you grow up?
5620,Where did you grow up?,It's been a rough couple of weeks.
5621,"Wow, you did neighborhood watch?",Yes.
5622,What's that?,"I spray-painted that dog.  It was sleek, and shiny, and perfect little haircut, it was parading around like it was God's gift to this God-forsaken town [laughs] and I just couldn't take it anymore, so I went over there and I held down my knee and I just spray-painted it until I was good and done. [claps]  It bit me on the arm, [reaches out and taps Jim] I didn't even feel it."
5623,"What are you doing to him?  What... [sees neighbors' dog] is this about that stupid, ugly mutt?","She's a Weimaraner, you bitch!"
5624,"Please, please.  Don't hurt him, okay?",W.B. Jones is renovating their offices and their construction crews are taking up some of the parking spaces we used to get.
5625,[to Michael who is looking at a chair catalog] Did you pick a new chair? It's been awhile.,"Pam, when I first opened this catalog, I thought I was just going to be picking out a chair."
5626,[holding up the catalog] Have you ever seen this woman?,Her?
5627,Her?,Hmm...
5628,The one in the really great mesh black high-back swivel chair?,"Look at her smile. Those eyes, look at her eyes. She's got - I don't know what it is actually, she dresses like a professional and yet you know there is a side of her that could just curl up on a couch."
5629,"Oh, yeah, maybe, but remember after my dinner party when I said that I was swearing off women?",I definitely remember your dinner party.
5630,What is it like being single? I like it. I like starting each day with a sense of possibility. And I'm optimistic because every day I get a little more desperate and desperate situations yield the quickest results.,"Ladies and gentleman, would you please open your supply catalogs and kindly turn to page 85. [phone rings]"
5631,"[on phone] Yo, is this his new chair?","[on phone] No, he hasn't picked one yet."

5639,"Is she a dress wearer or a pants wearer? Could we share a row boat? Could, could a row boat support her?",What are you asking?
5640,What are you asking?,I think I'm being very clear what I'm asking. Would an average size row boat support her without capsizing? [silence] It bothers me that you're not answering the question.
5641,I think I'm being very clear what I'm asking. Would an average size row boat support her without capsizing? [silence] It bothers me that you're not answering the question.,"No, alright no, she can't fit in a row boat."
5642,What is wrong with these people? I would do anything for them and they're just hanging me out to dry.,"Dating shouldn't be hard for somebody like me, but it is and you know why? Because nobody here is willing to help me. Nothing would ever get done in this office without a formal request, would it? Well, fine. Here goes."

5676,[looking at the chair model's headstone] How did she die?,I guess you could say she died of blunt force trauma and blood loss. She got in a car accident and plowed into the side of an airplane hanger.

5693,"Forcing your employees to set you up is not a, uh, uh, technical violation of any Dunder Mifflin rule.  You know, but neither is forcing them to help you with a shot-by-shot remake of Indiana Jones.  Huh-how do you make a rule book like that?",Pammy?
5694,Pammy?,I don't have anybody.

5841,"Michael I have known you a very long time, and the more I've gotten to know you, the less I've come to respect you. Any other theories?","All right, you don't respect me. I accept that. But listen to me, you can't talk to me that way in this office, you just can't. I am your boss. Can't allow it."
5842,"I am good person, and sometimes, good people don't get no respect. Rodney Dangerfield. [as Rodney Dangerfield] Hey, I don't get no respect. No respect at all. When I was in the sandbox as a kid, I got not respect. My wife likes to talk after sex, so she called me from a hotel room, and said, 'I don't respect you!' Ahh, thoughtless. Aw, you know what don't get no respect? Airplane food. Why don't they just make the plane out of the airline food? My wife don't get no respect, some--take her, please, for example. [as Jeff Foxworthy] If you don't get no respect, you might be redneck. [as Borat] Respect is niiice. Borat. [as Rodney Dangerfield] What's the deal with Grapenuts? No grapes, no nuts. I don't get no respect!","So I'm thinking, as a reward for our loyal clients, that we contact their assistants, and we find out where they live. And then, we go to their houses, in the middle of the summer, and go caroling. It is a summer Christmas sale-abration. And we call it, a summer sales-a-lot. Feedback? Anybody? Stanley?"

5844,Who else is he mean to?,"Everybody.  He just, he's always, he's always talking about people behind their backs to me."
5845,What kind of stuff does Stanley say?,"Like that people are stupid, and that they're idiots, and that they're sluts."
5846,Why would he say that?,"Because he's mean.  He's, he's like a really mean-spirited guy.  He talks about how gay Oscar is..."
5847,"Oh, yeah, and then, yell at Creed, because you know what?  Looking can be as bad as touching.",Okay.
5848,Really?,"Yeah, you look like Lisa Loeb or Tina Fey or someone.  You should definitely wear them all the time."
5849,"What's it like without my glasses?  Um, well, here, I'll show you.  Unfocus your lens.  A lot.  I'm 20/400.  You got it?  Okay, I'm gonna spend the rest of the day like this.

5850,"Hi, can I help you?","Haha, nice!  I guess I have been a stranger lately."
5851,"Hey, Pam, do you want a bagel? [throws it]",Yeah.
5852,"I'm gonna go find Toby.  Oh, here's what you do.  [takes her bagel] You scoop out the middle, like that, and then you just eat the shell.  You know? [pats his belly, points to Pam]  Fewer carbs.","Yeah, if I could have seen what he just did, I think I would have gotten angry."
5853,"A formal warning, seriously?","Well, as you know, Dwight has filed a lot of complaints against you over the years."
5854,Productivity?  My numbers are good.,"I know, um, but Ryan thinks that, uh, they're not good enough."
5855,"Hey. Ready? Come on, show me excited!",Yes. [small fist-pumps from both Pam and Oscar.]
5856,"Hey, are we doing this thing?",Yup.
5857,Why are you dressed like that?,[in a dress shirt and tie] Like what?
5858,[in a dress shirt and tie] Like what?,Like you're applying for a loan.
5859,Figured I look presentable. [looks Michael over] You? [Michael dressed casually in jeans and sneakers] Went a different way.,[to Darryl] I think you look nice.
5860,What college did you go to Mike?,Let's go!

5864,"Guys, do we have to stay all day?","I mean, Michael's gone, can't we just go?"
5865,"I mean, Michael's gone, can't we just go?","Yeah, and I finished my work months ago!"
5866,"Excuse me, people. It has come to my attention, some of you have forgotten, who is in charge here. When Michael is gone... Jim is in charge. When Jim is gone, Andy and I are in charge. When Andy is gone you answer to me. Okay? [Stanley gets up to go] Excuse me where do you think you're going? Oh no, no, no. You're not leaving. No! Stanley, do not walk out that door! If you walk out that door, so help me, I will - [Stanley leaves] He left. Last time I checked, the American workday ends at five pm. You will all stay at your desks until that time. Or, you will suffer the consequences.",What consequences?
5867,What consequences?,I will tell on you.
5868,Hello. Hi. [to Pam] Can I talk to you for a sec? Excuse me.,"This is Michael, my boss. [she points] Justin."
5869,"How you doing? Listen, I don't think that a handsome, funny, smart, funny-looking kid like you, should limit himself. You could do whatever you want to do. You could be a classy janitor, or a cashier with dignity, or a... migraine worker. [takes back the info flyer Justin holds] Maybe for you, paper should be more of a hobby.",Sorry for wasting your time.
5870,Are you mental?,"Michael, do you remember, you specifically told me to only bring one sheet of paper? You said it only takes one sheet to make a difference. And I said, 'Are you sure Michael?' And you said 'Pam! Pam! Pam!' And then you sneezed in my tea, and then you said, 'Don't worry, it's just allergies.' Do you remember that?"
5871,"Michael, do you remember, you specifically told me to only bring one sheet of paper? You said it only takes one sheet to make a difference. And I said, 'Are you sure Michael?'

5872,"Hey, so how's the direct mail business going?","I can't complain, people love their junk mail."
5873,Now are you getting all your paper from PPC? Or-,"You know what Jim? I'm not really looking to change things up right now, I just came out here to get out of the office for a little bit, so why don't we just play, okay?"
5874,"You know what Jim? I'm not really looking to change things up right now, I just came out here to get out of the office for a little bit, so why don't we just play, okay?","Absolutely, will do."
5875,What is this company?,"Well it's funny that you should ask, because it's really more than a company..."
5876,"Say, we're gonna ditch this bitch. You in?",No.
5877,"Are you out? [Angela hangs up] Pumpkin's out, let's go gang! [they all make a run for the door, Dwight re-enters room with only Angela left]","My old art room. [finds a sheet of blank paper] Oh, maybe it's still here! [looks for her painting] No. No they must have taken it down. Never mind."
5878,[answers cell] What do you want?,"Michael, I know you're swamped. I just thought you should know that everyone in the office has left, except for Angela and I. Do not worry though, I have taken down their names, and I have docked them a personal day."
5879,"Who cares? I'm not there, Jim's not there, why should they have to be there?",So... what else is up? [Michael hangs up] Mich-

5885,Talk to you later?,"Yeah. All right. Bye. [Kevin sinks putt] All right. Sorry, I got to annoy you one more time. What if I bring down shipping costs?"
5886,"Yeah. All right. Bye. [Kevin sinks putt] All right. Sorry, I got to annoy you one more time. What if I bring down shipping costs?","You can try. But I've looked at your prices. Even with free shipping? Doesn't work. It's just- it's not in the stars, Jim. [Phil sinks putt] Six."

5888,"All of these jobs? Suck. I would rather live jobless, on a beach somewhere, off the money from a large inheritance, than to have to work in any one of these crap-holes. They suck.","Hey! [walks up to Oscar and Darryl tossing basketballs, grabs Oscar's ball] Game over. [kicks the ball up to the gymnasium ceiling]"
5889,Just-in case. What's your last name?,Polznik.
5890,This... just in. Justin Polznik! Huh?,"Justin is the ugly girl in the movie, who takes off her glasses and she's hot!  And you realize she was always hot, she was just wearing glasses. And that you were the blind one. He's the most... important thing in my life right now."
5891,"This is Darryl Philbin. Isn't he big? And you already met her, Pam Beesly, office hottie. She will 'do' you. [laughs] No, no. But she has already dated two guys in the office, that we know of, so, this could be number three, you never know?",Excuse me.
5892,"Why, why wouldn't you say that to her face?","So, what do you think? Think these guys are nice? The guys I didn't bring are even better. Justin, I'm willing to commit right now. Would you do me the honor, of spending the summer with us, at Dunder Mifflin? I think, I think you are very special."
5893,"So, what do you think? Think these guys are nice? The guys I didn't bring are even better. Justin, I'm willing to commit right now.

If you can hear me, I'd like you to look around at all these companies and know that none of them are good enough for you. H&R Block? Come on, I mean I don't even know what they do. Frank Regan Funeral Home? Too much formaldehyde! The Air Force? [Airforce recruiter glares at Michael] Air Force is cool. The refreshments? Bush league! You know, that's not what you want. Dunder- they,  well, okay I see security is coming so I just want to say, come to Dunder Mifflin. Dunder Mifflin, a great place to work! Anybody? Show of hands, anybody want to intern at Dunder Mifflin?  We do not offer college credit, we cannot give you any sort of pay, but it is a really fun work environment. Anybody? Show of hands? Damn... it. Okay, I'm gonna wrap it up here. Thank you for your time, and drive safe.","[Dwight and Angela exiting, he opens door for her] Thank you."

5900,Yeah. Can I fill out an application?,"Oh absolutely, here, take a seat. I should let you know right away, this is just an entry-level job. It's really basic. We're looking for like, a self starter, someone who can meet deadlines, who just pretty much just go the extra mile, I guess."
5901,"So, what is your poison?  You like uh, sales, accounting, customer service, what do you like...","Sales, uh, sales would be cool."
5902,"Hey, Pam, what's up?","Check that out, huh?"
5903,"Check that out, huh?","Hi, nice to meet you."
5904,"That's called card stock.  That's what you're feeling.  Now what you're feeling inside is confusion, butterflies, exhilaration... You're thinking, 'Am I good enough for this job?

5905,Are you sure?,"Mmm, yeah."

6004,What is it?,I am going to give Toby...
6005,Your watch?,"...Yes, I am. That was it. How did you know that?"
6006,"...Yes, I am. That was it. How did you know that?",I just knew.
6007,How did you know?,Oh that is so sweet.
6008,Is that the police?,Yes.
6009,Would you do me a favor and connect me to Ryan?,Absolutely. [dials and hands Jim receiver]
6010,"[clears throat] Right to voicemail. [into phone] Hey, Ryan, it's Jim. You know what? Totally disregard that last voicemail, because you obviously have your hands tied. Good luck! [hangs up]",What's protocol on this?
6011,What's protocol on this?,"I normally do nothing, I guess. No, you shouldn't- [Holly knocks on Michael's door]"
6012,"Michael, are you okay?",[voice straining] I'm just worried about my friend.
6013,Stop. You can let yourself be upset. He's your friend. You know what I usually find?...,"Holly is sweet and simple, like a lady baker. I would not be surprised to find out that she had worked in a bakery before coming here. She has that kind of warmth. I'm pretty sure she's baked on a professional level."
6014,"No antigravity machine, huh?","Sorry, Michael, I don't think they're real."
6015,"Yeah, who'd have thought? [Pam sees fireworks being set up; smiles]","Is Jim gonna propose tonight? He is, isn't he? No, he's not... Is he?"
6016,"Is Jim gonna propose tonight? He is, isn't he? No, he's not... Is he?","Oh, it was a pretty good company, but I just couldn't see a future there. They kept hiring from the outside. It was easy to get in but impossible to rise up."
6017,You have it?,Almost. [she unlocks Holly's car]
6018,Hey. What are you doing?,[Mose drops cage and runs] Mose!
6019,What the hell is going on here?!,N-nothing you need to know the details of.
6020,Why did you do that?,It was playful hazing.
6021,"No. There is no such thing as playful hazing. Dwight, I want you to look at Holly right now. Everybody, I want you to look at Holly right now, and maybe if you look at her deeply enough, you will see what I see in her. And that is that we are all very lucky to have her here. Holly is the best thing that has happened to this company since World War II. Fifty years, she is the best. [to Dwight] Take care of that, all right?",It's not rabid.
6022,"Did you see that! Did you see it? Did you see what... wow-wee! Uh, well, Jan didn't believe in showing affection, so... sometimes I don't know how to react when a girl touches me. Oh... I like it! [giggles]","Hey Mrs. Vance, we're all out!"
6023,Cool! You drive your own car?,Yup. This is my car. Do you drive your own car?
6024,Yup. This is my car. Do you drive your own car?,Yep. Just like you.
6025,"[on microphone] Alright! Let's hear it for Darryl and his band. [applause] You know what? Let's also give a shout-out to Phyllis for this awesome party, huh?","[everyone applauds] Yay, Phyllis!"
6026,"Probably the best one that we have ever had, right? [cheers and applause] But the real reason that we are here, is to say goodbye to a guy who we will probably never ever see again. Now, a lot of you know that I am an accomplished songwriter.",Song parody writer.
6027,"I love to sing them, but I am not going to be doing that today. I am going to be doing something I wrote specifically for Toby. [to band] Do you know, um, 'Goodbye Stranger'? Supertramp?",Yeah. [music starts]
6028,"Oh, okay. Yeah. Well, actu-too soon. It's uh, it's uh, very sexual. [cell phone rings] Sorry. Kevin. [answers] Kevin, where are you? You missed my song, buddy.","Yeah, Michael, I'm at Gerrity's. You have to come down here."
6029,What is it?,Just hurry. [hangs up]
6030,Is he okay?,Yeah. He's at the supermarket and he needs me.
6031,"Yeah, that's true. Don't move a muscle. I will be back momentarily, all right? [Holly freezes; Michael laughs] No, you can drink-you can finish your drink and then I'll-okay, I'll be back.",Well it was good to see you.
6032,"Wow, Kevin, really? We're- [to Jan] Sorry. We're in the middle of a party. [to Kevin] Is this why you called me down here?","Yeah, Michael, I just uh..."
6033,Wow. I can't believe it! Look at you! [Jan laughs] Are you nauseous?,No.
6034,"Do you-do you have cravings? You never touched my Propecea, or my Accutane, did you?","Uh, no."
6035,Why?,"Because you're pregnant, and because it obviously happened when we were together. And, I am very..."
6036,You cheated on me... when I specifically asked you not to?,"...Not to. No, I did not. I did not cheat on you.  I did not."
6037,You did?,Yuh-huh.
6038,When we were going out?,"Uh, yeah."
6039,You'd rather have somebody else's sperm than my sperm?,"No, no no... it's not just any sperm bank. I mean, it's really... this is a really, really great place. It's amazing, actually. I'm gonna bring you the catalogue. You should look through it. It's... and it's-in fact, it's right next to that little breakfast place that you like in the city where you can draw on the tables."
6040,"[on microphone] Can I have your attention please? [music stops] I was waiting for the right time to do this, and I can't think of a better time than right now, with the music playing, and all our friends around, and fireworks going off... My parents are here! Andrew and Ellen Bernard. Thank you for sharing in this joyous moment. Miss Angela Martin, will you please join me onstage? [Angela shakes her head 'no'] Okay, then I will come to you, my flower. [knocks over Darryl's keyboard]",Unh! Damn it!
6041,"Angela, will you do me the honor... of giving me your tiny hand in marriage? [shows her a ring]",...Okay.
6042,Can I be your bridesmaid?,No.
6043,"Sure. Meredith, do you mind?",[hands Meredith his camera] This one right here.
6044,Yeah?,"Yeah, Andy proposed to one of your accountants."
6045,"Oh, um, well, you know what? You should go to the Glider Diner. Ask Stanley about that. Practically lives there.",Okay.
6046,"Yeah, it was a good day. I mean, first days are always the hardest, right? Well, I should go. [Kevin is waiting in the car] I gotta buckle him in.",Well this is it. I am here to see you off.
6047,"Thanks... [Hank is standing next to Michael] Really, Michael?",Sorry. Corporate policy.
6048,What? [turns and sees Phyllis; Phyllis gasps and drops the box in her hands],This is Jim Halpert...
6049,"He didn't mention me, did he?","Oh, no, he said you were a really good salesman."
6050,Pretend?  Or really make one?,Really make one.
6051,"Will you please?  Make a sandwich.  Now, according to my sources, you have an issue with the new H.R. woman.  Well, so do I.  And so does our secret benefactor.  That's too much peanut butter.  What I propose is a good old-fashioned hazing, and I need your help.  If you choose to accept this mission...Wipe the knife off before you stick it in the jelly.  Have you ever made a sandwich before?  Dammit, Meredith!","[on phone] Well, who can do a party of this size?  But you're in the business, you must surely know of some other businesses.  Okay, well, I JUST WANT A DAMN DANCE FLOOR!  Sorry. So sorry, I shouldn't have sworn, I'm so sorry.  Um, thanks for your time. [knock on door]  What?  Sorry, I shouldn't have said 'what' like that, it was really rude."
6052,"[on phone] Well, who can do a party of this size?  But you're in the business, you must surely know of some other businesses.  Okay, well, I JUST WANT A DAMN DANCE FLOOR!  Sorry.

6056,Good one? [Toby puts on the lens cover and scurries away awkwardly] That's a cool camera.,"Okay, this is the second time in two days that the website isn't working.  Do you guys know anything about it?"
6057,"Okay, this is the second time in two days that the website isn't working.  Do you guys know anything about it?","The website is hiding, forming alliances with other sites, preparing an attack for which we will have no defense."
6058,Do you honestly believe that?,"Yes, I do."
6059,"Is Ryan gonna fire me?  I don't know.  I know that I've done everything I can, and I just brought in a huge sale, and... am I insane, or was this kid a temp two years ago?  Because in the three years that he's been here, I think all he's ever done is start a fire and grow a beard.  And it's not even a good beard.","Troy Undercook, for Michael."
6060,Troy!  What are you doing here?,"Just filling in for Ryan, as a favor."
6061,Where is Ryan?,He had an urgent matter in New York.
6062,Can I get you a tankard of mead?,"Hey, Troy, can you do me a huge favor?  Next time you see Ryan, can you tell him to check his messages?  That'd be great."
6063,"Hey, Troy, can you do me a huge favor?  Next time you see Ryan, can you tell him to check his messages?  That'd be great.","If I see him, I'll tell him."
6064,Why wouldn't you see him?  You work for him.,I report to Wallace now.
6065,"Okay, what's going on?",Looks serious.
6066,"Troy, do you know anything about this?",Maybe I do.
6067,"And if the food stations are here and here... no!  Here and here.  Drinks here, then people can mingle.  But then where would the band go?","Mmm.  Well, what about there?"
6068,"Mmm.  Well, what about there?","Mmm, no Bob, I don't know."
6069,Why don't we eat more corn dogs?  They're delicious.,"Totally, they're the best."

6071,"Seriously, do you like my idea?  Corn burgers.",I need you to make an announcement that this party is a disaster.
6072,Deep fried Twinkies?  It's gross!,Is that what that is?

That is so good.","When I had my colitis, Toby was very helpful.  He gave me seven weeks off.  When I had my acid reflux, Toby was not as helpful.  So I'm mixed on Toby."

6076,"[smiles, looks to Michael]  Really, nothing?","2,336 pounds. Y'all need to learn some portion control."

6078,Really? 'Cause I haven't eaten anything since noon on Friday.,"OK. [holds elevator] Stanley, come on."
6079,Did you see Holly's butt?,"No, I didn't. [Michael laughs] You know why?"
6080,"No, I didn't. [Michael laughs] You know why?",Why?
6081,Why?,"Because most of the time, friends don't talk about other friends' butts."
6082,But what have you learned about her?,I learned that she broke her left leg twice in one year. I learned that she's allergic to sesame seeds. I learned that she has read 'Lonesome Dove' three times.
6083,Also -- and no pressure -- the teacher? He's a catch.,"Actually, I'm a lesbian."
6084,What's the joke?,There is no joke. I just said it because I haven't had much luck lately and I'm not really looking to date. Maybe I should switch to women.
6085,"Oh, you think it's a choice?","Um, I'm gonna head back to my work area and just--"

6091,"Why haven't I proposed yet? Uh, actually Pam and I talked about it. And we just decided that, um -- well, we didn't want to spend first three months of our engagement apart. And Pam's always said she doesn't want a long engagement. Something in her past, I guess. I'm not really sure of the whole story, but something about a guy who used to work here...","OK, no, no, no, no, no, no. Same places as last week."

6106,"Oh, calm down, weirdo. It's just a joke. She's such a weirdo! You know what? My real beef with her, though, Pam? She can't find those little colored paper clips that I like so much. Will you help her find them, please?",They're on the supply shelf.
6107,"New York is so exciting. I love my classes. The city's awesome. Um, can you give me back to Jim now, please?","OK, everybody, let's suck in our guts."

6154,"No, no, no, NO, no!  You know what?  Fat people are not monsters!  Why don't you guys have a little more sensitivity to the subject.  Bang!  Boom!  Case in point!

6155,"Hey!  Why don't you just sit down, please?","Eh, I've been sitting all day."

6157,Why?,[at a loss for words]
6158,Why should I have to thank him?,"You're right, you're right.  Just, Dwight, do it.  Just say it ok."
6159,"Finally.  Right?  Ok, Phyllis you must be exhausted from standing on those gams.  Why don't you have a seat?  [Phyllis sits] Let's all clap at Phyllis. [everyone claps] Ok!  [in Michael Clump voice]  When Michael Clump wants to remind you [normal voice] that corporate... their idea, yes, was to urge you to lose weight, but more importantly what this whole thing is about, this contest is really about being healthy.  And in order to be healthy, you have to eat, Kelly.  Kelly.

What makes her beautiful?",[stands up] Everything.  She's perfect.

6163,"Kelly, will you just agree to stop this mess and stop trying to kill yourself?","I hate dieting, I hate it so much.  I hate this worm inside of me!"
6164,Summers going great.  Just spent two hours listening to Michael Clump.  I have a weird pain in my left side that I'm convinced is an ulcer.  My girlfriend lives in New York and I haven't seen her in 10 days.  How's your summer?,"Hey Ryan, look.  Shaved off my goatee.  I am goateeless.  We are the goateeless brothers."
6165,How was Friday night?,"Oh, I had a good time, but it's been three days and no call.  I even have two tickets to see Counting Crows for tonight, so..."

6174,Really?,No.
6175,And you know what?  I even got two tickets to see the Counting Crows tonight as a surprise.  Why do guys not call when they say they are gonna call?,"I dunno.  I always call everybody back right away.  He'll call back though.  Give him until the end of the day, he'll call.  If he doesn't, he is loco."
6176,"Wait, do we have until the end of the day?","So we're only eight pounds behind Utica.  Now, I know it's a stretch but we could weigh ourselves again at the end of the day and maybe win this thing after all."
6177,"[Kelly eating in the break room] Hey, is that healthy food?",Nope.
6178,"We're trying to win a contest here, Kelly.  Please?","Hey, Michael.  I just scheduled lunch with a client so I might be back a little late."
6179,"Ok, that is fine.  Just water, and be back by weigh-in, ok?",Perfect.

[checks watch] You know what?  That's a good place to end it.  Right there.  This, I think, was a great ethics seminar.  She has given us a lot of wonderful things to think about.  Right... what is wrong.  Who's to say?  Really.  In the end.  I mean because it is... unknowable.  But, let's give her a round of applause.  Holly, everybody.  Holly!  Get back to work.

6241,Am I in trouble here or something?,"No... no, this is just a stupid formality."
6242,"No, it's not a formality.  Now, were these, um, meet-ups just personal?  Unrelated to business?","Nah, I wouldn't have done it if it wasn't for the discount paper.  There's not a lot of fruit in those looms."
6243,"What I don't understand is... why the steak coupons?  I mean, if you were already getting the discounted paper?","Well it's funny.  Maybe it's a girl thing, but after we did it, and he would give me those coupons, I just felt good about myself. [Holly begins to write in her notebook] Hey what's going on here?  I thought I had immunity?"
6244,"Well it's funny.  Maybe it's a girl thing, but after we did it, and he would give me those coupons, I just felt good about myself. [Holly begins to write in her notebook] Hey what's going on here?  I thought I had immunity?",Well unfortunately immunity or something being off the record does not really exist in the workplace.

6251,Here too.  You know what my favorite season is?,Maybe we should talk about Meredith first.
6252,"By any chance, did you see Battlestar Galactica last night?","No, I did not.  Was that any good?"
6253,"No, I did not.  Was that any good?",Actually not.  It was really so-so.

6255,Is that anything like the original Battlestar Galactica?,"You know, it's weird.  It's practically a shot for shot remake."
6256,"Really? [Dwight closes his eyes, clutches the paper in his hands] Huh, that's cool.",Story's kinda bland.  It's about this guy named Dumbledore Calrissian who needs to return the ring back to Mordor.
6257,Really?  That doesn't sound right.,"I just don't want my employees thinking that their jobs depend on performance.  I mean, what sort of place is that to call home?  And Meredith needs this job.  This is her main source of money."

6265,"How do you tell somebody that you care about deeply, 'I told you so.'  Gently with a rose?  In a funny way, like it's a hilarious joke?  Or do you just let it go, because saying it would just make things worse? ... Probably the funny way.","Can I have everyone's attention?  Excuse me, may I have everyone's attention, please.  We need to finish the ethics seminar."
6266,"Can I have everyone's attention?  Excuse me, may I have everyone's attention, please.  We need to finish the ethics seminar.","No way, lady."

6269,"Wait a second, how does the steak factor in again?","I think she got it as a tip, but I don't know why she didn't just take cash."
6270,That's a big ethical area?,"Listen, I would love to have an honest conversation with management about ethics.  Why isn't the company doing better?  Mmm... it could be the pad of Post-its I took home last week.  Or it could be the twelve million dollars in deferred compensation in stock options they paid the CEO for a year of substandard performance.  I'm sure we'll cover both in the seminar."

6279,"Look, I feel you okay?  That guy took no responsibility for his actions.","But are, are you gonna pay for my mirror?"
6280,"But are, are you gonna pay for my mirror?",If I have to answer for everything that guy did... [shakes head] I'm never gonna move on.
6281,"Hey, anybody see a pair of sunglasses?","Umm... I think I saw some in the kitchen. [toaster oven bell rings, Ryan opens it as smoke rolls out and he see's his melted sunglasses on the tray, Ryan takes cooked sunglasses to Kevin] Oh! I didn't do that.

6282,What are we gonna do?,About what?
6283,About what?,Holly.  She's on the warpath.  She is gunning for all our jobs.  Do you guys have any dirt on her?

6285,"Stanley, didn't she say a bunch of racist stuff to you?","No, that was you."
6286,"Hey, how did it go?","Oh, cr..., oh, God.  Meredith, you know what?  I just need a minute, okay?"

6301,"Damnit, Phyllis!  I'm sorry.  [more softly] Damnit, Phyllis.  It was hard enough to convince Jan to come.  So are we set for refreshments?","Per your instructions, we have the personalized M&Ms with the baby names.  This is your boy bowl, with the name 'Chevy.' And this is the girl bowl, with M&Ms with the name 'Astird.'"
6302,"I know.  I know.  It is beautiful.  No.  Thank you.  Is this it? I mean, is this... Two bowls of M&Ms and some balloons?  You know what Phyllis, I think you need to step it up.  I think you need to get the lead out.  Because if I'm not mistaken, we gave you your wedding shower here.  We all came into this room and gave you a golden shower.  Well you know what, where's my golden shower, Phyllis?","It does not matter to me at all whether this baby is biologically mine.  I am going to love it. It's like when the dog nurses the tiger cub.

It's like farm aid, but instead of farms fighting against AIDS, it is us fighting against our own poverty."
6402,"Okay, I'm gonna have to stop you right there. Was this a sorority that you didn't get into a real sorority so you had to kind of form your own?","Move on, Michael."
6403,"So, in order to recoup the value of items we liked, we have to spend more money on things we don't want. Who would ever come to this?","I don't know, it could be any number of people.

6445,Have you asked her what she wants to do?,"Well, I thought as the man that I should make the decision."
6446,"Our first date was at the Anthracite Coal Museum.  We had both been before, but we pretended like it was our first time so we could get all the extra information.  They knew we were faking... 'cause they recognized us.   But we made them tell us all the stories.  All the safety information.  And we corrected them whenever they got it wrong.

6454,"Breaker one-nine, copy?","Oh, copy that breaker. Those Duke boys are at it again."
6455,"It's been a weird week since we found out I had to transfer. Michael wanted me to quit and get some job here in Scranton, and I said 'Well, why don't you quit and get some job in Nashua?' And he said 'I asked you first.'  And I said 'First!' at the same time he did. And then I said 'Jinx.' And then we never talked about it again and haven't been back to the conversation. So...","All right everybody. I'm out of here. Jim, you're in charge."
6456,Thought I'd go casual today. Morning everyone. Good morning.  Hello.  How are you Phyllis?,Ha ha ha. That's funny. [angrily] Take that sweatshirt off!  Hey buddy.
6457,"Remember when I jokingly yelled at you to take your sweatshirt off? Totally joking. But, you should know, those colors are sacred. Not that I care. But if you're not a Cornell man, you probably shouldn't wear them.","No I get it. I totally understand. And uh, I just want to assure you, that I mean no disrespect. You see, I'm applying!"
6458,"Come on, you think you can get into Cornell?","Well if somebody who barely out-sells Phyllis, can get in, I should be fine."

6461,"I asked Tom and Pete to come early so we could play a prank on Jim at lunch! Pretty awesome, right? I think they're into the idea. They're probably thinking, 'That Pam Beasly, she's the coolest sister-in-law on the planet. She's the best! The absolute best.'","Okay, so here's what I'm thinking. I'm gonna say that before ceramics class, I took off my ring, and then when I changed back out of my smock, it wasn't in my pocket anymore, and I lost it."
6462,That's perfect. You know what would be even more hilarious? Remember that thing we did when Jim was in high school with his girlfriend?,"Right! That would be hilarious! We should totally dog her, about being an artist, never making any money!"
6463,"So, not the ring then? The- the- Not doing the ring?",I think this is better.
6464,You were sleeping?  You were talking before.,Was I?  Really? Was I saying anything interesting?
6465,Was I?  Really? Was I saying anything interesting?,Not really.
6466,"All right. What's the scoop, how far?",Four hours. Almost halfway there.

6473,"No, Darryl did not touch me. Can we just keep going, please? [crying]",What's the matter?
6474,What's the matter?,It's not gonna work.
6475,"Holly thinks that this relationship is over. Well, you know what? I am not gonna give up that easy. I'm gonna make this way harder than it needs to be.",Take that down. [Dwight has hung a large red Cornell banner from the ceiling]
6476,Excuse me?,Take. That down.

6482,Years?  Of just a few hours every weekend?,"Here's my wish. I want you to meet a great guy, and I want you to be happy."
6483,"So Pam, how much does an artist make after they leave art school?","Yeah, not a lot of money in the arts, right?"
6484,"Yeah, not a lot of money in the arts, right?",That's not really true. There's a lot of things you can do with an art degree actually.
6485,"Wow, that's- that's a little rude. What's your deal?","Hey, just having fun Jimmy."
6486,Yeah. Right Pam?,Yup! [Tom and Pete give Halpertian looks to camera]
6487,"You know what? I think we're a great couple. I think we're a classic couple. I think we're like Romeo and Juliet. I think we... go together so well.  We're like peanut butter and jelly, don't you think?","I do, I think so."
6488,Please?,You'll be okay
6489,What?,Dwight!
6490,"Andy, I've been meaning to ask you, which a cappella group should I join? The Harmoniacs, or the Do-Re-Mi-Go's?","Hm. Assuming you had the voice to be in any of them, it's irrelevant. Because I called admissions and it looks like I, will be conducting your university interview."
6491,"Yeah. Big one. So, should I not let you in now, or do you want to do the interview, and then I won't let you in?",[thinks] Interview.
6492,What?,The conference room!
6493,Who are your role models?,"If I had to put Dwight's chances into a percentage, I would say he has none percent chance."

6503,"Well, I'll be the judge of that. What do you got?","Okay. I lost my engagement ring in ceramics class. Left it in my smock. I had this whole thing where I go back to class, wrongly accuse another girl. Look I even used makeup to put a ring around my finger, you can hardly see it, it's very subtle."
6504,Oh. Hey how about at Thanksgiving we prank Tom about being bald?,This is the last of it.
6505,You're not staying?,"You know I have some things I need to do this weekend. I just remembered, so, I'll just ride back with you."
6506,I'll be down in just a second. [into house] Holly?,So um... I think I'm gonna go back with Darryl [Holly hugs Michael] Okay. [they kiss goodbye.] Goodbye.

6514,"I don't know if it'll be shorter to fly. [Holly gasps] You have to drive to Boston, right? That's an hour and a half. Get there an hour before the flight. Now you're up two and a half hours. The flight to Philadelphia is an hour fifteen. It's another two and a half hour drive to Scranton, assuming there's no traffic, because....","[interrupting Oscar] Well, I just want to say goodbye.

6537,Why are you doing this to Andy?,"You once told me that Andy and I had different strengths. Well, he can't do what I can do. I can get into Cornell, but he doesn't know how to make food and shelter from a golden retriever."

6546,"Uh, Pam. What do you want on your coffee?",Sprinkle of cinnamon.
6547,What does it say?,"Dwight, your feedback is horrible."
6548,"Wait, is this a joke? I'm getting that queasy feeling that sometimes accompanies jokes.",Do I look like I am joking?
6549,Do I look like I am joking?,"No, but that's sometimes part of it."
6550,"If I were joking, you would be laughing. Do you look like you are laughing?",Impossible to say. I can't see myself.
6551,"Yo, Tommy Tuna, did you get your scores yet?",Nope.
6552,How can you even be sure?,It has my face on it.

6556,How was your meeting with Michael?,None of your business.
6557,Was it your scores?,"Those can't be my scores, Jim. For your information --"
6558,What do you think I am saying to you?!,I'm not talking to you.
6559,"[on phone] Would you be able to do the same design, but with walls of gray? And a top that's gray too? Fabulous.","Oh, come on."
6560,What?,You too?
6561,You too?,Did my scores drop a little?
6562,Did my scores drop a little?,"Jim, they are a poopy. [Jim coughs, presses button to end call on Bluetooth]"
6563,[touches ear] Jim? Jim?,Are we even sure that's my file?
6564,Are we even sure that's my file?,"No. [glances at it] Yes, I am sure, Jim. It --"
6565,"Here's what's going to happen. I am going to have to fix you, manage you two on a more personal scale, a more micro form of management. Jim, what is that called?",Microgement.
6566,[picks up phone] Hello?,"Hello, this is Dwight Schrute from the Dunder Mifflin Paper Company."

6571,"What? No, but I --","Hello? [laughs] No, I'm just on the phone with this stupid salesman. He's so dumb. Probably just gonna keep him on the line forever and not buy anything. Yeah, OK. [punches button on phone]"

6579,Do you have a specific place in mind?,No. But anything within a five- to eight-mile radius is acceptable.

6585,Who stands to benefit from our downfall?,"The mob, maybe NASA."
6586,Is there some evidence?,"[on Bluetooth] Ooh, cute shoes online."
6587,How many shoes do you need?,"I don't know. Two, maybe three if one wears out. How many shoes do you need?"
6588,"I don't know. Two, maybe three if one wears out. How many shoes do you need?",I'm not talking to you.
6589,Who are you talking to?,Pam.
6590,I'm sorry?,Shh. Do you hear that?
6591,Shh. Do you hear that?,Hear what?
6592,Hear what?,Breathing. Is that you?
6593,Breathing. Is that you?,"Well, I am breathing, yes."
6594,"Well, stop. Hold your breath. I still hear it. Who's there? Kelly, is that you? Hold on. [puts down phone and runs away]",I need paper.
6595,Hear anything interesting?,What are you talking about?
6596,What are you talking about?,[laughs] I think you know.
6597,"What are you up to, girl? Huh? Phyllis put you up to this? Stanley? Are they paying you?",Are you accusing me of something?
6598,Are you accusing me of something?,"Of course I am. I know you're the mastermind, but you're too stupid to do it by yourself."
6599,"Hey, how are you and Darryl?","Um, we're cool. [gets up to leave] Bye."
6600,What was?,Have you ever had a conversation with Kelly where she didn't go on for 15 minutes without taking a breath?

6602,Did you do something to her?,I don't think so.
6603,"Hey, how's things?",All right.
6604,Yeah?,Living in the moment.
6605,Do you have any reason to believe that Kelly would be mad at me?,"I don't play the politics game anymore, Jim. Can I tell you something? I played it full on in New York. I played it high stakes. For keeps. Made it to the top. But look what it cost. [takes sip of coffee] Can I tell you what else I learned?"
6606,"I don't play the politics game anymore, Jim. Can I tell you something? I played it full on in New York. I played it high stakes. For keeps. Made it to the top. But look what it cost. [takes sip of coffee] Can I tell you what else I learned?","Wait, that's pretty weird."
6607,What?,"Well, Andy has a mug just like that."
6608,"Oh, yeah, Kelly gave them out as party favors. Remember? You got one.",No. What party?
6609,No. What party?,Her America's Got Talent finale party over the summer. [Jim makes face] That's crazy. It was packed. I thought everyone was there. You were there. I remember you being there.
6610,I wasn't. But thank you. [to Pam] Do you know anything about this party?,"Yes, I said you definitely should go, but you wanted to visit me instead."
6611,Is that it?,No. Why? No. [puts it in desk drawer and slams it shut]
6612,No. Why? No. [puts it in desk drawer and slams it shut],"OK, I'm gonna assume that was it. Here's the thing: I think you're right. I think it was Kelly. I think she's mad at us for not coming to her party."
6613,"Oh, man, I knew it. Who are her co-conspirators?",Probably just Kelly.
6614,Yeah. What?,You were right.
6615,What's going on?,Why don't you tell us?
6616,Why don't you tell us?,Nothing's going on.
6617,What? I -- I don't know what you're talking about. This is the first I'm hearing about this.,"Oh, come on. You juked the stats, cupcake."
6618,What's going on?,"I love your tie, Michael."
6619,"OK,  all right. OK, I did it. All right? I lied, whatever. Just fire me. But you know what? I did it because you guys didn't come to my party, and you said you would try to and then you didn't even show up, and so you're bad friends.",We have our confession. I'm calling security. [reaches for phone]
6620,"Don't. Don't. Get away from that, Dwight, please. You know what? She's got a point about you two. You do have a problem dealing with people.",See? I wasn't lying.
6621,See? I wasn't lying.,You were lying.
6622,"I have an enormous amount of trouble trying to get people to come to my place. And I hate it. I can't tell you how much leftover guacamole I have ended up eating over the years. I don't even know why I make it in such great quantities. Here's what we're gonna do. We are going to sit here for a while, make it look good. And maybe you should cry. Can you make yourself cry?",No problem.
6623,Pam Beesley?,"Hey, what are you doing here?"
6624,"Hey, what are you doing here?",Who's that?
6625,Who's that?,It's Alex.
6626,"Oh, that's gonna be great. Who's Chuck Close?","Oh, I love Chuck Close and his photo-realist paintings. But I have to work."
6627,"Uh, well, actually there's something else I'd love to talk to you about. Can we go somewhere else to talk about it?",OK.
6628,What's up?,I'm gonna take a big leap and I want to tell you that I think you should not move back to Scranton.
6629,Why did you come to New York in the first place?,"Because they have a great design program, and I wanted to see if I was any good at it. And I wanted to work on my art, too."
6630,"Right. And that's why I think that you should stay here. Because I mean, you -- really you just got here, you know? You can't do New York in three months. You know, it has everything. It has -- all the opportunity is here. All the -- the whole art scene is in New York. You know, it would be nuts to go back to Scranton without getting to fully experience it.",Jim's in Scranton.
6631,Is that the Matsuhashi B-400? The world's tiniest Bluetooth? [reaches toward Jim's ear] May I?,Don't.
6632,"Well, then. Why don't you look over some of our materials? [opens album]",Oh. Hmm.
6633,"Um, what are we talking price wise?",You already said deal.
6634,"Come on, how did you propose? Spill it. Were you wasted?","How did I propose, let me see... well, I drove her up to Nashua, and I had the ring, a big 10-carat diamond; it was beautiful. And I got down on my hands and knees, and a shooting star crossed overhead, and it just lit up the diamond like a shooting star. And we were in a restaurant, and I put the diamond into a cheeseburger."
6635,"And she took a bite, started to choke. So what do I do? I have CPR training. Go around, start doing the Heimlich.",Perfect.
6636,"So, how you holdin' up?",I'm pretty much devastated.
6637,You know what you should do? Take a vacation.,"Maybe go to Sandals, Jamaica. Or the other Sandals, Jamaica. I just don't want to go by myself."
6638,"Why are surveys important? Okay, hypothetical: A man wants to buy 500 reams of....carrots. And, so he's like 'What do I do? Where do I go? Do I go to the insensitive carrot supplier, the insensitive carrot salesman? Or do I go to the nice carrot salesman, who will maybe charge a few cents more per ream of carrot, but guarantee next-day delivery on your carrots? Most companies need their carrots the next day. Now, substitute paper for carrots, and that is why surveys are important.'","Great marks, Phyllis. [Phyllis walks out of Michael's office smiling]"
6639,"What do I do with my bonus check? [scoffs] Simple. Purchase paper from myself. Boosts my sales, which boosts my bonus. Last year I bought even more paper to make this year's bonus even bigger. Eventually, I'll get a bonus so big I can retire on it. And I'll use the paper to write my memoirs.","I taught Jim and Dwight everything I know about sales. But there are certain things that cannot be taught, and it is these things that I now must teach them."
6640,"My job is to manipulate the customer into buying paper. In return, they give me money. I am the predator and they are the prey. Would a mouse give a positive review to a hawk? Should the hawk even care? [sighs heavily, nearly starts to cry] Excuse me, I've got work to do.",[laughs heartily and passes a newspaper to Phyllis]
6641,"Hey, what are you laughing at?",[continue to laugh]
6642,Are you laughing at me?,We're laughing at this cartoon! [passes newspaper to Dwight]
6643,"Perfect, isn't it?",[looks at cartoon] How is that funny? What are you really laughing at? Huh?
6644,[looks at cartoon] How is that funny? What are you really laughing at? Huh?,Haven't you been following the news? Ther university is using its non-profit status to fund its private real estate investments.
6645,Haven't you been following the news? Ther university is using its non-profit status to fund its private real estate investments.,[laughing louder] And he really nailed them on it. Somebody's finally holding them accountable!
6646,Did you know that in Morocco it is common to exchange a small gift when meeting somebody for the first time?  In Japan you must always commit suicide to avoid embarrassment.  In Italy you must always wash your hands after going to the bathroom.  This is considered to be polite.,Why are you telling us this?
6647,Why are you telling us this?,I am jetting off on an international business trip.

6659,"Dwight, can you get those please?",[sighs and picks up Michael's empty suitcases]
6660,That good?,Mmmm...
6661,You want one of your own? I can hook you up.,I'm sorry.  You'll need to keep moving.
6662,I made egg salad sandwiches. Do you want one? [holds up sandwich],"Could you have picked something stinkier to bring on a plane? [Andy laughs] My God, Oscar. Really? Do you have a bag of baby poop in there too, to share with everybody? No, I will be ordering my own food, thank you very much."

6664,What would you like to drink?,[walks into Kelly's cubicle and sets a box down on the desk] Just checking out where I'm going to be pretty soon.  When Pam gets back.  Gonna be close quarters.  Gonna be a lot of tension.
6665,Is that supposed to impress me? [Ryan starts trying to do one-armed pushups],"[talking head] No. Not going to happen.  He has hurt me too much and too often.  And I am in a healthy relationship so I'm not gonna flaunt it and I'm not gonna hurt him, but that door is closed."
6666,[making out with Ryan on her desk] What are we doing?  This is so wrong.,Yeah... Mmmmm...
6667,Where's the concierge?,Yes! Wallace said there would be one of those.
6668,[to concierge] What about a nice sushi place?  Maybe a place with a view?,"Tsk... Oh.  Matsuki.  That's a good one.  Uh, you may walk there if you wish or you man take the number seventeen bus until 9:00.  Other than that you can take the taxi and the number is right there."
6669,One final question. Where might you find yourself on a Winnipeg night like tonight?,"Oh, the Huntsman is good."
6670,[in office] Are you sure?,[over the phone] I just talked to my advisor. Failing.
6671,That means another twelve weeks.  [pause] Can you do this for another three months?,"It's not--- It's not about me.  I mean, this your dream."
6672,And you went to New York to do this.  So when you come back you come back the right way. Right?,[starting to cry] Right.

6728,"Why have I stayed at Dunder Mifflin for so long? Certainly not because of the paycheck.  'Cause I could be making more money as a doctor or a professional athlete.

[fist bumps Jim] Day one. Congrats."
6729,"I'm coming back the wrong way.  [smiles at Jim across the parking lot] It's not because of you.  I don't like graphic design. That's it. [laughs] Stop smiling. I really didn't like it.

6736,"Oh, can you imagine?",Oh no.
6737,I don't know.  What?,"You should probably just meander back there; take a look.  See if he's, see if he's back."
6738,"Hmmm, dare I? [laughs]  You know what? I'm going to, for old time's sake.  [walks to the annex, standing in Toby's cubicle] Great practical joke Jim, you got me to go to the annex. [turns around and sees Toby]","Hi, Micha-"
6739,"Michael, is everyone okay?","Uh, well I'm afraid not.  Toby Flenderson, of H.R., has made a sudden reappearance."
6740,"I don't understand, is anyone hurt?","Not on the surface, no, but I can tell people are disturbed, David."
6741,All in caps.  Do you know what 911 means?,"I learned a while back that if I don't text 911 people will not return my calls.   Um, but now people always return my calls because they think that something horrible has happened."
6742,Is there no way we can get rid of him?,"Not without cause, Michael."
6743,"[pours something from the fridge into a bowl and opens the microwave, it is covered in exploded food] Oh, come on! [to the documentary crew] Do you see this?  Disgusting.","So, Tunes, you still gonna buy your old man's place?"

6745,"Yeah, I am.  Wait, how do you know that?  I didn't tell you that.","Ehhh no, I was just walking by your desk.  I saw some email.  I got peepers of an eagle."
6746,"So Jim, you're gonna live in the same house that you used to pee the bed in?","Yeah, I guess technically Kev, you're right."
6747,"Today's a big day.  Today's the day that I show Pam the house that I bought for us. Without telling her. But it's my parent's house, the house I grew up in and yeah, I bought it kind of impulsively. I mean, the price was good and I was helping out my mom.  It's got shag carpets.  I mean you can't blame my parents it was the 70's.  And why would you want to buy ugly wood from trees when you can have paneling? And a painting of some creepy clowns that is apparently crucial to the structural integrity of the building. [tugs and pulls in vain at the clown painting]  She's gonna love it.  Right?",Could you guys all do me a favor and not talk about this until I tell Pam?
6748,Could you guys all do me a favor and not talk about this until I tell Pam?,"Whoa, you haven't told the misses about the castle?  You're in for a spanking my friend.  Myself and my lady? - no secrets."
6749,"Whoa, you haven't told the misses about the castle?  You're in for a spanking my friend.  Myself and my lady? - no secrets.","Jim, don't listen to Andy.  I think it's so romantic."
6750,Where's your place?,"Oh, it's on uh Linden Ave?  By the quarry?"
6751,"Oh, it's on uh Linden Ave?  By the quarry?",Ohhh...
6752,"Yeah.  Wait, what, the mess or the note?",The note.  So 'holier than thou'.
6753,Don't you think the person who left the mess is the obnoxious one?,"No, the note is way more obnoxious than the mess."
6754,"Sincerely, disappointed? Get off your high horse, Richie.","Just because someone likes things clean, doesn't mean they're rich."
6755,"You want to see some really high caliber acting?  Well, Mr. Kurt Russell, you are about to be served. [walks to the annex] Hey Toby, great to have you back, man.  Seriously, just a, just a real pleasure to see you again.",Well thanks Michael.
6756,So Costa Rica that was - did you have fun?  That must have been fun.,"Well, um, it was amazing.  It really was, thanks for asking.  Um the beaches were pristine..."
6757,"Nice beaches, pristine beaches?","...and, yeah, the whole thing was incredibly cathartic."
6758,Why'd you come back?  Why didn't you stay?,It was actually kind of hard to meet people I found.
6759,"Are you all right, Michael?","Yeah, I am.  I am."
6760,What are you doing?,[removes glasses] I am the bait.
6761,For what?,Men find me desirable.
6762,You're the bait for Toby?,Mmhmm.
6763,[looks up] Why aren't you as mad or interested in this as me?,"Oh totally.  Sorry, are we talking about the microwave still?"
6764,"Oh totally.  Sorry, are we talking about the microwave still?",Are you inching away from me?
6765,Are you inching away from me?,No.
6766,"What do you need, Michael?","Okay, what I would like you to do is take this folded note, and deliver it to Toby Flenderson?  I just want you to just react to whatever this note elicits.  Do not read it beforehand.  Can you do that for me?"
6767,"Okay, what I would like you to do is take this folded note, and deliver it to Toby Flenderson?  I just want you to just react to whatever this note elicits.  Do not read it beforehand.  Can you do that for me?","Good. [Pam stands up and starts reading note] N-no no no, don't."
6768,[kissing Kelly against her desk] You did that for me?,Mmhmm.
6769,Are you happy you did?,Hey guys that's really inappropriate.
6770,[kisses for a little longer]  What's up?,"Um, I got some photos from Costa Rica if you want to see them?"
6771,"Um, I got some photos from Costa Rica if you want to see them?","Yeah, yeah I'll see them."
6772,Toby can I see those? Ooh. [takes photos and throws them on the floor] What's the matter?  What's the matter? You scared?,Those are fighting words.
6773,You mad? You mad at me?,I hope he doesn't haul off and just hit you.
6774,"Do you want to do that?  You want to hit me, you want to punch me?",Hmmm?
6775,Hmmm?,Huh?  He might do it...
6776,Huh?  He might do it...,"Punch him, Toby!"
6777,"Hey hey! Come on, Ryan, who's side are you on?","Ryan.  Come on, man?"
6778,"Ryan.  Come on, man?","No do it, do it.  I dare you."
6779,Are you really not going to punch him?,"No, why would I punch you?"
6780,"No, why would I punch you?",Son of a bitch.
6781,What's that?,"[goes over and closes office door] Frame him, for using drugs."
6782,Frame him?,"Yeah, it's illegal, but... everything they do on The Shield is illegal."
6783,"I've never framed a man before, have you?",Oh I've framed animals before.  I framed a raccoon for opening a Christmas present.  And I framed a bear for eating out of the garbage.
6784,"Hello.  I've seen you guys around.  I'm Michael Scott, Dunder Mifflin.   How you doing?  [they stare at him] Uhghh, so I guess you know why I'm here?  I need to purchase something.",A fridge?
6785,A fridge?,"No. Uh, I wanted--- I wanted to buy some weed? Some..."
6786,"No. Uh, I wanted--- I wanted to buy some weed? Some...",What?
6787,What?,"Grass, weed?"
6788,"Grass, weed?",What makes you think we'd have weed?
6789,What makes you think we'd have weed?,I heard you drug---  I heard you dealt.
6790,Why would you even say that?,"[comes back up to Michael] Hey, that's gonna be 500 dollars."
6791,How much? How many pounds is it?,"It's- it's two pounds.  I'm losing money on this man just, give me the money.  Alright, walk away."
6792,"Hey, Pam?  I just wanted to let you know; I'm totally on your side with the whole microwave situation.",Thank you.
6793,"I know, can you believe it?","Yeah, it's crazy.  But, I guess the thing is at some point, notes or no notes, someone's gonna have to just get there and clean it up."
6794,"I guess that's why we have a temp, huh?","Ah ha ha, oh no, trust me.  I would just make it worse."
6795,How would wiping it with a paper towel make it worse?,I--- I would find a way.
6796,"You've seen things cleaned before though, right?","I--- Pam, I am hopeless at that stuff I... I, uh..."
6797,"Hi, we received a call?",I don't know anything about that.
6798,Here?,"Hey, Pam. Hey I got this, okay?  Hello, officers, Dwight Schrute, former volunteer Sheriff's Deputy.  Listen, I may have inside information that someone is hiding drugs in this very office.  [leads them back towards the annex as Creed stands up and starts to put him hands up and then relaxes them behind his ears]"
6799,"Hey, Pam. Hey I got this, okay?  Hello, officers, Dwight Schrute, former volunteer Sheriff's Deputy.  Listen, I may have inside information that someone is hiding drugs in this very office.  [leads them back towards the annex as Creed stands up and starts to put him hands up and then relaxes them behind his ears]",Just pretend like we're talking until the cops leave.
6800,"Hey, what is this?",Search his things.
6801,"Sir, can you step away from your desk please?",Why?
6802,Why?,"Sir, please step away from your desk."
6803,"Hey, what's going on?  You don't have my permission to do this.","They don't need your permission, Flenderson, they've got the company's permission."
6804,"Hey, hey what are- why are you doing this?","Uh, you know what?  I think that this... uh, this is probably a misunderstanding."
6805,"Uh, you know what?  I think that this... uh, this is probably a misunderstanding.",Don't search my stuff.
6806,Sir?,I have a reasonable right to privacy.
6807,"Yeah, let's just cancel this, okay?","Sir, did you recently return from a trip to Central America?"
6808,"Sir, did you recently return from a trip to Central America?",Oh my God!
6809,That was... I went to Costa Rica for a few months.  What is going on?,"No, that was... that was legitimate.  That was totally legitimate."
6810,Really?,Check this out.
6811,What is going on here?,"God! No, that's not... I don't know what that is.  And I... I bet he has nothing to do with that!"
6812,Do you have any weapons?,Of course not!
6813,Salad dressing?,"Yeah it's, uh, a caprese salad.  There's a little bit of, uh, mozerella right there."
6814,Are you kidding me?  That's my salad.,"So wait a minute, there's no drugs?"
6815,"So wait a minute, there's no drugs?",No.
6816,"Wait, officers, are you sure you don't want to interrogate him?",No.
6817,[following them out] You have laws that protect you in any kind of interrogation.  Why don't you use them?,You must feel pretty good about yourself right now.
6818,Did you?,Since when is it illegal to put caprese salad... anywhere.
6819,"Are you kidding me?  Are you kidding me, that's who you're worried about?  You're... you're worried about the cop's time?  You think I framed you, and you're worried about the taxpayer?  Dah, God! Welcome back, jerky jerk-face.",You said you were leaving and you made liars out of all of us.  So...
6820,Do you want to hear a lie?,What?
6821,What?,I think you're great.  You're my best friend.
6822,Can't do what?,It's not fair to you.  And it's really not fair to me.
6823,"Wait, what are you saying?  I broke up with Darryl so I could be with you.",That was your choice; don't put that on me.  I'm just going on a little trip.
6824,"Oh, can I come?","It's not that kind of trip.  I'm going to Thailand with some friends from high school, well, a high school.  And if I don't do it now I'll never get to go.  And I'll always resent you for it... you don't want me to resent you, do you?"
6825,"It's not that kind of trip.  I'm going to Thailand with some friends from high school, well, a high school.  And if I don't do it now I'll never get to go.  And I'll always resent you for it... you don't want me to resent you, do you?",So you're dumping me?
6826,So you're dumping me?,"Let's be adults about this.  Let's have sex one more time.  And if you have any extra cash, that would be amazing."
6827,Okay?,"[walking out of the building] Hey, do you mind if we make a stop on the way home?"
6828,"[walking out of the building] Hey, do you mind if we make a stop on the way home?",Sure.
6829,[getting out of the car] What are we doing at your parent's house?,"I have a surprise for you.  All right, ready?  Close your eyes and now [spins her around once] open your eyes.  Tadah!"
6830,"I have a surprise for you.  All right, ready?  Close your eyes and now [spins her around once] open your eyes.  Tadah!",I don't get it.
6831,You do?,"Yeah, I love it!"
6832,Really?,"I mean, you bought me a house!"
6833,"Um, do we have to sleep in your parent's bedroom?","No, No, we'll just board that up.  It'll be that weird spare room that people ask us about."
6834,And the clown?,"Yeah, I can't... really can't move him."
6835,"What is my perfect crime?  I break into Tiffany's at midnight.  Do I go for the vault? No, I go for the chandelier.  It's priceless.  As I'm taking it down, a woman catches me.  She tells me to stop.  It's her father's business.  She's Tiffany.  I say no.  We make love all night.  In the morning the cops come and I escape in one of their uniforms.  I tell her to meet me in Mexico but I go to Canada.  I don't trust her.  Besides, I like the cold.  Thirty years later, I get a postcard.  I have a son and he's the chief of police.  This is where the story gets interesting: I tell Tiffany to meet me in Paris, by the Trocadero.  She's been waiting for me all these years; she's never taken another lover.  I don't care, I don't show up. I go to Berlin.  That's where I stashed the chandelier.",Here are our final actual costs for this year.
6836,"So you can give that dollar back to mommy and daddy, but guess what? Next summer...",I'll be six.
6837,"Guess what, everybody? Christmas has come early this year. Oscar, very smartly, has discovered an extra $4300 in the budget. Thank you, Oscar. And I have decided with that money I am going to buy a new, drum roll please... [imitates drum roll] Can anybody guess?",New chairs?
6838,New chairs?,"No, a new copier! [only Oscar applauds] Unless everybody can agree on something better?"
6839,"No, a new copier! [only Oscar applauds] Unless everybody can agree on something better?","No, no, please. Please do not do this."
6840,So... we all agree to get new chairs then. Good?,"[over indistinct conversation] Good? Yeah, he said good, I'm good..."
6841,"[over indistinct conversation] Good? Yeah, he said good, I'm good...","Now listen, we are a paper company. How can we take pride in our jobs if we have to put our fine paper in this wretched machine?"
6842,"Now listen, we are a paper company. How can we take pride in our jobs if we have to put our fine paper in this wretched machine?","Oscar, no. This is not the time for one of your principled stands."
6843,Michael?,Yes.
6844,What? Jim.,"Ever since Pam and I started dating, I just feel weird asking her to make copies for me. So, I make my own copies. And that copier sucks. Let me tell you, I-But you know what? Pam and I don't have to agree on everything."
6845,"Ever since Pam and I started dating, I just feel weird asking her to make copies for me. So, I make my own copies. And that copier sucks. Let me tell you, I-But you know what? Pam and I don't have to agree on everything.","Jim, good for you, standing up to Pam like that."
6846,"So Michael, what do you think?",Why me?
6847,Why me?,You have to make the decision.
6848,How could it be more clear?,I think Andy makes an excellent point.
6849,"Let's three-way this little issue, and come to a solution by the time we get to Schrute Farms, how's that for a plan?","We're getting married at Schrute Farms, no matter what. I have looked at twelve venues, I have lost eight deposits, and I have seen Angela naked zero times. I am not losing another deposit."
6850,"Beesly, are you threatening me?","Jim. Jim, Jim, Jim. I'm not threatening you. I love you. [whispers] But you should know, you're on very dangerous ground [kisses Jim]. [at normal volume] All right."
6851,"Hmm... mm, what's that smell?",You're gonna need to be more specific.
6852,Do you have to slaughter on our wedding day?,"You wanna eat, don't you?"
6853,"You wanna eat, don't you?","Honey, say something!"
6854,"Uh, Dwight, if we pay extra, could you slaughter the entrees the day before?",...I'll consider it.
6855,"See? That's how you do it! Makin' progress here. [steps in manure, trying to laugh it off] ...Darn! Heh.",There's a hose out back.
6856,"Remember, you were gonna get a new chair, and you were gonna give your old chair to me. Remember that?",Yes.
6857,Michael?,I don't know. I haven't decided yet.
6858,I'm just gonna grab some lunch. You wanna come with?,"Really? Absolutely! Yeah, that would be amazing."
6859,"Really? Absolutely! Yeah, that would be amazing.","Woah, you guys going to lunch?"
6860,"Woah, you guys going to lunch?",Yes.
6861,Mind if I join?,"Ohh, God!"
6862,Where we going?,I have no idea.
6863,"Look, I really need this new chair. I mean, seriously, how is it possible that in five years I've had two engagement rings, and only one chair?",[laughing uproariously with Michael and Jim] Stop it! Michael.
6864,"[through the laughter] Oh, is somebody making fun of me?","The best. Great friends. Thank you, Michael. [all three are still laughing]"
6865,Michael?,Yeah?
6866,Yeah?,Hey!
6867,You got a second?,I do.
6868,"Hey, have I told you you look really nice today?","Oh, thank you."
6869,"Yeah, is that a new tie?","Um, no, not... no. No, I got it at TJ Maxx, four dollars."
6870,You think that's good? Check out these pants. Nine dollars.,What?
6871,What?,Nine dollars. The boys' department.
6872,"Yeah, right?",Very valid.
6873,Have you made a decision on the butter sculpture?,No. I haven't thought of it.
6874,"What is this? All right, we're all on the same team. Is it- [steps in manure] Damn! Why is that in the kitchen?!","[Pam is making copies and is struggling with the machine] You might want to consider changing teams, because we would-we would love to have you."
6875,Yeah?,Yeah. I have my copies. [holds up messed up copies]
6876,"So... why don't we try this out, we'll see what would happen. Give it a little test drive, what do you say? You pretend to be Angela's father, you will play Angela, and uh, I will pretend to be you. That way you can see what it looks like when you're up here.",[whistling Pachelbel's 'Canon in D;' switches to singing then back to whistling]
6877,What?,"Although born just minutes from here, he speaks only German. Closed society. So, now, after the readings by all of your sisters, we will arrive at the vows. So, Konrad... [speaks German to minister; minister begins speaking in German] And away we go. This is a little taste of the ceremony, if you will. He's explaining why we're here, what we're doing here, making introductions, blah blah blah... Then he's gonna have Andy repeat a bunch of stuff. He's gonna ask Andy to produce a ring. I have uh, now just uh... just some twine for our purposes, and you will put the ring on her finger. Yadda yadda, then he's going to ask Andy, uh, if he would like to marry Angela. And you will reply, 'I do.' [Andy mouths, 'I do' silently] And then he's going to ask Angela if she would like to marry Andy, to which you will reply..."
6878,Did somebody call Hank?,"Hank, thank God you're here. The office is at a crossroads."
6879,"So, there's no security problem? You know, I hustled up the stairs.","Yes. I need your sage advice. And everyone, whatever Hank decides, that is the decision. That will resolve this issue. [Hank takes some jellybeans from Pam's jar] Yeah, take as many as you want."
6880,So what are we talking about?,"Okay. Well, we have a surplus. Imagine that your parents give you money for a lemonade stand-"
6881,Is that the copier?,"It is, yes."
6882,What?,I was just thinking. Let me see a chair.
6883,"Well, what should I do?",...Let me see the copier again.
6884,What do you mean?,"Well Monkey, he's a real minister. And you said, 'I do.' And I said, 'I do.' And Andy wasn't signing a receipt; he was signing our marriage certificate as a witness."
6885,"Are we, uh... are we leaving or what? [Mose hits Andy in the head with a deflated ball] Ow!",[on speakerphone] Michael.
6886,Is this why you're calling me?,"No, no, no, no, no. No. I'm calling- [coughs again] I'm sorry."
6887,You want me to weigh in on a minor budget issue?,"No, no, no. I want you to make the decision so I'm not the bad guy."
6888,The what now?,Branch managers who come in under budget get 15% of the savings.
6889,...Like a tip? [calculates amount] $645?!,"I hate disappointing just one person. And I really hate disappointing everyone. But I love Burlington Coat Factory. You go in there with $645, you are literally a king."
6890,"[on the phone] We have that going out Tuesday... Okay? Sure, no, I can... I'll double-check that for you.","All right, attention everyone."
6891,"Pam, would you stand up for a sec? [sits in Pam's chair] Hmm. See how relaxed I am? I like this chair. [slowly sinking into the chair] Offers good support, it is urkelnomically correct... it's a good chair. I think we're spoiled because we don't appreciate the things that we have. You think kids in Africa have chairs? No. They sit in big piles of garbage. You think they have copiers?  [the chair has slowly lowered itself almost to where Michael is not visible over the desk] They don't have copiers. They don't even- [struggles to get up from Pam's chair] Gah! They don't even have paper. And we are spoiled because we throw out perfectly good tiramisu because it has a little tiny hair on it. My point I this: I have seen the light in terms of what we need, and it is nothing.",Do you know?
6892,Do you know?,Do I know what?
6893,Do I know what?,I think you know.
6894,Know what?,"Yeah, know what?"
6895,"Yeah, know what?",Does anyone happen to know what 15% of 4300 is?
6896,Does anyone happen to know what 15% of 4300 is?,$645.00
6897,Why'd you say dollars?,Because that is how my mind works.
6898,"What's 15% of 200? [Michael doesn't answer] Thank you. Everyone, Michael is returning the surplus so he can keep 15% as a bonus.","Wait, what?"
6899,"Wait, what?",You can do that?
6900,You can do that?,"Hey Michael, what's 394 times 5,912?"
6901,"Hey Michael, what's 394 times 5,912?",Let's see...
6902,You're gonna give yourself a bonus of $645 instead of getting the entire office something it really needs?,"I don't need $645; I already have $645, more or less."
6903,You're gonna get us a copier then?,This is so stupid.
6904,Or chairs?,"This is so, so stupid. And, God... [looks at his watch] that's my phone."
6905,Was that hot or what?,So what's it gonna be?
6906,So what's it gonna be?,"Michael, you have to make a decision. The day is almost done."
6907,[groans in frustration] You think it's easy?,It's your job.
6908,"Okay, you know what? Why don't you guys deal with it? I am going to get up, and I am going to be out in the common area. But you need to decide; otherwise I'm taking the bonus. All right?","It is a classic management tactic. You have two sides, a deadline, you know that neither of them are gonna concede. What you do is you put 'em in a room, and you just- [Pam and Oscar come to the door of kitchen] Hey."
6909,What?,I just figured I'd rather have new chairs than nothing at all.
6910,"[wearing a fur coat] What did we learn this week? Well, one, thanks to me, my team is much, much faster at coming to decisions than I thought they would be. Number two, never buy a fur coat with a credit card until you absolutely have the money to pay for it. And three, [camera zooms out to see fake blood is splattered on the fur coat] you should know that some people think it's cool to throw buckets of fake blood on you as you are walking out of Burlington Coat Factory.",Truce?
6911,Truce?,"Yeah, I guess, since I won."
6912,What is this?,"Happy Holidays, Dwight. But do not open it till Christmas."
6913,You're so pathetic.  How long did this take you? Three hours?,Five minutes actually.  I am a black belt in gift wrapping.
6914,"Really? If I can skin a mule deer in less than ten minutes, I ought to be able to cut my -- [sets briefcase on desk and sits in chair, desk and chair are made of paper, Dwight crashes to the floor]",Eh...
6915,"Hey, Phyllis, do I need this invite to get in to the party?",Yes.
6916,Angela. You're going to move this for the party right? It's not on theme.,It's the nativity scene.
6917,"Every year I do research to determine which toy will be the most popular of the Christmas season.  This year it's a doll. Half girl, half unicorn.  Catchphrase: 'My horn can pierce the sky'.  Pathetic. I bought out every store in the area over the last couple of weeks.  And as lazy parents become desperate I will sell them for an enormous profit.  Isn't that right princess? [makes doll nod]",That's the Christmas spirit.
6918,I am simply punishing those parents that would wait till the last minute to get their child a gift.  And such a genetically improbable one.  Look at that.  How does that happen?  King has sex with a unicorn?  Man with a horn has sex with a royal horse?,Yes.
6919,"Oh, hey, is that Princess Unicorn?  I thought they were all sold out.",They are now.
6920,Really Andy? It's Christmas and your singing about nudity and France.,[sings] There's a hole in the wall where the men can see it all.
6921,What is it?,That is vodka and I mixed it with orange juice.  I call it an orange-vod-juice...ka.
6922,"We're back on the 5th, should we just do it then?","Can not do it then. Monthly dental appointment, soft teeth"
6923,What about February 2nd?,Ah... would you want to do it on Groundhogs day?
6924,Ah... would you want to do it on Groundhogs day?,"No, no. I celebrate privately."
6925,Why don't we just do it now? We'll do it quickly.,Now? It's our Christmas party.
6926,Now? It's our Christmas party.,We'll do it quickly.
6927,[mimicking] What if we can't do it quickly? What if we cant do it--,Do you know how to do an intervention?
6928,Do you know how to do an intervention?,"Hey, shut up. Here we go. Everybody gather up."
6929,"Okay, how do you feel?",A little better. I threw up.
6930,Fire girl. [looks around] Too soon?,Yeah.
6931,"Alright, well, let's look at this a little bit closer then shall we? [pulls a piece of paper out of his pocket]","When I was in college I used to get wicked hammered. My nickname was puke.  I would chug a fifth of socos, sneak into a frat party, polish off a few people's empties, some brewskies, some Jell-O shots, do some body shots off myself, pass out, wake up the next morning, puke, rally, more soco, head to class.  Probably would have gotten expelled if I had let it affect my grades, but I aced all my courses.  They called me Ace.  It was totally awesome.  Got straight B's.  They called me Buzz."
6932,"Meredith, have you ever used alcohol to alter your mood or deliberately change your state of mind?",Sure.
6933,Do you sometimes have a drink to celebrate a special occasion or mark a holiday?,Obviously.
6934,Have you ever under the influence of alcohol questioned the teachings of the Mormon church?,Where did you get this?
6935,Where did you get this?,"I got it on a website, that's not important."
6936,"Okay, you know what Toby?  One of my employees is undergoing a crisis and I wish for just once you would take my side on this.  I'm doing your job man.  Hey, are you texting?","Yeah, 'cause this is kind of a drag."
6937,"Alcohol is a drag. Yes.  Here's what I'd like to do.  I'd like to go around the room and have us each express to Meredith how her alcoholism has affected us.  I'll begin.  This Christmas party is perhaps the best Christmas party I have ever been to, but then you got so drunk that we had to stop and do this.  That's how your drinking affected me.  Anybody else?  Another time when Meredith's drinking affected you?   Come on people.  If we don't say anything she's not going to get any better.  [Kevin raises his hand] Yes, Kevin.","Well, Meredith, there was that one time you bought movie tickets and then you got too drunk to go, so you gave them to me.  And that was really cool."
6938,"Okay, no, that's not what we're going for.  Who has a problem with Meredith's drinking?  It has to bother you.  It bothers me. Right? How does it bother you?  Dwight, don't you have anything?","No, I like Meredith."
6939,Who is going to tell us the latest dirty joke?  Who is going to tell us what you watched on television last night?,I am fine.
6940,"Was John Belushi fine?  Was Bob Hope fine?  Hey-- come here.  If anything ever happened to you, I would be very angry at myself for not doing all that I could do.",I know I drink. I like to party
6941,You never showed me mercy when you were in charge.  Why aren't you wearing the hairnet?,I lost it. [Phyllis glares at her until Angela pulls out the hairnet and puts it on]
6942,"[amid groans from the rest of the office] Alright, no, no, no.  No. That is the image, I think we can all agree is very disgusting.  But you know what, Meredith, you lit your hair on fire today.  What about tomorrow.?  What is going to happen when you come into work and you're dead?",I stab her in the brain with a wooden stick.
6943,Really?,"Okay you know, this-- this is over."
6944,"You know what the only thing I want for Christmas? I want Meredith to get better.  That's my only wish.  But you know what?  My wishes never come true, so I'm not going to wish that on her. I-- a watch would be nice.",[watching Meredith and Michael talk in his office] They've been in there for 45 minutes.
6945,What's up?,Do you take requests?
6946,Do you take requests?,Sure.
6947,[whispers to Meredith] I'll be down in a minute. [walks over to Toby] Could you write down the number of that rehabilitation center that you mentioned?,Sure. Wow. [Michael throws a pen at his head] Ow...
6948,We did?,"Yeah, I thought we were going out for a drink?"
6949,"Yeah, I thought we were going out for a drink?","Oh, shoot.  Oh well, we'll have to go someplace else then I guess."
6950,"The Bog? Cooper's, Kelly's...","We could go there, sure."
6951,"[on phone] Hey Sasha, it's daddy.  Have you ever heard of this doll , Princess Unicorn?","[shouting excitedly over the phone] Daddy, daddy, daddy!!"
6952,Something wrong with the doll?,No.  It's even-- it's even better than the one I wanted.
6953,Sunrise Rehab?  No! No! No!  I told you no! There is no way!,It's okay. It's all right.
6954,[dragging Meredith on the floor into the rehab center] Let's start meeting-- Hello. How are you?,This man is crazy! This man is crazy!
6955,Can I help you?,I have a deposit.  Alcoholic.
6956,So do I sign?,NO!!!
6957,Excuse me?,"I'm not moving the tree.  Face it. The only power you have over me is this big secret that I know you're not going to tell.  And you want to know how I know that? Because then you won't be able to plan your stupid, tacky parties anymore. So you move the tree."
6958,"I'm not moving the tree.  Face it. The only power you have over me is this big secret that I know you're not going to tell.  And you want to know how I know that? Because then you won't be able to plan your stupid, tacky parties anymore. So you move the tree.","Okay. [starts to walk away, then turns around] Angela's having sex with Dwight.  I caught them doing it after Toby's going away party."
6959,"[answering the phone] Dunder Mifflin, this is Pam. I'm sorry, he's not in yet. Would you like his voicemail?","[heard yelling from the street] Yeah! Yeah! Yeah, okay! Twelve miles an hour. Eat that, Carl Lewis!"
6960,"[entering the office] Excuse me, everyone, can I have the floor please? Um, this is insanely awkward. It's kind of the elephant in the room, so I'll just... [sighs] No one has RSVP'ed to our wedding yet, and the deadline was yesterday.","Wait, you still don't know..."
6961,Hmm?,Nothing.
6962,[to Jim] What are you doing?,How about we just... Just have to talk to you for a second...
6963,[sighs] How can he still not know?,We can't figure that out.
6964,"Wait, what?  You can't take what?",I am telling Andy.
6965,"Who should it come from, then?",[simultaneously] Angela.
6966,[to Dwight] Are you still having intercourse with her? [Dwight's expression implies 'yes'],What is wrong with you? She is engaged.
6967,What is wrong with you? She is engaged.,Did you ever have intercourse in this office? [Dwight's expression implies 'yes']
6968,Did you ever have intercourse in this office? [Dwight's expression implies 'yes'],"Are you serious? Ugh. Where? [Dwight stares at Oscar; more forcefully] Where? [Dwight's expression implies 'at your desk'; Oscar's voice breaks] Where, Dwight?"
6969,"Are you serious? Ugh. Where? [Dwight stares at Oscar; more forcefully] Where? [Dwight's expression implies 'at your desk'; Oscar's voice breaks] Where, Dwight?",[coolly] Seems like you already know where.
6970,"Because I wouldn't want an innocent person, who doesn't know anything about the form... [Angela puts headphones on; Kevin looks at Oscar] What?","That was good... It's just, at the end you weren't saying something that could also apply to the form."
6971,"How about, 'I'm sorry I did such a whorish job filling out this form?'",There you go.
6972,"[on the phone] That cannot be true! [Dwight jumps] You're going to charge me a fee to cut my own cake? Uh, no. No, no, no. What I'm saying is, I want to cut it myself...",[whispering to Jim] Trade seats with me.
6973,What is it?,You've got to tell Andy about us.
6974,Do you love me or not?,I've already admitted that I do. Why do you keep making me repeat it?
6975,I've already admitted that I do. Why do you keep making me repeat it?,Because you're engaged to Andy.
6976,Well?,Not yet.
6977,When?,When what? [clears throat] When what?
6978,When what? [clears throat] When what?,You know this can't go on.
6979,What can't go on?,We have to put an end to this.
6980,When will she be ready?,I don't know.
6981,Is she crazy in bed?,[boastfully] Yes.
6982,Stop. What?,"How so, specifically?"
6983,"How so, specifically?","Okay, listen."
6984,Really?,This shouldn't be coming from his boss. And we should also consider the fact that that man has an anger issue.
6985,"Okay, what does that mean?",Might get ugly.
6986,Thanks. [to Andy] Andy?,Yeah.
6987,What?,All right. See you later. [backs out of the parking space] Ahh.
6988,Are you serious?,Yep. [drives off]
6989,[to Dwight] What are you standing for?,"If I'm sitting, I can't disable his neck or his groin."
6990,Is it true?,What have you heard?
6991,What have you heard?,That you're sleeping with Dwight.
6992,Is it true?,"Andy, I'm engaged to you. I mean, we just signed off on our wedding flowers. Would I have said yes to formal chrysanthemums if I didn't want to get married? And, we went through all that stuff with our wedding cake..."
6993,"Andy, I'm engaged to you. I mean, we just signed off on our wedding flowers. Would I have said yes to formal chrysanthemums if I didn't want to get married? And, we went through all that stuff with our wedding cake...",Just answer the question. Are you sleeping with Dwight?
6994,Just answer the question. Are you sleeping with Dwight?,A little bit.
6995,How long has it been going on?,"I don't know. I mean, we were together, and then he killed sprinkles, and then we stopped, and... I don't know exactly when we started up again."
6996,Who else knows about it?,Michael.
6997,Who else?,"[quietly] Let me think about it... I, um... there... [Andy looks over to see everyone watching them]"
6998,"So listen, Michael, your branch has been doing great lately, and your sales staff is reporting very strong numbers. Out-performing last year, in fact. Um, and I don't know exactly how to put this, but... what are you doing right?",Right what?
6999,Right what?,"Utica, Albany, all the other branches are struggling, but your branch is reporting strong numbers. [Michael smiles] Look, you're not our most traditional guy, but clearly, something you are doing... is right. And I just, I need to get a sense of what that is."
7000,"This is going to sound sort of high-maintenance, but could we have it, like, three degrees cooler in here? I always think better when it's cooler.","Here's the thing. Michael is doing something right. And in this economic climate, no method of success can be ignored. It's not really time for executives to start getting judgmental now. It's Hail Mary time."
7001,"[pokes his head in] Hey, what say we order up some pasta?",What say we do.
7002,"Standard, you know? Nothing fancy.","So like, missionary..."
7003,Do you love him?,I love you.
7004,Why should I believe that?,"Andy, we are at a crossroads here. And we can either give in to what people are saying that we're not good together."
7005,Who says that?,"Or, we can prove them wrong. Let's prove them wrong."
7006,Where's Dwight?,"You okay, man?"
7007,"You okay, man?","No. Not at all, actually. But thanks for asking. Appreciate it. You know what? I'd also like to take this opportunity to thank all of you for lying. To my face. And not telling me what's been going on this entire time."
7008,"No. Not at all, actually. But thanks for asking. Appreciate it. You know what? I'd also like to take this opportunity to thank all of you for lying. To my face. And not telling me what's been going on this entire time.",You are welcome.
7009,"Hey guys, why don't we, uh, just cool off a bit?",I'm telling you to back down.
7010,Oh really? How are you gonna do that?,Through the use of force.
7011,What is your weapon?,"Okay, you know what? That's enough. Because..."
7012,"Okay, you know what? That's enough. Because...","Hey, this is none of your business."
7013,Guess what? Not happening at work.,Yes!
7014,None of your business then. [Dwight and Andy high five] Good. So what weapon?,My bare hands.
7015,[innocently] How'd that get there?,There's a star-shaped thing taped under the kitchen table.
7016,"So I was in the office, and I look over to our Accounting division, and there is Kevin Malone. Kevin is wearing a jacket that I've never seen before. And I call over to Kevin, 'Kevin, is that a tweed jacket?' And he looks at me and he says, 'Michael, yes it is a tweed jacket.' And I look back at him and I say, 'I feel the need!... The need for tweed.'","It's hard to try and evaluate yourself, Michael, but I appreciate you trying. [gets up] And thanks for coming in."
7017,[shouting] Come on! Where are you? Let's do this thing! Come on! Come on out!,[watching from the conference room] I can't believe they're gonna fight over me.
7018,"Hey, has anything happened yet?",Where are you?
7019,Where are you?,"Mm-mm. It's 4:10, I don't think he's gonna show."
7020,"Come on, coward! Where are you? Where... [spots a note attached to the bushes; goes to read it] 'From the desk of Andrew Bernard.' [scoffs] A note. Pathetic. 'Dear Dwight, by now you have received my note. How are you? I am well. You are no doubt wondering why I have left this note. It has come to my attention that in any physical match with you, I would surely be bested.' True. 'The soft underbelly of my refined upbringing is my soft underbelly...' [as Dwight continues to read, Andy drives around the corner very slowly]","There's Andy, he's in his car. You guys, what is he doing?"
7021,"There's Andy, he's in his car. You guys, what is he doing?",Why isn't Dwight turning around?
7022,Why isn't Dwight turning around?,The Prius is silent if he keeps it under five miles per hour. He deserves the win.
7023,What's happening?,Andy's running over Dwight with his car.
7024,You give up?,Never! [hits Andy's car with his bike chain] Get out and face me like a man!
7025,You're not a man! You don't know how to take care of her! [hits his car with the bike chain] All you do is dress fancy and sing. [imitating Andy] 'La la la la la la la la la la!' What does that mean? You can't even protect her!,"Protect her from what? Bears, you idiot? When's the last time you saw a damn bear in Scranton?"
7026,"Protect her from what? Bears, you idiot? When's the last time you saw a damn bear in Scranton?","Last year, idiot! [hits his car with the bike chain]"
7027,Dwight! Are your legs broken?,No. My right one's falling asleep a little bit.
7028,"Andy, are you all right?","Go away, Tuna! I'm winning this!"
7029,"Yeah, back off. This isn't your fight. Oh, how much is this gonna cost? [hits his car with the bike chain] Oh! What? Trust fund will take care of that! [hits his car with the bike chain]","What did you say? I'm sorry, I couldn't hear you."
7030,"What did you say? I'm sorry, I couldn't hear you.",I sa- [Andy honks his horn]
7031,"What? You stupid idiot! [Andy honks his horn] You're like, you're like a Sasquatch! You live in the woods...","Sasquatches are the strongest animal on the planet! So fine, call me a Sasquatch!"
7032,I don't get it! How can she be sleeping with you this whole time and only sleep with me twice?,What?
7033,What?,What!
7034,She's sleeping with you?,I'm her fiance.
7035,"Wow, what a day! Haha! I thought I was gong to get chewed out, but, hold on! Here's an attaboy for ya! What? Rollercoaster ride! Rollercoaster! It just goes to show, you leave Scranton, exciting things can happen. [sighs] Ahh!","[as Jim is collecting weapons, runs to the couch near reception and pulls out a crossbow; Jim catches him and he hands it over]"
7036,What's this?,Looks like a red wire.
7037,Doesn't it?,"No, it's going in a different direction then the other wires."
7038,What are you doing?,"I got 500 feet of red wire at a flea market up by Dunmore High School. 20 bucks for the whole spool. Crazy, what a deal. [behind Jim, Dwight climbs telephone pole] Oh he'll be fine. I made it up there."
7039,"What you talking bout, Wallace? [imitating What you talking bout Willis]",Hi Michael how are you?
7040,Hi Michael how are you?,"Hi, I am well, how are you?"
7041,"Hi, I am well, how are you?","So listen, as you know, we haven't yet filled the regional supervisor job."
7042,"Oh, have you not?","Correct. And I was wondering if I could get you to do some of the field work that would normally go to the supervisor [Michael makes exaggerated oh-my-gosh face at camera]. There is an area from Carbondale to Marshbrook, where we have never done any business."
7043,"Fax, why don't you just send it over on a dinosaur?","Look, this is important, Michael."
7044,What are you guys talking about?,"Some actress, whether shes hot."
7045,Who is the gal in question?,Hillary Swank.
7046,Have you seen her with her bangs?,She looks like a monster.
7047,So what do we do now?,[riding in car with Michael] What if the owner of Prince Family Paper has a beautiful daughter and we have to seduce her in order to get their secrets?
7048,[riding in car with Michael] What if the owner of Prince Family Paper has a beautiful daughter and we have to seduce her in order to get their secrets?,I will seduce her.
7049,"Yeah, so what if I did? That would take precedence and I would expect your support.","Okay, let's go over the plan again."
7050,Your fictitious name?,Michael Scarn.
7051,Are you socialist?,You know what? I don't want to get into this debate again. I enjoy IHOP.
7052,You know what? I don't want to get into this debate again. I enjoy IHOP.,I'll have a cup of a coffee.
7053,So what?,It means they are not expanding.
7054,Ready to do this?,Yeah.
7055,"You know, I will be honest with you... about something. Where we used to live, our paper supplier had a lot of big clients and I just didn't feel like a priority. So I guess my question [reaches for paper in his pocket with questions on it] for you would be [reading off sheet] how many clients do you have?",About 80.
7056,Really? That many? This doesn't seem like a very big operation.,"It's just me, my wife and my son."
7057,"Ah, so when did you set up shop?",I opened this place after I came back from Vietnam.
7058,"What difference does it make? Attractive, beautiful, hot, we're talking about the same thing here.","Huge difference. A painting can be beautiful, but I don't want to bang a painting."
7059,"So, even specialty paper, say 94 brightness double-bonded, you would put that on the same truck as your conventional stock?",You sure know a lot about paper for a lawyer.
7060,Oh really?,"Yes, well about some things, and other things I am very stupid. Like, watch this. Is this the cup? [picks up tape dispenser and makes drinking motion] Is this the cup? [picks up a stapler and makes drinking motion] Is this what I drink out of? [glug noise, both laugh] Laughter is my job, tears are my game, law is my profession."
7061,"Yes, well about some things, and other things I am very stupid. Like, watch this. Is this the cup? [picks up tape dispenser and makes drinking motion] Is this the cup? [picks up a stapler and makes drinking motion] Is this what I drink out of? [glug noise, both laugh] Laughter is my job, tears are my game, law is my profession.","Hello, I would like to apply for a job."
7062,Why don't you just get rid of this guy? [points to Prince Son],That's my son.
7063,"I'm your son now; you can visit him on holidays. Dwight Schrute, I'm a paper salesman at a second tier paper company called Dunder Mifflin.  I'm the top salesman there and I'm looking for a new challenge. I would say you guys have what, 40 high full volume clients?",Try 80.
7064,"I think all of us have a tendency to view celebrities as sort of mythical figures, you know? We don't really see them as real so therefore we don't judge them as real people.","Are you serious? Jim, just show us a picture."
7065,"Are you serious? Jim, just show us a picture.","Kevin, c'mon."
7066,"Kevin, you know what, why don't you close your eyes? Imagine that Hilary Swank comes into this office for real and she walks over to you [in a more and more seductive voice] and says Kevin Malone, I just read your online profile and there is nothing I would rather do then make out with you right now. And now you tell me something, is she hot? [Kevin gets up to join the 'hot' team to their great joy] Does that end the debate?","[Kevin sits down, gets right back up and heads back to 'not hot' team] No, it's is she hot, not would you do her. Respect the game."
7067,Grandfather: So why are you considering leaving Dunder Mifflin?,"My boss, his insensitivity might border on cruel. This is a man who does not listen to the needs his underlings. [Michael takes offense and charges over]"
7068,"Hey, hey, how is your interview going?",It's going very well.
7069,"Don't blow it. Hey Linda, can I get a picture of you?",You want a picture of me?
7070,You want a picture of me?,"I would, could you just stand over here? That would be great [positioning her towards sign of Prince Family Paper customers] Just a little something to remember the trip by. A little to your left [positions Linda to get better picture]"
7071,"I would, could you just stand over here? That would be great [positioning her towards sign of Prince Family Paper customers] Just a little something to remember the trip by. A little to your left [positions Linda to get better picture]",Can I get a copy of that?
7072,Can I get a copy of that?,"Grandma, I can't do this."
7073,"What's going on?  Little homework over here? Lets see if I can help. Huh, math, that's not so hard. Ok. There are 4 of these, ignore the parenthesis, right?",Right.
7074,"Why is this little 2 so small? It's, it's weird, you don't, you just go by the x. The x means times. 4 times x 2. What is double 4?",8
7075,"Oh God, what was that?",That's not good.
7076,"No, no, no no. Shes hot, okay? Because if you are saying Hillary Swank isn't hot, then you are saying that I am not hot. Because obviously I am not as hot as Hillary Swank! [Kelly runs away in tears]",Oh my God.
7077,Is everyone okay?,It sounded bad.
7078,"Ladies, are we prepared to let the Kevins of the world decide anything for us? Anything at all? We don't even give him full internet access.","[surprised] Wait, what?"
7079,"[surprised] Wait, what?","See that, the obvious symmetry of the face? That's a natural appeal of the scientific standard of coin aphelia, features that are a composite average of many features. Yes, she is attractive, but is not hot."
7080,"See that, the obvious symmetry of the face? That's a natural appeal of the scientific standard of coin aphelia, features that are a composite average of many features. Yes, she is attractive, but is not hot.",How much longer is this going to take?
7081,How much longer is this going to take?,You know let me give you some money for this.
7082,"This is disgusting, what is it this, instant?",Well that outta do it. [bumper is heavily duct taped to the car]
7083,"Dwight, what will happen to that family if I call David and give him this information?","Its simple, David would use that information to destroy them."
7084,"Why don't we just, live and let live?",What?
7085,What?,Live and let live.
7086,"Michael, you have to. Have you ever seen a lioness devour its cub? Have you ever seen a baboon devour its mate?  Have you ever seen a raccoon devour a squirrel?",My heart says...
7087,"Yeah, save your heart for love, and use your brain for business, right? If we don't do this to prince paper, someone else will. Worse yet, someone else will do it to us.","I am trying to be more optimistic in life. I've got what, 20 or 30 years left. And my family history says I have less. Now, the old Stanley Hudson would have found something wrong this actress. But that is no way to live life. Look at this healthy sexy pretty strong young woman. C'mon people! She is hot."
7088,"Good, so, [Michael takes client list and heads out of office] where are you going?",Just something I have to do first.
7089,Where are you taking the client list?,"Somewhere safe, where it can't hurt anyone [starts running, Dwight follows]"
7090,"Okay, it is time for the final votes. All of those in favor of resolution Hillary Swank is hot? [half of office raises hand] Okay. And all those opposed? [he skips back and joins other half of office in raising hand]",This is ridiculous.
7091,"Guess whose stock just went up, golden boy?",I guess this is what they call a bittersweet moment. It is bitter because I slightly destroyed a wonderful little family. But sweet because David Wallace thought I did a good job. That's what I hate bittersweet chocolate. I don't even... what's the point of that? Why not just sweet? Who are you helping?
7092,I guess this is what they call a bittersweet moment. It is bitter because I slightly destroyed a wonderful little family. But sweet because David Wallace thought I did a good job.

7093,"Oh, hey what is this?",Hillary swank.
7094,[looking around office to see if anyone notices the smoke]  Does anyone smell anything smoky?,Did you bring your jerky in again?
7095,Did you bring your jerky in again?,[clears throat]
7096,"Oh, fire!  Oh my goodness!  What's the procedure?  What do we do, people?",The phones are dead.
7097,"Oh, how did that happen?",It's out in the hall.
7098,"What's the procedure, everyone? What's the procedure?",Stay [bleep] calm!
7099,What does warm mean?,[groaning] Oh my God.
7100,"Okay, what's next?",Don't run.
7101,Oh! Here's a door.  Check that one out. How's the handle?,It-- it's warm.

7105,What's next?,Oscar!
7106,"How about 911?  Anyone? 911. [Michael throws a chair at the window, Kevin smashes a chair through the vending machine and begins to grab snacks, everyone is shouting.]",What do we do?
7107,What do we do?,Use the surge of fear and adrenaline to sharpen your decision-making.
7108,What is that?  What is that?,The fire's shooting at us!
7109,What in the name of God is going on?!,"Yes! [Dwight pulls fire alarm] Yes, ba-- Yes, battering ram! Battering ram!"
7110,What?!,"Fire not real.  This was merely a training exercise. [Oscar drops down from the ceiling] So, what have we learned? [Stanley falls to the floor]  Oh come on.  It's not real Stanley. Don't have a heart attack."
7111,"Fire not real.  This was merely a training exercise. [Oscar drops down from the ceiling] So, what have we learned? [Stanley falls to the floor]  Oh come on.  It's not real Stanley. Don't have a heart attack.","No, no, no! You will not die! Stanley! Stanley! You will not die!  Stanley! Stanley! Barack is president!  You are black, Stanley! I'm gonna give him mouth to mouth."
7112,How could you possibly think this is a good idea?,A lot of ideas were not appreciated in their time.
7113,"Did you shout, 'Fire!', causing a panic?","Yes I shouted 'fire!'.  I shouted many things! I also shouted instructions on how to get out of the building, so you can imagine my frustration as safety officer when nobody would heed of what-- heeded--"
7114,Wh--what?,"Okay. [walks to the window, sighs] This city.  Dwight. We are not mad, we are just disappointed."
7115,"Can you shove down?  Instead... shove down, please.  Instead, what I think we should do is strip of your title as safety officer.",No.
7116,"Michael, you have to take responsibility here. One of your employees had a heart attack.  He could have died, because of the way that you are allowing your office to run.  Do you want that on your conscious?",Do you?
7117,Do you?,Michael?
7118,Michael?,You talking to me?
7119,You talking to me?,Yeah.
7120,What?,Well... I guess we papered over that pretty nicely. [chuckles] It always amuses me when corporate thinks they can make some big change with a twenty minute meeting in some fancy high-rise. What's the matter? You hungry?
7121,Well... I guess we papered over that pretty nicely. [chuckles] It always amuses me when corporate thinks they can make some big change with a twenty minute meeting in some fancy high-rise. What's the matter? You hungry?,"[sighs] No, Dwight.  I am worried.  A man's life is in my hands."
7122,Don't you worry about that.  I got it covered.  Okay?,Yeah.
7123,What? You?,Yes.
7124,[flashback] Are you from another planet?,"[flashback] Boy, have you lost your mind? 'Cause I'll help you find it."
7125,"[flashback] Boy, have you lost your mind? 'Cause I'll help you find it.",[flashback] Did I stutter?
7126,[flashback] Did I stutter?,[flashback] I'm done. Goodbye.
7127,"A-B-C. Okay?  And hat stands for... airway, breathing and circulation.","Okay, you know what? That could be a little confusing, because in sales A-B-C means 'always be closing.'"
7128,"Okay, you know what? That could be a little confusing, because in sales A-B-C means 'always be closing.'",This is a farce. I should be teaching this course.
7129,Would you like to try next?,Absolutely I would not.
7130,You know who I really think should go? Stanley.,"Oh, I don't know."
7131,No rest for the sick. We are not always going to be there to coddle your heart back when it disappears to be working.  What are you gonna do if you're by yourself and your heart stops?,I would die.
7132,And you're okay with that?,I'm okay with the logic of it.
7133,"So, assessing the situation.  Are they breathing?","No, Rose. They are not breathing.  And they have no arms or legs."
7134,"Where are they?  You know what? If we come across somebody with no arms or legs do we bother resuscitating them? I mean, what kind of quality of life do we have there?",I would want to live with no legs.
7135,"How about no arms? No arms or legs is basically how you exist right now, Kevin. You don't do anything.","All right, well, lets get back to it. 'Cause you're losing him. Okay, too fast. Everyone, we need to pump at a pace of a 100 beats per minute ."
7136,"okay, that's uh, hard to keep track.  How many is that per hour?",How's that gonna help you?
7137,How's that gonna help you?,I will divide and then count to it.
7138,"Okay. Well, a good trick is to pump to the tune of 'Staying Alive' by the Bee Gees.  Do you know that song?","Yes, yes I do.  I love that song. [clears throat, begins to sing] First I was afraid, I was petrified."
7139,"Okay, he's dead.  Anyone know what we do next? Anybody? Rose?",I have no idea.
7140,Anyone else?,We bury him?
7141,We bury him?,"Wrong. Ehh. Check for an organ donor card.  If he has one, we only have minutes to harvest."
7142,What are you-- [people are yelling] What are you doing?,We search for the organs. Where's the heart? The precious heart.
7143,We search for the organs. Where's the heart? The precious heart.,I'm not feeling well.  I need to sit down.
7144,Are you okay?,Oh my God! [Dwight has cut the face off the CPR dummy and put it over his own]
7145,Clarice?,Oh my God!
7146,Could you tell me why you had to cut the face off the dummy?,"I didn't think it was very realistic in the movie and it turns out, it's pretty realistic."
7147,Five thousand three hundred dollars for a dummy?,Wow.
7148,[after Pam checks her cell phone] What's going on?,"Uh, no one really knows, but Pam's parents are going through a little bit of a rough patch in their marriage."
7149,Hmm? Who? Sam?,Yeah.
7150,"I mean, they just need to communicate, you know?  If they said to each other what they're saying to everyone else, then--",Hmm.
7151,"Hi, everyone.  Corporate has given Dwight two strikes. They are very, very upset with him. So, as a disciplinary measure he is going to have to issue a formal apology. Dwight, have you prepared your statement of regret?",I have.
7152,You couldn't of memorized that?,"I could not, because I do not feel it. Okay, everyone. I am going to need you to sign this statement of regret as an acknowledgement that you heard it.  Okay? Everyone come on up here. It's not a big deal."
7153,"I could not, because I do not feel it. Okay, everyone. I am going to need you to sign this statement of regret as an acknowledgement that you heard it.  Okay? Everyone come on up here. It's not a big deal.",It is a big deal. You almost killed Stanley.
7154,"Yeah, right. I filled him full of butter and sugar for 50 years and forced him not to exercise. Now, take a lesson from Stanley and jog on up here and sign this, okay?  Make a line. Just form a line right here.  Sign it!  Sign it now!","Hi dad. Yeah Jim has shaving cream, check our bathroom."
7155,"I uh, I'm sorry I didn't uh, realize you were in a bath.  Do you want me to go?",I want you to stay.
7156,[to Pam] Can you believe this? [pause] He was pretty talkative at breakfast.,"Yeah... but... eh... breakfast? You mean when they were eating soup? I don't think that was breakfast. Unless soup, does soup symbolize breakfast?"
7157,"Yeah... but... eh... breakfast? You mean when they were eating soup? I don't think that was breakfast. Unless soup, does soup symbolize breakfast?",So he doesn't share it with his daughter but he shares it with his daughter's fiance?
7158,So he doesn't share it with his daughter but he shares it with his daughter's fiance?,"You guys, they're making out."
7159,"Um, did my dad say anything about my mom?","Mmm... nope, we mostly just talked about cereal."
7160,What?,"I dunno. I mean, maybe he'll talk to you about some of this stuff 'cause he can't really talk to me about it."
7161,"What? [opens her eyes, Michael is standing over her] Oh...","And you walk up toward the castle, and inside the castle are 4 men, and each of them, none of them have shoes, and they give you a funny cigarette, and you feel even more relaxed, and then you want ice cream. You want a big bowl of ice cream. What kind do you want? Shout it out."
7162,"And you walk up toward the castle, and inside the castle are 4 men, and each of them, none of them have shoes, and they give you a funny cigarette, and you feel even more relaxed, and then you want ice cream. You want a big bowl of ice cream. What kind do you want? Shout it out.",Chunky monkey.
7163,"Racism is dead Stanley, you can have any kind of ice cream you want. What do you want? [beeping starts] What is that? People! Please I told you to get rid of the cell phones.",It's my bio-feedback machine..
7164,"Oh, ok. What is that, like, a video game?",It alerts me when my stress level goes up so I can try to calm down.
7165,You have stress?,Yes...
7166,During our relaxation exercise?,Let me get you some water.
7167,"Ok... I think that thing is on the fritz. Ahh... Oscar, would you reach over and touch his thing? That's what HE said! Right guys, 'cause of gay? [Oscar has Stanley's monitor now] Let's give this a shot.",Hellloo... [beeping speeds up as Michael gets closer]
7168,"Dunder Mifflin this is Pam. Oh, hey Mom. No, what did Dad say?",What did you say to my dad?
7169,What did you say to my dad?,What?
7170,What?,"After you talked, he called my mom and said he was gonna look for an apartment."
7171,What could Jim have said to make my dad want to leave my mom? And at what point in our marriage is he gonna say it to me?,I don't get it. Do I stress you out?
7172,I don't get it. Do I stress you out?,Nothing stresses me out. Except having to seek the approval of my inferiors.
7173,"Ok everybody, I've figured it out. The reason that you are all so stressed around me is that you are too intimidated to tell me what you really think. [Jim shakes his head at the camera] You are keeping these feelings inside, and that is what's causing stress. So, what is the solution? Solution is honesty, laughter, and comedy. In short...",A vacation.
7174,"What? No. No, I am talking about a roast! Of Michael Scott! Oh c'mon! Who here has the Comedy Central Roast channel? You've seen it right? Everybody gets together, and everyone starts hurling insults at the one guy, and everybody's laughing, and everybody's hugging each other...",Michael are you serious? You really want us to roast you?
7175,Michael are you serious? You really want us to roast you?,Si senor.
7176,"May I have your attention please? Sign in, sign in on the sign in sheet, the clipboard. This meeting is mandatory, if you do not sign in your name will not be counted. Thank you.","Hey, this is your apology letter."
7177,Michael? You ran over me with your car. You posted a picture of my bare boobs on the bulletin board with a caption that said 'Gross'...,Well...

7179,Ok. Remember Spider face?,No.
7180,Are you calling me an idiot?,Idiot.
7181,"Hey, ya know what? Forgive me for caring. Right?","Well, ya know, Michael is a great delegator. He never does any work himself. Ever. And one time, I walked in on him naked, and his thing is so small. [quickly walks off stage] If it were an iPod it would be a shuffle! [clapping, laughter]"
7182,"Mike claims, we're all a family isn't that right?","We are, we are a family."
7183,"Ok, so um, what's his name? All the way in the back there.",Oh very funny.
7184,What's his name?,Uhh... hehe hah! I'm thinking Roy?
7185,Uhh... hehe hah! I'm thinking Roy?,Roy left years ago. What's his name?
7186,Roy left years ago. What's his name?,I don't believe I have had the pleasure.
7187,"Dunder Mifflin this is Pam. Uh, I'm sorry, Michael's not here right now can I take a message? Great. I will. Thanks.","It's very unusual for Michael not to show up to work. My guess? He's either deeply depressed, or an icicle has snapped off his roof and impaled his brain. He has this terrible habit of standing directly underneath them and staring up at them. And I always say Michael, take two steps back, and stare at the icicle from the side. And he's like no, I like the way they look from standing directly underneath them."

7190,What's a text?,[at a park throwing whole pieces of bread] Caw... caw... caw caw... caw...
7191,"[movie] Sam, Sam Sam. It's not that you dumped my granddaughter, and its not that you want children. It, it's that you lied to me. Can't you see that? Can't you see? Oh, I can never trust you. [Andy looks like he's going to cry]","Lilly no. Lilly! Lilly please! Lilly STOP! I don't care how much time we have left. I don't care what my friends say! And I don't care what your mom thinks! Frankly I'm pretty sure she's not makin any sense. Please. Move back to my apartment. [Andy's crying, 'I'm All Out of Love' starts playing] Lilly. I'm not giving up. I'm not giving up. Lilly... Lilly! Push the reverse button! Reverse the button!"
7192,So what did he say? Was it my fault?,"Yeah. He said that you told him how much you love me. About how you feel when I walk in a room, and about how, you've never doubted for a second that I'm the woman you want to spend the rest of your life with. I guess he's never felt that with my mom, even at their best."
7193,You ok?,Yeah. [they hug]
7194,Hey. Why are you wearing a turtleneck?,Are you alright?
7195,Are you alright?,"Michael, I feel like I was a little harsh yesterday. [murmurs of agreement]"

7204,"You ready? And we're off, like a herd of turtles.","Well, Pam and I have eloped. Actually we just robbed a bank, and we are on the lam. [laughs] No, uh,  seriously, I am on a lecture circuit. Apparently Scranton has the best sales of any regional branch. So David Wallace has asked me to go to all the branches, except Nashua, still a little bit raw there. Um, but I am going to these branches and sharing my secret recipe for success. My 11 business herbs and spices, in a sales batter. [looks at Pam] Oh that, well, that is Pam.

7206,Oh yeah? Screw you too.,Whoa! What was that all about.

7224,Have you collected the money from everyone?,I am working on it.
7225,How much do you have?,Six dollars.
7226,"[on cell phone] NO! Oh, my God. Oh, No. That is so awful. That is the worst news. I have to go. I have to do a presentation. I'll talk to you... [hangs up phone, sighs] This is going to be hard for me to speak today. Because I just learned that my father has died. ... No, he didn't! He is alive. And this isn't even a cell phone. This is a calculator. But you bought it! And now you can't return it. Or can you? No you can't. [Karen raises her hand] Yes. Karen, do you need to go pump?","Not gonna have to do that, till after I have the baby. No, I am wondering. What are you talking about?"

7228,Would a liar bring mini Mounds bars? [Pam tosses a handful of Mounds bars at everyone],"I am a theatrical person. Growing up, I always thought I would become an actor. Because I have, these memorization tricks that I use. Um, for instance, I learned the Pledge of Allegiance by setting it to the tune of Old MacDonald. [starts singing] I pledge allegiance to the flag of the United States of America, and to the republic for which it stands, one nation under God. With a woof-woof here, and a woof-woof there.

Are you crazy?
7232,Four Splenda. Are you crazy?,"Well, No, I actually only put in two. But that's not how the songs goes."
7233,Are you out of your damn mind?,"Are you out of your damn mind? You bring an angel like that into this office, and you don't even set me up with her."

7245,"Have I ever steered you wrong, Jim?","Wait, what?"
7246,"Wait, what?","I would give that lecture a solid B+. Although, for the record, Karen. Wow, kind of mean."
7247,"Really? No, honestly. Tell me what you really think.","I'm serious. Um, I'm really glad I came."
7248,Why?,"Because, um, cause I'll never wonder ever again. If I did something wrong and... Now I have closure. She's happy and, I don't know, it feels good."

7308,"That was weird, huh? It's all part of the presentation. It was confusing, right? Because confusing situations happen to us all the time in our jobs.

7318,"Look, is there a birthday you remember that you loved?","Here's one. It was dark, warm, wet. A sudden burst of light. An intense pressure like I'd never felt before. Father, dressed in white, pulls me forward. Mother bites the cord. [pretends to bite]"
7319,"Schrutes don't celebrate birthdays, idiot. It started as a Depression-era practicality, and then moved on to an awesome tradition that I look forward to every year. [rolls eyes] What about you?","Actually, when I was seven, my Dad took me to the Natural History Museum in New York. And we looked at fossils all day.

7360,"One time. You love bringing up that one time, don't you?",Yes I do.

You're like the guy who invented the seat belt.","These people need love and I am going to get it for them  Who cares if we sell a little bit less paper today?  A great boss cares more about the happiness of his employees then anything else.  I am going to be cupid, and I am going to shoot my sparrow at unsuspecting victims, and they are going to get hit and say 'I'm in love I was hit by cupid's sparrow.'

7389,"Pardon me, may I have a chocolate chip cookie?  I gave blood earlier and I'm still feeling woozy.",Of course. [noticing Stanley's arm] That's weird.  You got a cotton ball and tape and we've been using Band-Aids.

7406,Why is it so bad for me to call and ask her to lunch today?,"[sighs] You're making it too easy for her. You're just conveying, 'Oh I like you just the way you are.'"
7407,What are you doing?,Huh?
7408,Huh?,"[to Kevin] Why don't you just go out on a date with her? Try to spark up an on going joke and then in a month or two, if it feels right, you'll know."

7418,How do you not spread out the tickets into different shipments?,I thought I did. So...
7419,Sir. I placed a bunch of golden tickets into five separate boxes and some how they all ended up with Blue Cross. How does this happen?,Were the boxes near each other?

7424,"Michael, what do you think shutting down a branch is?","Alright, then we're screwed. I am just a net that traps all of your crappy subconscious ideas and adds a little bit of my own childhood memories and whimsy, so -"
7425,Well you know what Jim? It is not my fault that you bought a house to impress Pam. That is why carnations exist.,That's not why.
7426,Does that mean an idea that blows up in our faces later? [Pam's phone rings],Good one.
7427,"OK, don't get that. Please? [Pam gets up to answer her phone]",I've got a golden ticket idea. Why don't you skip on up to the roof and jump off?

7430,How are you doing?,Fine. What is going on?
7431,Fine. What is going on?,[reading from computer] My colonoscopy was an examination of my large colon and the distal part of my small bowel with a camera.
7432,"Why did you OK this golden ticket idea? We're going to lose a fortune, Michael. How could you let this happen?","Well, there is an explanation that involves me not letting it happen and I just don't... I don't know."

7444,[puts hand on Jim's hand] Like that?,"No, stop it."
7445,"OK, what am I thinking right now?","Umm, nacho chips."
7446,"Why do you even want to stay at Dunder Mifflin? I mean what's the point? You're cooped up in there all day. You don't get to do your farming. You're not dating Angela anymore.

Are you gonna do this thing for me? Dwight? [David knocks on Michael's door and opens door] Hey David, how are you? Good to see you. Nice surprise. Dwight and I were just having a very unfortunate conversation.",That's too bad.
7450,"Yes it is, but it had to be done, didn't it?","Hopefully, nothing that can't be undone because Dwight I owe you an apology. The head of Blue Cross just called. They were so excited about the golden ticket discount that they have decided to make Dunder Mifflin their exclusive provider of all office supplies. Congratulations Dwight.

7472,"Jim! Enough with the classy, ok?","I just feel like after fifteen years at this company, bravo by the way, that we should celebrate with a very classy event, a night to remember."
7473,"Michael, you're just agreeing with him because he's wearing a tux. Don't you see what he's doing here?","Last week, Dwight sent out a memo about the dress code. So, this is me showing him that I'm taking it very seriously."
7474,"Ok, how about this? An ice sculpture, shaped like you, covered in chocolate-covered strawberries.","Oh, Dwight, you're trying too hard, and that's just not classy. You see, the thing about classy is it's a state of mind."

7497,What gave you that idea?,It was my understanding.
7498,"Listen, why don't we just leave that position vacant? Truth be told, I think I thrive under a lack of accountability.","Look, Michael, Charles is very qualified. Get to know him. I really think the two of you are going to make a great team."

That doesn't seem right to me. That doesn't seem fair. And I think that I've earned more than that."
7548,"We will move some money around, and I will personally see to it that you have your party, you have your figs. I will be in attendance. It's gonna be great. How's that?",[gets up to shake David's hand] I quit.

7769,A guarantee of what?,Just say the word.
7770,"Who would have thought, that the thing that would save this company would be work? And pancakes? In the end, this day definitely had its ups and downs. I realize that we don't have the biggest office. Which is a surprise, because 165 square feet sounds like a lot. But, we have people with the biggest hearts.

7801,Is it Stanley?,"Hey, Andy. You know I've been thinkin about what you said-"
7802,"That's interesting, because I hear what you're saying is that you want to do it, which means you can do it. Believe me, I broke up with Angela, and I'm like, the happiest guy ever.

7841,"Dwight, do you mind if we talk?",Sure. That'd be fine.
7842,Really?,"Yes. He does not have the authority to say that. I, on the other hand, am the president, the owner, and the founder. It is like you are buying software from Bill Gates."
7843,Are you saying you invented paper?,"[hugging a crying Jim] Okay, okay."
7844,"Excuse me, can I have your attention, everyone? Here's the deal, everybody, Jim Halpert is very upset and disturbed.

This doesn't feel as important though. That's just how the world works, I guess."

7858,It's good. But won't it feel weird cutting into a cross?,"Don't think of it as a cross in the Judeo-Christian sense, think of it more as a symbol of your lives crossing in marriage."

Nothing to fear.  I am just a 44 year old guy with a paper route.","[honking horn] Time to make the donuts. [laughs and drives away as Ryan tries to get in the van]  Come on.  Whoa! No, I promise I won't do it again.  Come on.  [does it again] De-nied!"
7864,"You didn't happen to bring any coffee, did you, Michael?",Milk and sugar.
7865,"Oh, awesome.  You're a life saver.  [drinks from coffee cup] Wait, is this just milk and sugar?",That's what I said.
7866,Do you drink this every day?,Every morning.
7867,"Okay, who covers Bans Pet Grooming?","Oh, they're my client."
7868,What are we supposed to do?  They keep undercutting us on price.,I don't want to hear excuses.  I want to see improvements.  This is unacceptable.
7869,Why are you telling me this?,I just think the bar should be lower for a newbie.
7870,Is this something you really want to have said?,I don't want to have said that.  But I think it's important that you know it.
7871,You know what we need?  We need some couches in here.,"Michael, we should really consider getting a delivery guy."
7872,"Oh, you know what you would love? Is if we built a loft.",Why would I love that? Can we afford a delivery guy?
7873,Why would I love that? Can we afford a delivery guy?,"Like in a dorm room.  You put your desk underneath, you have your loft up top.  You can sleep up top."
7874,"Would you let Charles know that David is here, please?  Jim, hey.","Hey, David."
7875,There he is. There he is.  How was the trip up?,"A lot better than a month at the Scranton Radisson, I'm sure."
7876,Okay?,"Maybe, and I don't know, if you had just returned Michael's call none of us would've lost clients."
7877,"I've been wondering that myself lately.  We're just gonna get started, we're gonna figure this out. Rest assured.  Jim, can you come in with us please?","Uh, Jim hold on. [whispers] You know, David, uh, Dwight's been my guy.  Okay?"
7878,"Uh, Jim hold on. [whispers] You know, David, uh, Dwight's been my guy.  Okay?",Hmm.
7879,How much can we afford to pay a delivery guy?,"Well, if these numbers you gave me are correct--"
7880,Why do you think Staples and Dunder Mifflin can't match your prices?,Corporate greed?
7881,Corporate greed?,"Look, our price model is fine. I reviewed the numbers myself.  Over time with enough volume, we become profitable."
7882,Did it help?,"Hi, Jerry.  Michael Scott.  Well, this is slightly embarrassing. [laughs] Um, I'm going to have to... ask you to pay me a little bit more money for that delivery we dropped off yesterday.  Yeah. We did. We got the check, but we're just going to need a much, much bigger check."
7883,"Now, would corporate approve a temporary price reduction for returning customers?","God, no."
7884,Really? Does he do good work or--,"[scoffs] No, Jim. I use a bad apiarist. [sighs]"
7885,"Okay.  Hey, Dwight.  Can I talk to you?",Sure thing.
7886,You're just out of business?,We have maybe a month.  I don't know what I'm gonna do.
7887,"Good, right?  Hello.","[over phone] Idiot, we're starting back up.  This is Dwight, by the way."
7888,Did I ever tell you about the day that Steve Martin died?,"Steve Martin's not dead, Michael."
7889,You want to hear something sad?,I would love that.
7890,Really?,I went to Fort Lauderdale.
7891,Was it nice?,"Yeah, it was amazing.  There was a great Pad Thai place, though."
7892,"Now, this is the projection over three months?",We still have the inventory sitting-- [everyone starts chattering at once]
7893,"Let me float something out there, okay?  Can I just say-- can I say something?","Yeah, yeah."
7894,What is wrong with you?,"Jim, you're-- you're pretty close with him.  You think they'd be up for hearing an offer?"
7895,"Jim, you're-- you're pretty close with him.  You think they'd be up for hearing an offer?","Oh, I don't know. You know, they've taken a good deal of clients, so--"
7896,"You know what?  Why don't I do it, okay? Michael adores me.  I'm the man for this job.  Charles, you got my back on this?","No, Jim... I think you should go."
7897,[knocking on door] Hmm?,"Hey, can I talk to you guys for a second?"
7898,"Hey, can I talk to you guys for a second?","We're not hiring, Jim."
7899,"You know I love a good guessing game, but why don't I just tell you what I'm here for?  Turns out you guys have made a pretty big dent in the Dunder Mifflin sales.","Oh, that's nice."
7900,Seriously?  Are you being serious?,"He's bluffing, Pam."
7901,Never accept their first offer.  What is your second offer?,"$12,000.00"
7902,Are you kidding me?  That is insultingly low.  I don't even want to hear what your first offer was.,What do you hear?
7903,What do you hear?,[mumbles]
7904,"Okay, now I don't know that I can get this. I do have to go to the board for approval. How's about $60,000.  Hmm?  $60,0000.  Michael?",[stutters] We'll have to talk--
7905,What?,We'll have to talk about this.
7906,Are you kidding me?,"Well, Jerry, the one who got away.  May I ask why you're leaving the Michael Scott Paper Company?  Really?  Please hold.  [gets up and runs to kitchen]  Charles."
7907,"Well, Jerry, the one who got away.  May I ask why you're leaving the Michael Scott Paper Company?  Really?  Please hold.  [gets up and runs to kitchen]  Charles.",Dwight.
7908,May I have your attention?  The Michael Scott Paper Company is broke.,What?  How'd you hear that?
7909,What?  How'd you hear that?,They've been calling all of their clients and begging them to pay more money.  That can only mean one thing.  They're desperate.  Which can only mean one thing.  They're total failures.
7910,"No, I mean, great detective work.  'Cause this must be the first case you've ever cracked, right?","You don't crack a case.  That has pejorative connotation.  That's like calling a policeman a cop.  You solve a case, and yes, I've solved plenty."
7911,So how long can they stay viable?,What are your top five cases?
7912,What are your top five cases?,I'm gonna answer Charles first.
7913,Because you have embarrassed me for the last time today.  Got it?,I'm not-- I'm not following you.
7914,"So you've thought it over, yes, and you accept our offer.  We can finally put this whole thing behind us?  Hmm?",No.
7915,Can you give us another minute please?,Yeah.
7916,"How could you do this to me, Michael?  You just cost me $60,000.",Why are you assuming you'd get the whole thing?
7917,Why are you assuming you'd get the whole thing?,"It's a lot of money, okay.  But we need money coming in every week.  We need jobs.  Wouldn't you rather have a fishing pole than a fish?"
7918,"It's a lot of money, okay.  But we need money coming in every week.  We need jobs.  Wouldn't you rather have a fishing pole than a fish?","I would rather have $60,000, honestly."
7919,Agreed?,"Agreed.  But that's all, okay."
7920,"Shut up, shut up.  Hello?",I want my old job back.  I want my old parking space back.  I want a Sebring.
7921,Do you realize what you're asking for here?  You're talking about salary plus health benefits--,And dental this time.
7922,Okay.  Deal.  Okay?,Can we have the room please?
7923,Can we have the room please?,"Yeah. [David and Charles leave room, Michael shuts the door and closes the blinds]"
7924,Yes! Can you believe it?  That's what I'm talking about!,There are certain defining moments in a person's life.  The day he is born.  The day he grows hair.  The day he starts a business. And the day he sells that business back to Dunder Mifflin.  What have I learned from all of this?  It is far too early to tell.  I just know that I am flying high and I don't even want to think about it.  I just want to enjoy it.
7925,There are certain defining moments in a person's life.  The day he is born.  The day he grows hair.  The day he starts a business. And the day he sells that business back to Dunder Mifflin.  What have I learned from all of this?  It is far too early to tell.  I just know that I am flying high and I don't even want to think about it.  I just want to enjoy it.,"Hey, guys--"
7926,"Someone is returning!  He started his own company, and now he's back.  Who could it be? I'll give you a hint.  He is a man.  A man you have missed with all your heart.  A man who has ruined all other men for you.  Who is it?",[whispering] Who is it?
7927,[whispering] Who is it?,[whispering] Who is it?
7928,[whispering] Who is it?,"[whispering] It's Michael Scott.  [applause; Michael jumps through sign] Hold it up.  Conference room, five minutes."
7929,"Well, I guess the first order of business is to welcome back me, and Pam and Ryan.  [scattered applause] And how about casual Friday again, huh?  Reinstituting casual Friday?  You all look great.  What I want to do right now is try something a little different.  I'm going to throw it out there, starting with this meeting.  I want you guys to run it.  I want you to say whatever you want,  take it away.  Your meeting.",[after a few moments of silence]  Wh--what are you doing?
7930,[after a few moments of silence]  Wh--what are you doing?,"If there is something that you would like to say as a group, then by all means, you may say it to me right now."
7931,Can you give us a hint?,"When I needed salespeople for my new paper company,  everyone here turned their back on me.  Am I going to ask them to beg for forgiveness?  No. Am I going to ask for big, crying apology? No.  Am I going to ask them to slit their wrists for me? No.  I just want a tiny, microscopic version of that."
7932,"When I needed salespeople for my new paper company,  everyone here turned their back on me.  Am I going to ask them to beg for forgiveness?  No. Am I going to ask for big, crying apology? No.  Am I going to ask them to slit their wrists for me? No.  I just want a tiny, microscopic version of that.","Oscar, what were you going to say?"
7933,"Oscar, what were you going to say?",Nothing.  I didn't say anything.
7934,Do I still have a job here?,"Not important. [everyone mutters] Okay, alright.  Yes. Yes, you have a job.  Frankly, you have a job because Ryan and Pam are starting with us as salesmen."
7935,"Wait, what?",How is that going to work?
7936,How is that going to work?,"It's going to work very smoothly, because Pam and Ryan are bringing over a ton of clients from Michael Scott Paper Company and--"
7937,"Yeah , aren't we getting those clients back?","No, you lost those clients."
7938,"Okay, Dwight.  Let me explain something to you.  I set the rules and you follow them.  Blindly. Okay?   And if you have a problem with that then you can talk to our complaint department.  It's a trash can.","[to Ryan] Don't fall in love with me, kid."
7939,[laughs]  Boscov's at the Steamtown Mall?,It sure looked good on the mannequin.
7940,What?,Isn't that what you said to a bunch of my clients when you were stealing them?  That I didn't have enough time for them?
7941,Isn't that what you said to a bunch of my clients when you were stealing them?  That I didn't have enough time for them?,"Oh, I, um..."
7942,Can't you just not look at his feet?,"Excuse me? Oh. You're so educated, aren't you Toby?  So trained to deal with a hysterical woman.  I don't want to look at his feet.  [storms off] Do your job!"
7943,"Excuse me? Oh. You're so educated, aren't you Toby?  So trained to deal with a hysterical woman.  I don't want to look at his feet.  [storms off] Do your job!","Well, I was in the Seminary for a year and dropped out 'cause I wanted to have sex with this girl, Cathy.  Followed her to Scranton.  Took the first job I could find in H.R.  Later she divorced me.  So no, I wouldn't say I have a passion for H.R."
7944,"Okay, what are you still doing at your desk?",What are you still doing not at your desk?
7945,What are you still doing not at your desk?,Did you even read the memo?
7946,Did you even read the memo?,All my files are now in reverse alphabetical order--
7947,"We're in crisis mode here, do you understand?  The two unqualified so-called salespeople are being favored because they all failed together.  And frankly, I'm not convinced that Michael and Pam didn't have a thing going while they were gone.",Can I address that?
7948,Can I address that?,"No, you're too close."
7949,"Stanley, how do you feel about those two taking your clients?",It's not right.  I don't like it.
7950,"Her face is okay, but-- Jesus!  What --what are you doing here?",I don't know.  I saw a crowd.  I thought there might be a dogfight or something--
7951,Of course.  What is like a hostage?,Excellent question.
7952,"Can I just say something?  I know that tempers are high, but I think the best way to handle this might be to just talk to Michael directly.","Oh.  Well, that--that's a great idea, Jim.  Oh, I totally see your point.  Okay, we'll talk to Michael directly.  So uh,  meeting is over, I guess.  I'll see everyone upstairs."
7953,I do?  Well--Where is that bowl?,"Hey, you have a second?"
7954,"Hey, you have a second?",Michael Scott Paper Company only.
7955,Against who?,You.  Us.
7956,What?,It's gotta be because they all want their clients.
7957,"It's crazy what's going on out there today, huh?","I know.  Yeah, it's...kinda--"
7958,Want to play a game?,Hey gang. Where you been?
7959,Hey gang. Where you been?,Lunch.
7960,Where'd you eat?,A restaurant.
7961,"What'd you have, Stanley?","I had a salmon salad.  With water, no ice.  I was going to get a soda, but the waiter talked me out of it.  Her name was Flo, she had black hair."
7962,"So since you guys already ate, you won't be eating the stuff you brought with you for lunch, will you?  [walks into kitchen] Oh, wow, Stanley.  Is that egg salad?  Andy brought some salmon.",That looks great.
7963,"Dwight, is that a meat sandwich?  You guys hungry?",I can eat.
7964,Mom. What kind of sauce is on your salmon?,Dijonnaise.
7965,"Hey, Meredith.  Can I talk to you privately for a second?",About what?
7966,About what?,Your outfit.
7967,What? What's wrong with my outfit?,You--you might consider pulling it down a touch.  It's ri--it's riding up a little high.
7968,"A bunch of prudes.  You know, Oscar's allowed to wear sandals,  but I'm not allowed to wear open-toed shoes?  [pulls down dress, office gasps]  Is that how it goes?","Meredith, your boob is out."
7969,"Dammit, Meredith, where are your panties?","It's casual day.  Happy?  [bends over to get a file, exposing herself to the office]"
7970,"It's casual day.  Happy?  [bends over to get a file, exposing herself to the office]","[playing chess with Jim]  No. IF you do that, I'm gonna do that.  IF you do that, I'm gonna do that.  IF you do this, I'm gonna do that."
7971,"Well, what if I just do this?",You don't want to do that.
7972,"I'm sorry you feel that way, Mr. Bart.  Is there anything I can do to make things better?","Whoa, whoa, whoa, whoa, whoa, whoa.  Give me the phone.  Give me the phone."
7973,Who let this boy on the phone?,Ah! Mr. Bart!  Ugh! [slams phone down[ I cannot believe you lost that account.  He was my client for ten years!
7974,You're a secretary! What do you know?,Okay.
7975,"Hey, hey guys.  You know what I want you to do?  Shake hands, get over it.  That was not a shake, Dwight.","We want our clients back or we quit, Michael."
7976,Who quits?,Me.
7977,You want us to apologize to you?,Yes I do.
7978,Gasp.  Are you talking about a secret meeting?,Whatever you guys did earlier.
7979,"Just do it, okay?",I'll do--
7980,Are you kidding me?,Deceit does not come easy to me.
7981,Are you giving us our clients back?,"If we could just focus and go down the line, and everyone would say,  'apology accepted', I think we would all feel better.  And then we can break out  my gift to you--complimentary white chocolate bark."
7982,So?,"Fine, have your clients.  I can see that's what you wanted all along.  [everyone mutters 'okay'] However, I rescind my apology."
7983,What'd I tell you about building forts in my warehouse?,"Michael gave all of our clients back to their old salespeople, so now there's not enough for both me and Pam to stay on."
7984,"If you really think that, will you tell that to Michael?  That would go a long way coming from you.",Yeah.
7985,Then why would you want to set me up with your daughter?,I don't know.
7986,Jim. Can I talk to you for a minute?,Sure.  Let me just finish this turn.
7987,"Eh, she's nice, I guess.  You know what?  Best thing to do, Pros and Cons list.","Pro for Ryan, he went to business school, he's my number one choice."
7988,I have a very difficult decision to make.  It's like last week I was at the video store.  Do I rent Devil Wears Prada again? Or do I finally get around to seeing Sophie's Choice?  It is what you would call a classic difficult decision.,"You don't understand clothing, Toby.  You're dressed like this amorphous blob of khaki."
7989,"Listen up, Flenderson.  You're being weak and ineffectual.  I'm cowboying this meeting, okay?  Here are the new rules.  Earth tones only.  Also, women are forbidden to wear pants.","All right, come.  Sit down, Dwight."
7990,"Ooh, where has this guy been?",Casual Fridays are cancelled.  [everyone protests]  Let's just not do it anymore.
7991,"Pam, can you come in here, please?  Have a seat.  [clears throat] Well, there's no easy way of saying this.  So I think I will just...drag it out.  Since the dawn of time there has been--",Just tell me.
7992,"Okay, I get it. [Michael laughs] Why are you giggling?  Is this a joke?  [Michael continues to laugh] Michael, is this-- did I get the job?","[laughing] Yes, you did."
7993,I did?,Yep.
7994,"For real, you're not kidding?","No, you--no."
7995,I did?,"No, you're the best person for the job.  You're going to be great."
7996,"Oh, really?",Yeah.  'Cause you said I didn't
7997,What about Ryan?,"I don't know, I offered him his temp job back.  We'll see.  He was not happy at all when I offered him this job and then I told him he didn't get the job, so--"
7998,Oh! What's our receptionists name?,Erin.
7999,Could you send her in?,[opens door] Erin.  Michael wants to see you.
8000,"This is very difficult to say, but no one here like you in the office and we are going to have to let you go.  [pick up phone] Hank, could you come up here please?  Hank is our security guard--","Oh, I can go."
8001,"Do they not like me, though?","I don't know, actually."
8002,"Guys, I'm scared. I'm really scared. I think I'm growing into a giant. Because look at this normal sized coffee cup. Looks so tiny in my giant hand now. Anybody want to go to lunch with me later on?",I do.
8003,Okay. How about a woman? Pam?,"Oh, I can't do lunch. I was just sending you an email. Jim and I need to leave early today to meet with our contractor."
8004,"Oh, really? Ok.",Just sent it.
8005,What about the rest of you? [complete silence],"At Dunder-Mifflin there is a very strict no lunch with the boss policy and I don't know who instituted it. I think it started right after my predecessor stepped down, but at the Michael Scott Paper Company I really enjoyed having lunch with Pam and Ryan everyday. So, rules be damned, I wanna have lunch with these people."
8006,Who else? Who else? Ryan?,I don't do lunch. I'm eating five small meals a day now.
8007,Ok. Anyone? Anyone? At all? Accounting? I am accounting on you to go to lunch with me.,No. I don't want to stay late to have a two hour lunch.
8008,What?,Work.
8009,Ugh! God! What happened to you people? [talking like a robot] We are just office drones. We are office drones. All we do is work... is work.,"If you don't take out his battery, he just keeps going all day."
8010,"Hi, guys. How you doing?","Erin, how many times do I have to tell you? It is not necessary for you to ask us how we are doing every time you interact with us."
8011,"Erin, how many times do I have to tell you? It is not necessary for you to ask us how we are doing every time you interact with us.",Right. I'm sorry.
8012,"[sighs] Now, how can I help you?","Did somebody here leave a map in the printer to Youngstown, Ohio?"
8013,"Did somebody here leave a map in the printer to Youngstown, Ohio?","Attention, office. Who here is planning a trip to Youngstown, Ohio? I will take your silence to mean that you are all hiding something. This location is the Superior Court -"
8014,"Attention, office. Who here is planning a trip to Youngstown, Ohio? I will take your silence to mean that you are all hiding something. This location is the Superior Court -",So someone is going to a court. Big deal.
8015,"Ok. Right. Oh, so this morning we are having breakfast together and I just looked up from my cereal and I said, ' You know what I want to do today? I want to marry you.'",I had just woken up. I didn't look cute. That's how I knew he meant it.
8016,Michael? Michael sorry to bother you. Are you going to be working down here? Do you want these down here now?,No work. No work. No work. I come in here to release frustration. Ooh. Ah. Ah. Ah. Ooh.
8017,"Now you got it. Hey, you want some espresso?","Oh, yeah."
8018,Andy's afwaid?,Yes.
8019,Are you all afwaid?,No.
8020,What?,Funk is the problem and the solution.
8021,Is this our punishment for not wanting to have lunch with you?,"Why don't you get over lunch, Oscar? Everybody else is past it."
8022,"Why don't you get over lunch, Oscar? Everybody else is past it.",[Jack Nicholson impression] All work and no play makes Michael a dull boy.
8023,This is like a haunted coffeehouse thing?,"No. Dwight is confusing you. That - it's, it's more of a disco."
8024,"So, like, a disco cafe?",Wha - No. No. Not even close. I can't force you to go down but I can entice you. I'm gonna be down there. Erin will be down there from time to time... and all-you-can-eat espresso.
8025,[to Michael] Is there a cookie?,Mmm-hmm.
8026,"Aw, what the hell? [goes to Vance Refrigeration] Hi, Jessica. Is Bob in?","Oh, he's on a call."
8027,It's pretty important. He wouldn't want to be disturbed. Can I give him a message before he gets off?,Tell him I'm going dancing downstairs in the storage closet between the bathrooms that used to be a utility shower and he should join me there.
8028,Phyllis?,Hi.
8029,"Oh, wow! What did you do?",[moans in pain]
8030,You didn't do that. You're ok. You're ok. Let's lie down. You want to go down? Alright.,Wow! Sorry!
8031,"Hey! Hey, hey, hey! I got your text. Who's Phillip?",No. No. No.
8032,Who tipped you over? Was it Phillip?,It's my back.
8033,It's her back. We just - We need - Let's - You know what?,Call a doctor.
8034,I don't need you to give me a history lesson. Ok?,What do you think history is?
8035,What do you think history is?,"It's just, we need to get her out of here because no one is going to want to go in there with a woman writhing around on the floor. Wait, wait, wait. But most importantly we need to get her some medical attention. ASAP. Stat."
8036,You having fun?,"Oh, my God! What happened?"
8037,"Oh, my God! What happened?","What? Oh, just having to much fun. Phyllis, we're going to put you in here. Dwight's going to take care of you."
8038,"What? Oh, just having to much fun. Phyllis, we're going to put you in here. Dwight's going to take care of you.",What? No. I thought we were going to the hospital.
8039,What? No. I thought we were going to the hospital.,You want to get sick you go to the hospital.
8040,What happened to Phyllis?,"Oh, you know. Nohting. She's  - we were hanging out at Cafe Disco and she had a flare up of am existing injury. But she's a tough, old bird. So..."
8041,Can you please go back to work instead of masterminding these situations were in we hurt ourselves?,Ok. Phyllis did injure herself. But she injured herself having fun and I don't think she would trade that memory for anything. [Phyllis can be heard screaming in the backgroud]
8042,You all took a life here today. you did. The life of the party. Erin?,Yes.
8043,Cafe Disco? More like Crappe Disco.,You're bad. [they turn off the lights and turn on music - start dancing]

8050,"You comfy? Alright? Alright. Relax. Relax, ok?",Dwight! Dwight!
8051,"Come on. Relax. The shirt wasn't doing you any favors. If my assessment in correct, you grind your teeth?",I do.
8052,You invited someone?,"Oh, yeah. Was I not allowed to do that?"
8053,"Oh, yeah. Was I not allowed to do that?",I've been here 8 years and I've never... [Erin walks away] Rude.
8054,Angela. Angela. Angela. May I interest you in a triple espresso or perhaps a dance?,No. I didn't come down here to get wet and wild. I just need you to sign these.
8055,An hour? I can't stay here an hour.,"Whoa! Whoa, whoa, girl. Whoa. Whoa."
8056,What's so funny?,When I say it out loud it's so silly. [they both laugh]
8057,You are forcing me to be down here. Am I not allowed to have some fun?,No... cleaning... up.
8058,You ready?,Yeah.
8059,Hey! Hey! Jim and Pam! Can you believe this? It's really happening.,"Wanna dance, Dwight?"
8060,"Wanna dance, Dwight?","Ordinarily I would say no but you need to move to reduce lactic acid build-up. Also, this song is fantastic."
8061,Mind if I steal my wife?,You can't steal what is legally your property.
8062,Are those staples?,This dance competition is not over.
8063,"What dance competition? I was just dancin' casual with my friends, y'all.",You guys are the best for coming. You don't have to stay if you don't want to. I understand.
8064,Really?,Yeah. At least for one more dance.
8065,Really?,Yeah.
8066,Would you like to dance?,No. [Camera pans to down to show her swinging her foot to the music]
8067,Are you sure that's not the 'gay' ear?,Gay ear? Are you 12 years old?
8068,Gay ear? Are you 12 years old?,"Well, I..."
8069,It was?,Yeah. It was.
8070,Hi. Did you have bacon for breakfast?,No.
8071,I didn't think I did. How's everything going?,Tight. I'm going down the hall to this office to see Michael - there's free espressos.
8072,Are you sure that you didn't eat bacon?,Yes.
8073,How did I end up back in Crazytown?,It is hard to imagine you playing softball.
8074,Oh yeah? Big deal. I once hit three home runs against Little Flower Catholic.,The girls school?
8075,The girls school?,I played high school softball. Notice I didn't say 'girls' high school softball. Not after the landmark case of Shrute vs. the Lackawanna County Board of Education.That was one case the Pennsylvania Supreme Court got right. I hit the ball right over the protest banners.
8076,"[whispering] Okay, I'm gonna go in there and change the computer. Are you sure you can change his watch?",[whispering] I can do it.
8077,[whispering] What do you need from me?,"Normally I don't condone leaving early, but I have an appointment with the horse doctor. How that horse became a doctor, I don't know. [laughs heartily] No, I'm kidding. He's just a regular doctor who shoots your horse in the head when its leg is broken."
8078,"[wakes up, joins in with the laughter] Uh oh. What's so funny?",You had to be there.
8079,"[at company picnic] All right, you ready for this?","Yeah, we walk around, everyone sees our faces and we leave, right?"
8080,"Yeah, we walk around, everyone sees our faces and we leave, right?",Yeah.
8081,"Wait, should I have left the car running? [both laugh]","Oh, don't get us wrong, we like picnics."
8082,"Come on, who doesn't like a picnic?",Tell them what happened last year.
8083,Woah. Homemade?,Of course. You think the EPA would ever allow that much DEET? [both laugh]
8084,Of course. You think the EPA would ever allow that much DEET? [both laugh],Rolph is my best friend. We met in a shoe store. I heard him asking for a shoe that could increase his speed and not leave any tracks.
8085,"Michael, isn't that Holly?","We're just friends. [approaches Holly and AJ] Hey, hey, wait a second. Who let you in here, is what I want to know."
8086,"Hi. You remember AJ, my boyfriend?","A little bit. Uh, I meet a lot of people."
8087,Hey. [hugs AJ a little too forcefully] Arrggh. So would you guys like some lemonade? Or one of you? Or both of you? Either or. The combinations are endless.,Lemonade sounds great.
8088,"Hey, how are you?",Hey Charles.
8089,"Nice day, huh?",Yeah.
8090,Do you want me to beat him up for you?,"No, I shouldn't have to ask you to do stuff like that. You should just do it."
8091,Listen up everyone! I've gone over this lineup very carefully. We cannot forget the humiliation we suffered last year at the softball game with Jim's whole spider-in-the-mitt incident. Right?,"Well, I could've died, so... I looked it up online afterwards."
8092,"Bro-migo, you think you could put Erin on my row?",Why? I don't understand.
8093,Why? I don't understand.,If-
8094,"What is up with you two, Holly?","Um, not much."
8095,Cool. For who?,For us.
8096,You guys are really gonna do this?,You bet your fat ass we are.
8097,[in a New York accent] Have ya hoyd the news? Extry! Extry! Read all about it!,Newspapers for sale!
8098,"[playing volleyball, yelling at Erin, who hit the ball out of bounds] Are you blind?! Are you blind?! [turns attention to a man on the other team] Sir, with the glasses, are you literally blind? I'm concerned you might be in danger.","These are expensive Ray-Bans, jackass."
8099,Are you blind?!,"I could've gotten that, idiot!"
8100,Can you see things with your eyeballs?!,"It's not a sledgehammer! Come on, people! We need to get our heads in the game! Let's focus! Come on, you're better than this! I am better than this! Phyllis, why are you sitting on the ground?!"
8101,"It's not a sledgehammer! Come on, people! We need to get our heads in the game! Let's focus! Come on, you're better than this! I am better than this! Phyllis, why are you sitting on the ground?!",We've been out here for a while. I don't need this.
8102,So what?,"Rule violation. Ball is ours. Give it to me. Our point. Okay. Hey, Pam, how ya doin? Hey, do you know if you're right-handed or left-handed? Or do you even know? What hand do you use to answer the phone?"
8103,"Rule violation. Ball is ours. Give it to me. Our point. Okay. Hey, Pam, how ya doin? Hey, do you know if you're right-handed or left-handed? Or do you even know? What hand do you use to answer the phone?","Back off, Dwight. [serves] Hyuh! [the opposing team misses the ball, the Scranton team cheers] What?"
8104,"Back off, Dwight. [serves] Hyuh! [the opposing team misses the ball, the Scranton team cheers] What?",Maybe I played a little in junior high... and in high school... maybe a little in college... and went to volleyball camp most summers.
8105,"Ooh, yes please. [takes a bite] Mmm. So what do you have planned for us today? Hmm?",[watching her eat] What?
8106,[watching her eat] What?,"Do you have a script for the sketch, or..."
8107,"Um, no, I just thought we'd wing it. That cool?",Crystal cool.
8108,What happened?,I... twisted it.
8109,Is there a... Meredith here?,Yeah! Man in!
8110,"Rolph, did you not hear me?","I don't hear cheaters, tramps, or women who break my friend's heart. Let's go!"
8111,Could we get a Delorean?,Jaws. They swim in the ocean and they terrorize the whole community.
8112,Are you ready to play SlumDunder Mifflinaire?,"Yes, I am."
8113,"For one hundred dollars, where did Dunder meet Mifflin? A.) On easy street, B.) a tour of Dartmouth College, C.) they never met, D.) brushing their teeth?","Ohh, I'm thinking... I'm going to say... B, tour of Dartmouth College."
8114,"That is correct! [both run to another side of the stage, acting out a different scene] How did you know that?! [pantomimes electrocuting Michael]",[screams] Ahhhh!! Ohhh!! Ahhh!! I was there! Ahhh!! I was a tour guide at Dartmouth College!! Noooo!!!
8115,[now pretending to be Dunder and Mifflin] Nice campus. Think you'll get in?,"Yeah, I'm definitely getting in. I'm a shoo-in."
8116,"Robert Mifflin had a great life. But unfortunately, had undiagnosed depression, which over nine million Americans suffer from and is very treatable. For two hundred and fifty dollars, how did he kill himself? A.) A rope, B.) a knife, C.) a gun, D.) brushing his teeth!","Two hundred and fifty dollars is more money than I've ever seen in my life. I will say, C, a gun. He shot himself in the head."

8118,[over crowd of murmurs] What is he talking about?,"[pantomimes biting off Michael's fingers, Michael screams] How did you know that?!"
8119,"[pantomimes biting off Michael's fingers, Michael screams] How did you know that?!",David Wallace told me!!
8120,"David, is this true?","Uh, okay everyone, we're at a picnic today..."
8121,"Are we losing our jobs or not, David?",They didn't know?
8122,They didn't know?,[whispers] I guess not.
8123,And?,We're- we're closing the Buffalo branch.
8124,How could you possibly think that the right way to announce a branch closing was in a comedy sketch at the company picnic?,Well... I didn't know they didn't know.
8125,"What about the fact that they're here today? What about that? That didn't throw up any alarms? No, Michael needed a little bit for his comedy sketch, and he thought, 'oh, this would be really funny.'",Thank you.
8126,"Damn it, Michael, I told you that in confidence. Now I have to go over and deal with these employees and their families. A little boy just walked up to me and said, 'is my daddy gonna have a job by Christmas?'","Well, he's just thinking about his own gifts."
8127,How do you figure?,"Because if we don't play, then the other team wins."
8128,"Kevin! Now it's seven-six, or is that too much accounting for you?",Here's an accounting question for you: what does one fiance plus one lover equal? Answer: one whore.
8129,Here's an accounting question for you: what does one fiance plus one lover equal? Answer: one whore.,"Okay, knock it off, Rolph."
8130,"What? She is sitting there, casting aspersions-","Rolph, please. I am asking nicely-"
8131,You all right?,"Yep. No, no, no, I'm fine."
8132,You sure?,Yeah.
8133,"I don't know. You know, this is a company picnic, so technically that is a company injury, you know? Safest thing to do is get that examined, right David?",Yeah.
8134,"All right, you know what? You're just trying to get rid of our best player.","Oh, Jim, you're putting a volleyball game in front of your fiance's health."
8135,"All right, you know what? [picks Pam up and carries her off the court] Let's do this.",We'll be back!
8136,How do you think it went before the Buffalo thing?,I think it went well. I think it was good.
8137,How long will that take?,"Oh, shouldn't be too bad, it's a slow day. So, no other radiation this year, no metal plates, no chance you're pregnant..."
8138,"I'm sorry, can we just hurry this up? I've got a game to get back to.","Oh good, because my next question was 'do you have a game to get back to.'"
8139,What'd you think?,"I loved it. You know, there was a part near the end that seemed like that went on a little long, but..."
8140,"Yeah, it looks like Pam won't make it back. Okay?",Okay. Fine.
8141,"Except, you know what? It's not fine. How many people need to get hurt before we learn a valuable lesson? One? Two? Three? Four?",Dwight.
8142,"No, no, hear me out. Five? Six?",Dwight.
8143,Seven? Can I finish please?,Okay.
8144,Eight?,"[on the phone] Oh, Dwight, we're so close! Just buy us a few more minutes... Well, they just called me in for an update, so I'll call you right back... Okay... Okay, great. [goes into a private room where Pam and the doctor are, the voices are inaudible, but the camera can see through a window, Pam and Jim look in shock, they hug and Jim goes back out into the hall to call Dwight back, trembling] Hey, Dwight, uh... send in the subs! [laughs] Ohh! [goes back into the room to hug Pam]"
8145,[hands Dwight a cup of water] There you go. Is there anything else I can do?,"[chugs water, throws away cup] Yes. Umm... see those files behind Kevin's desk?"
8146,"[chugs water, throws away cup] Yes. Umm... see those files behind Kevin's desk?",[nods] Mm hmm.
8147,"[to Oscar, motioning to male intern and female intern] Think she did him?","I bet there's something there. I was with them in the kitchen yesterday, and they were all too happy to be cleaning the freezer."
8148,[entering break room] Who's getting married?,Nobody.
8149,Did everybody know about this but me?,"There's nothing to know, it's just gossip."
8150,"Wait, there's not gonna be a shotgun?",Nope.
8151,"What are you gonna do about it? There's no shotgun, so... free at last, free at last!","No, keep it up."
8152,[annoyed] How do you know this?,"[still typing] People tell me things. I guess I have a face you can trust. I think it's because of my low cheekbones. And... boom. [finishes typing, turns to face Michael] Okay, what is it, what can't I guess?"
8153,"[still typing] People tell me things. I guess I have a face you can trust. I think it's because of my low cheekbones. And... boom. [finishes typing, turns to face Michael] Okay, what is it, what can't I guess?","I hate, hate, hate being left out. Whether it's not being picked for a team, or being picked for a team and showing up and realizing the team doesn't exist. Or that the sport doesn't exist? I should've known. Poopball?"
8154,"I hate, hate, hate being left out. Whether it's not being picked for a team, or being picked for a team and showing up and realizing the team doesn't exist. Or that the sport doesn't exist? I should've known. Poopball?","[to Maurie, the Asian intern] Man, I know how you feel. Third wheel. I have been the third wheel so many times in my life. My mom told me something once that made me feel a lot better. She said 'The third wheel is what makes it a tricycle.'"
8155,What are you talking about?,I'm talking about your group date with Megan and Eric.
8156,At Tink's?,Yes
8157,How'd you know about that?,Well...
8158,Did Stanley tell you?,[confused] Stanley was on your group date?
8159,[confused] Stanley was on your group date?,"No, Stanley was with his wife. I waved at him, but he didn't wave back."
8160,[laughs] Does anybody else know about this?,No.
8161,"So, what is the scuttlebutt? Anybody hear anything?",[stare blankly at Michael]
8162,Nothing? Well I got a little somethin' somethin'. I don't know if I should say...,Just keep it to yourself then.
8163,Who?,"Teri, Stanley's wife. She's at an interior decorating expo in Philly. Stanley hates crowds, kids, and music. I think you should check your facts."
8164,What are you talking about?,Stanley's wife is out of town.
8165,"Oh, was he? Well who, his sister?",[chuckles]
8166,Drugs?,Making out.
8167,WHAT??,"I am very happy right now. Thrilled perhaps, to be part of the office, to be part of the conversation. When you have somebody's attenton, and their eyes are lighting up because they are very interested in what you have to say, [Michael is seen whispering to Jim, then Pam] that is a great feeling, and I experienced that firsthand today. It is wonderful to be the center of attention."
8168,"No... no. He's holding a pencil. He could be doing a crossword puzzle with that pencil. What's that letter, right there? Same letter here and here. What haven't you guessed?",T.
8169,"[opening blinds as Stanley walks past] Hey, Stanley! Where you goin', big guy? Up to no good?",I'm meeting a client. Do you have a problem with that?
8170,I'm meeting a client. Do you have a problem with that?,"No, no, no, no. I just had a quick question for you. I'm casting a movie and I'm looking for a woman who can dance, beautiful woman. Do you know anybody?"
8171,"No, no, no, no. I just had a quick question for you. I'm casting a movie and I'm looking for a woman who can dance, beautiful woman. Do you know anybody?",Goodbye. [walks away]
8172,"[giddy, whispering] Did you hear Stanley's having an affair?",I did. From you. You gotta stop telling people.
8173,Do you know if it's true? Do you have any idea? Because you might be ruining his life.,"[stares at Jim silently, then walks away]"
8174,"[in parking lot, blocking path of Stanley's car] Stop. Hold up, hold up, hold up! No, no, no. Time to stop being polite and get real. [Stanley honks horn repeatedly] Stanley, are you having an affair?","[as Michael gets in car] That is ridiculous. Of course not, why would you think that?"
8175,"[as Michael gets in car] That is ridiculous. Of course not, why would you think that?","So It's not true. Okay, well... ahhh, those interns, they told me they saw you at a club, and they all said it was you, it was clearly just... racial profiling gossip."
8176,"Wait, hold, hold, hold... so it IS true?","Yeah, but Michael, I'm going to go break it off. That's where I'm headed right now. I swear."
8177,"Oh my God! Wait a second, do people often say they're going on sales calls and then go someplace else? 'Cause that's not cool.","I just need you to promise not to say a word about this to anyone. Michael, please."
8178,Did you hear about Angela? That's pretty weird.,Yeah... what do you mean exactly?
8179,Yeah... what do you mean exactly?,"Well, the fact that she is apparently dating an 81-year-old billionaire. Owns a Quizno's on the turnpike."
8180,Uh huh. [gestures to Kevin to keep it quiet] Alright?,"How do you un-tell something? You can't. You can't put words back in your mouth. What you can do is spread false gossip so that people think that everything that's been said is untrue, including 'Stanley is having an affair.' It's like the end of Spartacus. I've seen that movie half a dozen times, and I still don't know who the real Spartacus is, and that is what makes that movie a classic whodunit."

8182,Kelly has an eating disorder?,Yeah.
8183,Really?,Yeah. So... and Andy is gay.
8184,Andy Bernard??,Mm hmm.
8185,[whispering to Meredith] Did you hear Pam is pregnant?,Really?
8186,Really?,Yeah!
8187,What?,[still giggling] Tea.
8188,So?,You would.
8189,Do you like it as much as you like mens' butts?,WHAT??
8190,WHAT??,Because you're gay.
8191,[serious] Who told you that? Was it Broccoli Rob? Someone from Chi Psi? Or did you run into someone from my high school?,"This is not the first time rumors about me being gay have come up. Twice before, actually. Just a weird coincidence... a little too weird. [chuckles nervously] Almost makes you wonder if it's not a coincidence at all. Whoa! Which it is, of course. [long pause] But it makes you wonder."
8192,[to Oscar in break room] Did you hear the rumor about me? That I'm gay?,[nodding] I did. Yes.
8193,And?,What?
8194,What?,Do you think it's true? Do you think that I'm... gay?
8195,Do you think it's true? Do you think that I'm... gay?,Are you attracted to other men?
8196,Are you attracted to other men?,"[scoffs and chuckles] No! But, let me kick you a scenario. I'm at a beach cabana, and Brad Pitt approaches. He tries to lean in and kiss me. I would definitely resist, like at first. But if he was persistent, [long pause] I think I might give in a little bit, just to see what it... felt like."
8197,"Would I push him away? How hard? Like, what if he's like really aggressive?","If you resisted Brad Pitt a little bit, he would still... need to get to you?"
8198,"If you resisted Brad Pitt a little bit, he would still... need to get to you?","It's not real Brad Pitt, this is like, this is my fantasy. Or it's like, not a fantasy, it's just... it's just a scenario."
8199,What exactly is my responsibility here? To comfort insecure heterosexual men? That can't possibly fall to me.,How far along is Pam?
8200,How far along is Pam?,"A few months, that's why they're rushing the wedding."
8201,"[whispering] Guys, guys... you can't believe everything you hear. Like Stanley, having an affair? That is crazy! It's just... there's no stalking it. It's a weird day for false facts. Let it go.","[with everyone assembled in conference room] Okay everybody, big day. Last day for our interns, a lot of other stuff... who knows what to believe? Dwight, the honors."
8202,"[with everyone assembled in conference room] Okay everybody, big day. Last day for our interns, a lot of other stuff... who knows what to believe? Dwight, the honors.","[giving envelopes to interns] Present these to the dean for credit. And, as a gift, I've attached my card. Call me any time of the day or night."
8203,Why would we call you at night?,"[grabs card from Eric, crumples it, throws it to the ground] Well now you can't call me at all. Problem solved."
8204,"[to Jim] Tuna, how come you never try to set me up?","Oh, I don't really do that. But Pam might have some friends, though."
8205,Women friends?,Yep.
8206,Not guy friends?,Are you... interested in her guy friends?
8207,Are you... interested in her guy friends?,"No. I mean, for the record, I prefer women."
8208,"Yeah, right?",Yeah!
8209,How?,You gotta have sex with a woman.
8210,On what?,[chuckles] Come on... little baby Tuna. Little junior toro.
8211,[to Pam] Did you know a baby conceived out of wedlock is still a bastard?,What?
8212,What?,Want me to say it again?
8213,Want me to say it again?,Why did that come into your brain?
8214,Why did that come into your brain?,[grabs Pam by the arm] Can I talk to you for a second?
8215,[grabs Pam by the arm] Can I talk to you for a second?,"[whispering to Pam in corner of room] So, they know."
8216,Who did you tell?,I didn't tell anyone! Who did you tell?
8217,I didn't tell anyone! Who did you tell?,Nobody!
8218,"[approaching Jim and Pam] Hey, did one of you tell Stanley I have asthma? Because I don't, and if it gets out, they won't let me scuba.","If I can't scuba, then what's this all been about? What am I working toward?"
8219,"If I can't scuba, then what's this all been about? What am I working toward?",[to Andy] What? You think I'm the voice of the Taco Bell dog?
8220,[to Andy] What? You think I'm the voice of the Taco Bell dog?,[to Phyllis and Stanley] What are you guys talking about? I have a daughter. How can I be a virgin?
8221,[to Phyllis and Stanley] What are you guys talking about? I have a daughter. How can I be a virgin?,"Hey, has everyone heard a crazy rumor about themselves today?"
8222,"Hey, has everyone heard a crazy rumor about themselves today?",[in unison] Yes.
8223,"[entering conference room] Yeah, yeah... you know what? Let's discredit these rumors.","Yeah, sure, but... who's been saying all that stuff?"
8224,"Yeah, sure, but... who's been saying all that stuff?","That's not important, Jim, I just think we shouldn't listen to any of that crap."
8225,"I need to do mine first. Who's been saying that there's another person inside of me, working me with controls?",I heard that from... Andy.
8226,[approaching Michael at elevators] Michael? [to others] He's over here!,[to Michael] Where are you going?
8227,[to Michael] Where are you going?,Nowhere.
8228,"Michael... [leads Michael to corner of vestibule, then whispers] You told people I use store-bought manure, when I showed you where my manure comes from. Hmm? Hmm? [Michael looks nervously to camera as elevator doors open]",Don't get on it. [Michael inches toward elevator]
8229,Even the fact that I'm gay?,Yes.
8230,"But guys, I'm a victim here too, okay? People here have been saying that I'm a J. Crew model.",No. We heard that about Jim.
8231,"Jim? No, no. I spread the rumor that somebody here was a J. Crew model, and I was referring to myself.",How is that a bad rumor?
8232,How is that a bad rumor?,"Because a lot of people think that models, even though they're very attractive, are somewhat vapid. It's set our industry back quite a bit."
8233,"Michael, why? Why say all these things? Why make up an eating disorder, Stanley's affair, me being a spokesdog...",[pissed off] You told everyone I was having an affair?
8234,[pissed off] You told everyone I was having an affair?,"Okay, okay... here's the thing. There was one true rumor out there today. I didn't want everybody to know what it was. So all of you are off the hook, except for this one person."
8235,"Well then, what's the one true rumor?",We have a right to know.
8236,Michael... am I gay?,"[sighs] The one true rumor, and this is going to ruin this person's life, is that..."
8237,Who's the father?,Jim.
8238,How far along?,Four months.
8239,Who's the OB/GYN?,Stop. Don't. Just...
8240,"Are we just gonna wait here? [Pam returns, displays sonogram]","[gasps, then cheers]"
8241,[to Jim and Pam] How long have you known about the pregnancy?,[look at each other uncertainly]
8242,A week? A month? A year?,"Michael, we only told our parents last week."
8243,Did you pee on a stick?,I did. It was inconclusive.
8244,[in disbelief] You called Stanley's wife?,"Oh, oh... yeah, a long time ago, just to make sure she was out of town. Oh... oh God."
8245,"[picking up phone] Hey, what up, Cynthia? [lowers phone, looking terrified]","[gets up to leave room, Michael gestures for him to stay]"
8246,[knock at Michael's Office door] Yeah?,You wanted to see me?
8247,You wanted to see me?,"Yes, Oscar come on in.  Close the door if you would.  Thank you, thanks so much for talking to me."
8248,Is everything okay?,"Yeah, it's routine.  I'm just a little bit scared."
8249,"I'm sure everything will be fine.  [pulls up a chair]  What do you? What's the procedure, if you don't mind my asking?",It is a colonoscopy.
8250,"In your experience, what should I be expecting in terms of sensation or emotions? [Oscar looks irritated and frustrated] Is there anything I can do to make it more pleasurable for me or for Dr. Shaundry?",[sighs] Oh my God.
8251,"My main concern, should I have a safe word?",Yeah.  [Oscar gets up and walks out]
8252,"So Michael, do you think you can give me a run down on the Buffalo clients by Monday?","Abso... you know what? I'll do you one better, Sunday, Sunday night."
8253,"Abso... you know what? I'll do you one better, Sunday, Sunday night.","Okay, I will look at it Monday."
8254,"Okay, Jim you wanna hit the conference room?",Sure.
8255,"Oh right, this thing. I remember now.  [whispers to Jim]  What's this about?","Ah, this is just me and David, if that's okay."
8256,Really?,Yeah.
8257,"Alright, do you mind if it sit this out?  I have so much work to do, I feel like I'm gonna blow my brains out.",[nods] Okay. [Jim smiles and waves to Pam]
8258,"Am I worried that Jim and David are having a meeting without me?  No, because we are the Three Amigos.  And once in awhile one of the Amigos will go off... to the bathroom... while the other two have a secret meeting.  [shrugs]",Hey let me escort you to your desk.
8259,"You and Jim are close, huh?","Yeah, I think the pregnancy really brought us together."
8260,"Hey, what do you think he and David are talking about? What do you...","Ummm, I don't know."
8261,"Did I?  Doesn't sound like me, not very superstitious.","If you are lying to me right now Pam, your baby is gonna come out a liar.  That's how it works.  They inherit things through the breast milk."
8262,I just don't want you to lie to me.  I don't want you to ever lie to me.  Have I ever lied to you?,Yeah.
8263,And that's how you broke your ankle?,Yes.
8264,"Hmmm, interesting.  How did the ladder end up on top of you, if you fell off of it?","This doesn't concern you man, you need to walk away."
8265,"Oh? From who, Dr. J?  Look, you really need to investigate this.  People don't just fall off of ladders.",A guy on my street fell off a ladder painting his house.  It was on the news.
8266,Since when have you known Darryl to rush to do anything other than to come up here for birthday cake?  [imitating Darryl]  Y'all having birthday cake?,That's not a very good Darryl.
8267,Please... and how many foremen do you know that pull boxes?,Hmmm.
8268,Who was that?,Sorry about that.  What'd I miss?
8269,Sorry about that.  What'd I miss?,"Michael, we would like to continue the rest of this meeting in private, please, if you don't mind."
8270,Think they're talking about me?,"No, I think they're talking about me."
8271,"What is Jim telling him?  That I can't handle this job?  That 's bull crap.  That is bull crap.  Although, it has been chaotic lately.  Corporate shut down the Buffalo branch which left us to absorb all of their clients.  I will tell you there has been work everyday.  Had to come in on a Saturday. To retrieve... I left my cell phone here.",Hey Kelly.
8272,Is Ryan going?,"I don't know, he hasn't RSVP'd yet."
8273,What can I do for ya Hoss?,[staring into the conference room] How are your sales doin'?
8274,[staring into the conference room] How are your sales doin'?,"How are my sales doin'?  Busted.  My numbers are down a little bit and it's 'cause of the economy.  You're not buying it, you're good.  Okay the truth is, I have been having trouble focusing lately.  I'm in this weird, flirty, nebulous thing with this cousin of mine and it's a total mind effer."
8275,"How are my sales doin'?  Busted.  My numbers are down a little bit and it's 'cause of the economy.  You're not buying it, you're good.  Okay the truth is, I have been having trouble focusing lately.  I'm in this weird, flirty, nebulous thing with this cousin of mine and it's a total mind effer.",Again with the cousin.
8276,"Shhh, I'm just trying to figure out what's going on in that room, okay?",Wallace had to show up on the one four month period that I'm completely overwhelmed.
8277,"You know when they say it's so crazy it just might work?  Well, I don't believe that.  I say go for the air-tight plan and that is why I am having Andy wheel me into the conference room inside a makeshift cheese cart.  It is just elegant.",[in the cheese cart] Be my eyes.
8278,What have we here?,"Oh, just backing up and turning around."
8279,Cheese platter?,"Oui, Oui, Monsieur.  From the Wisconsin region, a nice firm cheddar.  Also from the great state of Wisconsin, an aged parmesan.  Here you will find a cheddar style spread which has reacted nicely with the air to form a light rind which I think you'll  find both challenging and delicious.  At that point, I would recommend you take a trip south of the border to the great state of Illinois where you will find this fine Bleu Cheese dressing.  If I may be so bold, it's a lot of fun to let the goldfish take a little swim in the bleu cheese.  Bon appetit."
8280,"Erin, is Michael around?",I think he's around here...
8281,"[crawls out of the cheese cart unseen] Hey, hey, you must have walked right past me.  How you doin'?","Ah, yeah, could we talk in your office for a second?"
8282,"Ah, yeah, could we talk in your office for a second?","Yes, definitely."
8283,You're into trains?,I have been my whole life.
8284,You gonna eat all that dog food yourself?,Ooohhh... [crashes car into garbage cans]  Oh man!  You okay?
8285,Ooohhh... [crashes car into garbage cans]  Oh man!  You okay?,Just keep going.
8286,Can you just tell me now if you're coming or not?,"Yes, I'm coming to your wedding."
8287,Are you sure you're okay with these new responsibilites?,Look who you're talking to.
8288,What about Jim?  Do you think Jim is someone who is ready to move into a management position?,[looks at Jim]   Permission to speak on the record?
8289,[looks at Jim]   Permission to speak on the record?,Please do.
8290,"Jim is like Big Bird.  He is tall and yellow and very nice.  But would I put him in charge?  No, I don't think so.  Because Big Bird doesn't make the tough decisions.  I... If I was gonna put someone in charge, I would put Burt in charge or I would put one of the real grown-ups in charge, like Maria or Gordon, maybe.",I thought you liked Jim?
8291,I thought you liked Jim?,"Very much, Jim is my best friend. But it's his performance report... right here.  Now this was written by Toby, who we all know is extremely reliable."
8292,Is there anybody else you think could run the day to day of the branch?,I can just continue to run it myself.
8293,This was Jim's idea?,Mmhmm.
8294,[shakes jelly beans] Little pick me up?  [Jim accepts] Oh those are the best.  Little sugar rush.,"When you were in the office earlier talking to Wallace, did I come up at all?"
8295,"When you were in the office earlier talking to Wallace, did I come up at all?",Well we did talk about how handsome you are.
8296,Why don't we head in your office to talk?,"Oh what a week, God.  We said... I know there were certain things we said..."
8297,"Michael, did you say anything?","Tell you what, when you leave this office I am going to call Wallace and I am going to tell him that you should get that promotion."
8298,Really?,Yes!
8299,You will?  Wanna do it right now?,Yes.
8300,Toby! Dwight!  Is that them?,Definitely.
8301,Why would you think a lady is me?,Are you... are you serious?  Be... cause you look exactly alike.  Am I the only one?  Are you getting this?
8302,Are you... are you serious?  Be... cause you look exactly alike.  Am I the only one?  Are you getting this?,"No, nah.  I don't see it."
8303,"So, what, you're changing your mind about Jim?","Absolutely, [turns speakerphone off] not. [turns speakerphone back on]  Like I said before, Jim is fantastic and he deserves this job."
8304,What?,"He broke his ankle climbing over the railing and he lied about it because it was a misuse of company equipment, case closed."
8305,Really?  Then why is there new wood only on one railing?  Hmmm?   We should check the security tapes Toby.,"Well, I don't think there's any reason to check 'em but I suppose if we wanted to be really certain..."
8306,"So instead, you screwed me?",That's what she...
8307,Should I tell him you'll call him back?,"I, yeah... no, I'll tell him myself.  Let's both."
8308,"Hey Michael, you got Jim there with you?","No, it's just us."
8309,"Actually, can you call Jim in? I want him on, please.","Oh, oh, well here he is right now.  [Michael knocks on desk]  Come in.  [Makes sound effects for door opening and footsteps and points to Jim to answer]"
8310,"Alright, hey Michael can you pick up for one second.  [Michael picks up phone] Okay look, I'm not going to force you into anything.  If you're willing to lose Jim, fine, you just say so and we'll find another solution, okay.  Is that what you want to do?","Okay people,  listen up, I have an announcement to make, fraud was committed..."
8311,"Okay everybody, I have an announcement to make... whoa do you have an announcement?",I'm... I was making it.
8312,Co-manager of what?,"Of your butt, and your butt, and your butt, all of the Scranton branch butts."
8313,What's happening to you Michael?,"What's happening to me?  I am also being promoted to co-manager, we will be co-managers together.  Jim Halpert, welcome."
8314,"What's happening to me?  I am also being promoted to co-manager, we will be co-managers together.  Jim Halpert, welcome.",[shakes Michael's hand] Thank you. [Dwight looks disappointed and angry behind them]
8315,"Niagara Falls in October?  Pfft, hells yeah.",Do you think that you could send in your RSVP card?
8316,Do you think that you could send in your RSVP card?,"Nah, I'll just tell you now, easier."
8317,And you will eat whatever is fanciest?,Unless there's ribs. [leaves]
8318,"So rude, right?",Mmm hmmm.
8319,[in Michael's office] Could you please sign my expense report?,"No way, no how. Expense reports are a day-to-day item. That is Jim's now. I am exclusively big picture, epic."
8320,"Ah, ah, ah. Where's the 'please'? We're not animals.",Sign it.
8321,I'm sorry to hear about that. Who is this about?,You!
8322,Okay. Just want to let you know I take complaints very seriously. So... When did this happen?,One minute ago.
8323,Okay. And how do you feel?,Angry.
8324,All right. Did he hit you?,No.
8325,Did you cry?,No.
8326,Did you feel like crying?,No.
8327,Yes?,Can I talk to you in my office for a second?
8328,Can I talk to you in my office for a second?,"Mmm, sure, but could I first talk to you in my office?"
8329,"Mmm, sure, but could I first talk to you in my office?",Can I also be a boss?
8330,Can I also be a boss?,"Look, it doesn't take a genius to know that any organization thrives when it has two leaders. Go ahead, name a country that doesn't have two presidents. A boat that sets sail without two captains. Where would Catholicism be without the popes?"
8331,"Look, it doesn't take a genius to know that any organization thrives when it has two leaders. Go ahead, name a country that doesn't have two presidents. A boat that sets sail without two captains. Where would Catholicism be without the popes?",I have noticed that we--
8332,"N-- well, to be fair, Jim... James... Jimothy... To be fair, Jimothy, the-- ah, that sounds weird. Are you okay with being called Jim?",I am.
8333,"At first, we were talking about introducing a line of toilet paper. And what part of the human body does one use toilet paper upon? So you draw a line from there to the other planets, and I think by the end, we all learned a little bit about how small we are.","Yes, I agree."
8334,"You know what eats a large amount of the day are naps. You go to sleep, it's light out, you wake up, it's dark. That's the whole day. Where did that day go? I have no idea.",You mean on a weekend?
8335,You mean on a weekend?,Yes.
8336,How about this? I think our goal should be we don't have meetings unless they're absolutely essential.,Alright. No more meetings this week.
8337,Really? You just agreed to that?,I can be very suprising.
8338,What's going on?,"I need to fit into my wedding dress. However, I'm also pregnant."
8339,"Hey, did you guys register for wedding gifts?","We did, but mostly because people expect us to. We're also accepting other gifts not on the registry... However much."
8340,"It's awkward asking people for money, but we could really use it. Why doesn't Crate & Barrel let you register for a toaster full of cash?",Perfect. I hate registries.
8341,"My cousin makes the most amazing romantic birdhouse mailboxes. I know I shouldn't tell you, but you'll still be suprised when you see it. You're not registered for a birdhouse, are you?","No, we're not."
8342,Mm-hmm?,"[walks in, see's Oscar, Stanley, Creed and Kelly sitting in Michaels office] Okay, I thought I saw people missing."
8343,"Really? Hey, Stanley, what was the last thing Michael said before I came through the door?","Stanley, you don't need to answer that."
8344,Stanley?,"If you don't smell this, you're fired.'"
8345,What do you mean by 'these people'?,"Michael, this is a conference room meeting."
8346,What do you guys think? [all start talking at the same time],"Great. Guys, can I just have a moment alone with Michael?"
8347,"Great. Guys, can I just have a moment alone with Michael?","No, no, no, you don't need to go anywhere. Anything that Jim has to say to me, he can say in front of these types of people."
8348,Which is it more of?,Excuse me?
8349,Excuse me?,"David, I know that I'm very new at this, but I have a very good perspective on how things work."
8350,"Wait, I'm sorry. Michael, are you-- are you texting me?",I thought maybe we could talk after this is over.
8351,"Look, I need you both to take care of this. This is not going to be a problem, is it?","Nope, not at all."
8352,"Do you mean, like break-in in the middle of the night and change the numbers on payroll?","No, we can do it during the day. It doesn't have to be that dramatic, Jim."
8353,"Jim, don't take this the wrong way. Are you gonna take this the wrong way?",It's hard to tell so far.
8354,"I'm sorry, are you advocating that I use it less?",Sometimes the smartest people don't think at all.
8355,Like money? Like you-- you want my money?,Mm-hmm.
8356,Will you take a check?,Yeah.
8357,Is this what I've become? Materialistic? Shallow? I feel horrible. [looks down at the check] oh look! 'Mrs. Pam Halpert!' That's the first time I've seen it in writing!,"You know, the more I think about it, the more I think we should give it to the salesmen."
8358,"I know. I just think it seems smart to keep the salesmen happy right now. 'Course I know that this might come off as biased, so you know what? Let us...","Oh, my God! Are you gonna make another pro and con list? I'm gonna kill myself."
8359,"Oh, my God! Are you gonna make another pro and con list? I'm gonna kill myself.",I'm not gonna let you stop me from thinking.
8360,"Oh, I do?! Tell me what they are.",I think that you are able to take constructive criticism very well.
8361,"Okay. Well, why don't you tell me what those are, Jim? Why don't you enliven me?",I don't think you're good at making tough decisions!
8362,"Okay, here's a tough decision for you. You suck! You suck! Is that clear enough for you?!","But maybe I'm here for a reason, because I might have some good ideas, too. I've been sitting out there, and I've been learning a lot, and maybe I can just bring something different to the table."
8363,"Okay, Skippy, here we go. Why don't you run yourself out there and tell them? [laughs] You call it.",[leave the conference room to address everyone]
8364,"Could I have everyone's attention, please? I have some tough news, so I'm just gonna give it to you straight. Truth is, we only have so much money for raises this year, so the simple fact is some people will get raises, and some people won't. Now, what we've decided is, we are gonna give those raises to the sales staff.",Wait. Seriously?!
8365,Wait. Seriously?!,"Look, you guys are smart, so I'm just leveling with you. I'm just trying to treat you like adults."
8366,"But, I do not understand. If we're such smart adults, then why don't we get raises?","Excellent question, genius. It's because Jim wants to give the raises to his friends and the people he sleeps with."
8367,Well?,"Really what it is, is about the money the sales staff brings into the office."
8368,"[walks in from shopping, with bags in her hands] What's going on?",Jim is only giving raises to the salesmen.
8369,What the hell?! Why are you being such a jerk?!,"Hold on, Kelly. Would it help you to know that Jim thinks you're smart?"
8370,"Hold on, Kelly. Would it help you to know that Jim thinks you're smart?",No! [put's down her bags] How is that gonna repair Ryan's car?!
8371,No! [put's down her bags] How is that gonna repair Ryan's car?!,This is ridiculous! How could he do this to us?!
8372,This is ridiculous! How could he do this to us?!,"Okay, Dwight, you know what? You'd be getting the raise so--"
8373,"Okay, Dwight, you know what? You'd be getting the raise so--","What about all these people, huh?! How is it fair to them?!"
8374,"What about all these people, huh?! How is it fair to them?!",Exactly!
8375,My kid needs shoes! You want to tell him he doesn't get shoes?!,Yeah.
8376,What the hell?! [everyone complaining at Jim],"Wow! I'm just gonna rewind and back off a bit, so... [imitates a tape rewinding and chuckles, Michael comes over by Jim laughing]"
8377,"That was good! That was good! Okay, all right. Well, we all know it's hard to be a boss, right? You know what? Look around you. These are your best friends. These are the people who will open their hearts to you. They all have heart-ons for you [someone growns in disgust], and that is a gift. So in terms of gifts, we should be giving each other gifts. Angela, yes, lend Oscar a cup of sugar. This--",What are you talking about Michael?
8378,What are you talking about Michael?,We just need to hear your plan for our raise.
8379,"We would just like to know what's happening. Are we getting a raise, yes or no?","Alright! Let me get this clear! Does everybody want a raise? [all say yes] Alright, everyone wants a raise, so what we're going to do is go into here, and we will not come out until we do."
8380,"Alright! Let me get this clear! Does everybody want a raise? [all say yes] Alright, everyone wants a raise, so what we're going to do is go into here, and we will not come out until we do.","Again, that gives us no information."
8381,"This isn't a game, you know? It's our livelihood!",What about a raise based on merit?
8382,What about a raise based on merit?,Rank each person individually?
8383,Rank each person individually?,"Mm-hmm. Piece of cake. Ryan, obviously the best."
8384,Yeah. Who said that?,I think it was Creed.
8385,"[to camera, holds up a bean] Each Boston Baked Bean represents half a percent raise. We each got 24 beans, so the idea is, you place the bean on the picture [walking around the table] of who you think deserv-- who's that? [picture that Michael drew of toby, looks like a monster]",Toby.
8386,Alright! Who to pick? [walking around the table] Who to pick?,Here we go.
8387,What the hell?!,Things were not this bad when just Michael was manager.
8388,"Hey, what are you guys doing in here?",What does a bean mean?
8389,What does a bean mean?,"Why aren't there any beans on this very old, frizzy-haired picture of me?"
8390,"Why aren't there any beans on this very old, frizzy-haired picture of me?","Michael, what does a bean mean?"
8391,"Michael, what does a bean mean?",Jim?
8392,Jim?,I was just trying to be unbiased.
8393,What does a bean mean?!,Someone please explain it to Kevin.
8394,Why can't you? My time is just as valuable as yours.,Not according to the beans.
8395,This is how you make this important decision?,"There's no way that Stanley gets more beans than me. [starts to take Stanley's beans, Stanley swats Andy's hand with his crossword puzzle] That is ridiculous. This is how it works. [everyone continues to argue]"
8396,"Are we idiots? [gets up, starts walking around] What right does Jim have to claim authority, hmm? Is he as good a salesman as I? Is he as matronly as Phyllis? There are moments where we can affect change. For a few seconds every decade, we exist, and these are those seconds! Let us storm his castle! Come on! Tick-- let's get him. Tock-- let's get Jim! Tick-- and drag Jim out of his office! Tock-- take his keys away from him! Tick-- that's a clock! The time is getting very close! It's now or never! What say you?!",I say no.
8397,"No, I mean, what do you say to my plan? [all groan] Okay.","[leaving his office, hurrying to Jim's office]"
8398,What does a bean mean?,[in Jim's office] How you doing?
8399,[in Jim's office] How you doing?,"Uh, on a scale of one to ten, I'd say I'm about a four."
8400,"Oh, what are you usually?",Six. You?
8401,Six. You?,"Usually a ten, but I'm feeling like a zero."
8402,"I mean, a performance-based raise sounded like a good idea, right?","I know, I know."
8403,I just-- what?,"Um, nothing. I just... I used to have to do this part alone, and it was the worst. I have something I would like to give you. [leaves office]"
8404,[to camera] Michael's my only friend left in the office. Except Pam... I think. Is she still upset?,"[at Michael return to Jim's office] Michael, you cannot just keep avoiding us like this!"
8405,What's in here?,"Gin. [toast, sip]"
8406,Heard you guys are looking for cash for the wedding?,"Yeah, I mean, if it's all the same for you."
8407,"Question for you. Would you guys rather have $100 now, or $5,000 a year from now?",$100 now for sure.
8408,"Instead of $5,000 a year from now?",How sure is this?
8409,How sure is this?,The guy has an algorithm to determine the winner of any given college basketball game.
8410,"I'm sorry. You guys have probably noticed my stomach's a little more sensitive lately. So, if you wouldn't mind wearing a little less perfume... and if your lunch is especially pungent, maybe have it in the break room?",We would really appreciate it.
8411,"Phyllis, if you could switch to a different soap, just for a month or two? Yours is kind of perfumy.",Now this is getting ridiculous.
8412,[standing next to a car decorated for leaving a wedding] What do you think? I spent all morning on it.,It is really special.
8413,"So... you're going to provide them, then?",No. This is a fire cracker free wedding.
8414,What the hell?,Come on. You've got to be kidding me.
8415,Is that all you have on her?,"Well, if this is in fact her because it is a very common name."
8416,"People don't think of me as one of the sharper dressers in the office... but I'm going ot turn that around at this wedding. I thought, how could I take it to the next level? The hair. [Angela beeps her car horn.] It's the hair-- [beeps again.] Ok. Ok. I'm going. [long beep] God.","[in Andy's car, Andy driving] Hey, do one of you guys want to sit up front with me so I have someone to talk to?  It's like a five hour drive-ish, you know."
8417,"[in Andy's car, Andy driving] Hey, do one of you guys want to sit up front with me so I have someone to talk to?  It's like a five hour drive-ish, you know.",This is so much cooler. We feel like wer're in a limo and you're our driver.
8418,Mmm-hmm. Erin?,Oh no. That wouldn't be fair to leave Kelly alone in back.
8419,Yeah?,She said everything with the wedding goes by so fast we should try to take mental pictures of the high points.
8420,What? No way!,Those glasses are super dark.
8421,You know what? I made you a cd...,You did?
8422,You did?,Mmm-hmm.
8423,"You're gonna like this. [Dwight's voice on the cd] 'Hello. This is Dwight Schrute. If you are listening to this you are a lucky woman Michael has seduced. Ah to be in your shoes. 'What's next?', you're probably wondering. Don't be scared of you're night in heaven--' [Michael turns off cd]",Are you serious? You want me to play that for a woman coming to my room?
8424,Are you serious? You want me to play that for a woman coming to my room?,Yeah. It's practical.
8425,Can we take a look at the suite now?,"Oh, I'm sorry. Somebody just checked in."
8426,Oh... is there another wedding at the hotel this weekend?,"Oh, no. Just an individual. That man over there."
8427,"I'm sorry, sir, but I'm not seeing you in here. When did you make your reservation?",I don't have a reservation but I want a room in the Halpert-Beesly block of rooms.
8428,And I had spoken to Teresa about a room with two safes?,Sure. No problem.
8429,No way. What if I meet someone?,"I'm staying in your--  Come on, Dwight."
8430,You would?,Yes.
8431,Really?,Yes... just go--
8432,"Oh no. Now that I don't have a room, can I stay with you?",Um... no. And you know what? I would say yes but you can't. And I'll tell you why.
8433,Um... no. And you know what? I would say yes but you can't. And I'll tell you why.,Please?
8434,Please?,"If I have a woman up there and things are getting amorous, she's going to get turned off if she looks in he bathroom and sees you brushing your teeth with butter and clay."
8435,I don't have a room?,No you do not.
8436,Hey. Stanley? Can I stay in your room tonight?,Are you crazy? I brought Cynthia with me.
8437,Are you crazy? I brought Cynthia with me.,Not in the same bed. In the other bed.
8438,"I'm not a physics major, Stanley. I'm just saying be careful. Hey, guys. Hey. Could I stay in your room tonight?",Oh. Gross.
8439,"So, which one is Pam's grandma?","Oh, Mema? She's the one in the teal suit. She's the only 80 year old with no smile wrinkles."
8440,"Oh, Mema? She's the one in the teal suit. She's the only 80 year old with no smile wrinkles.","Dad, remember, no mention of the baby, right?"
8441,"Dad, remember, no mention of the baby, right?",No.
8442,How ya doin'?,Hi.
8443,Who's doing a toast? I would like to go third. Sort of bat clean up and--,"Michael, I thought we discussed that we would rather you not speak, like, at all. Because it's just going to be blood relatives, I think."
8444,Mr. Beesly. How are ya?,I'd like you to meet Christy Kelly.
8445,"Oh. Is this, uh, is this your niece?",[laughs] No no. She's my girlfriend. Hey? Can you make room at the head table?
8446,[laughs] No no. She's my girlfriend. Hey? Can you make room at the head table?,"From quarter three to quarter four up 17 percent, while his sales down two percent. It's all in the report."
8447,Why would they make the bad man a boss if you're so much smarter?,"Excellent question. Because while I was busy trying to improve the company and make it a success, Jim... the bad man was busy kissing the boss man's butt."
8448,"I'm sorry, it's Kevin. I thought it was Gil?",She thought I was your boyfriend.
8449,You thought I was dating this? What the hell is wrong with you?,"Oscar, it was an honest mistake."
8450,Him? Him?,"Oscar, I would be proud to date you."

8460,That's a car that can talk. Can Smart Car talk? Nope.,No.
8461,"Aw, thanks, Pete. That was really nice. I just want to say how happy we are that all of you are here tonight. And I want to especially thank those of you who traveled from far away to be here with us tonight... especially the Flordia cousins who, obviously, can't take a hint. [laughter] Four years ago, I was just a guy who had a crush on a girl who had a boyfriend. And I had to do the hardest thing that I've ever had to do... which was just to wait. Uh, don't get me wrong. I flirted with her. Pam, I can now admit in front of my friends and family that I do know how to make a photo copy. Didn't need your help that many times. And do you remember how long it took you to teach me how to drive a stick?",Like... a year.
8462,What's obvious? Why can't Pam drink?,"Pam can't drink? I didn't-- I shouldn't have said that. I don't know why I did. She can do whatever she wants, though she shouldn't. She shouldn't because she's an alcoholic. Pam is an alcoholic. That's not true. I-- no. What we want-- the real reason is that, that Pam's pregnant."

8465,They were living together?,"Yes. Yes they were living together. Yes and you know what? You can't expect them to be careful every time. Because, frankly, it's just a different sensation."

8474,"Oh. Isn't he terrible? May I? Here's the thing. Umm... Mema, I think you just need to chill out about this whole Pam getting pregnant thing. It's not 1890 anymore. It's modern day. And women have sex before marriage and I think we need to celebrate that. And I know in your day she would be considered a whore but, now, women go out and they have sex and they get wild and they take their tops off and they have pictures taken of them and we need to encouage them. That's part of life.",People are like cats and dogs these days.

8648,What else?,That's it.
8649,Do we have a conversation scheduled?,"Number one, do not leave your things on my desk. It's not some kind of personal pen receptacle for you.

8676,Is this because of the 60 Minutes segment about working conditions in our Peruvian paper mill?,"That was a hit job.  If you read the Dunder Mifflin press release it clearly states that they had absolutely nothing to do with that particular cancer cluster.  So if there is a lesson to be learned here and I'm not sure that there is, it is that in order to help our communities, we need to put other people's needs ahead of our own."
8677,"Who wants to help the world one step at a time?  [Dwight raises his hand] Alright, good.",Volunteerism is important.  Every weekend I volunteer at the local animal shelter and they need a lot of help down there.  Last Sunday I had to put down over 150 pets all by myself.

Is it really so horrible that I could possibly go out and find happiness.","Good luck Michael, I hope you find what you're looking for."
8685,"[in a sing-songy voice] Pam, how's your day going?","Pam, just for the record, I think you're overreacting a little bit, your mom's old enough to make her own decisions."
8686,"Oh, well, thanks Oscar.  I was just wondering how would you feel if Michael was sleeping with your mom?",My mother's in a wheelchair.
8687,"[Dwight listening in his ear piece] Ryan, I have to ask you a personal question.   Do you think that I should get a Fedora?","Ahh, I don't think so, no..."

8695,"[walks up to Pam's desk with a binder] Hey Pam, could I talk to you for a sec?","Sure, what's up?"
8696,"Sure, what's up?","Well, I was hoping that maybe in light of everything that's happened today, it would be a good idea if today, you, me, and Michael could head into the conference room for some conflict resolution."
8697,"[to Michael] What's the matter, you can't fight your own battles?",No... that's...
8698,"[to Michael] Oh, would that make you feel better?",I don't... um... I can't hear your conversation.
8699,"Yeah, yeah, yeah-okay... you're a jackass.  [to Pam]  Hey, hey, you know what?  You're just as stubborn as your mother, when you don't wanna do something you just don't do it.","Heh, heh, heh."
8700,[to Jim] What!  You knew?,"Barely, I... I don't have all the facts.  Frank and Bean..."
8701,"[Pam storms into break room] Okay, do you want me to stop seeing your mom?  Is that how we're gonna get past this?  Cause, I will.","Mmmmm, yes!"
8702,Then why'd you even offer!?,Because I assumed that you want me to be happy because I want you to be happy.

9225,"Guys, um, who's Gabe? This note says to put the box aside for Gabe Lewis, who's coming tomorrow?","Okay, everybody, listen up. I have some bad news. Due to circumstances beyond my control -"
9226,Right? Mm. Did we try printer first? Shredder at an angle -,Yep.
9227,"Fax, cable, then the scanner upside down?",Yes.
9228,Have you tried making everything smaller?,"And - [Jim seals box with tape, rips covered with stickers] Wow. Really nice job. This group of people, when they put their minds together, they can do something great. And I think that you should all be proud of yourselves. [cell phone starts ringing from inside box]"
9229,"Alright, he's on his way up. Okay. Are we ready?",What do you want us to do?
9230,What do you want us to do?,Why do I have to explain everything?
9231,Why do I have to explain everything?,Because we're usually not on the same page.
9232,Welcome. Scranton hot dog from Scranton?,"You know what, Dwight? Let's give him a minute to settle in, shall we? Ok?"
9233,"You know what, Dwight? Let's give him a minute to settle in, shall we? Ok?","Um, hi, uh, my name is Gabe Lewis. I am coordinating director for merging regions."
9234,"We're very excited too, aren't we guys? Right?",So excited.
9235,You sure it's saber?,Hey.
9236,"So you've just been bought by Sabre. You've probably got a lot of questions. Hi. I'm Christian Slater. What's it like to work for Sabre? Let's find out together. Working at Sabre means taking on the challenge of the road that rises to meet you. Sabre is respecting the past, but opening a window to the future. Have you ever tasted a rainbow? At Sabre, you will.",You'll find it easy to embrace the Sabre spirit. Welcome. We're very excited to go on this journey with you.
9237,"[Christian Slater impression] So you've been shown a nonsensical video. You're probably wondering, 'What's going on?' Well, you're not alone.",Wow. Really terrific.
9238,"Hey, who the hell's going through our stuff?","Actually, that's Nick. He's your new IT guy. Uh, he's setting up a site blocker. Mostly blocking the inappropriate sites.  And then there are the time-wasting sites like Twitter, YouTube. We are blocking those as well."
9239,"Ok, did everyone get one? With these bottles, we eliminate the need for plastic water bottles, which are the scourge of the environment.","We'll still get to use the little cups, though, right?"
9240,"We'll still get to use the little cups, though, right?",Little cups? Like paper or plastic or... ?
9241,Little cups? Like paper or plastic or... ?,I don't know what they're made of.
9242,[in line to fill up water bottle behind Kevin and Toby] Really? You don't have enough water in there? Your stomach?,Oop.
9243,What?,Looks like we kicked it. [indicates water jug is empty]
9244,Which ones?,All of them.
9245,"Well, I wish that I could do something, but it's kind of policy, you know? Above my pay grade. You know?",So maybe we should call. We should call someone. I could help. I'm good with bosses. Call one of the higher-ups?
9246,So maybe we should call. We should call someone. I could help. I'm good with bosses. Call one of the higher-ups?,You know what? Let me see what I can do.
9247,You know what? Let me see what I can do.,"[after entering daycare] Ok, this is officially the cutest thing I've ever seen. Cubbies. I totally forgot about cubbies."
9248,There's a finger-painting station and a curly slide. Am I too old to go here?,"Oh. Adorable, right? [opens kiddie bathroom, sees man on toilet] I walked in on someone in the bathroom."
9249,"Oh. Adorable, right? [opens kiddie bathroom, sees man on toilet] I walked in on someone in the bathroom.",What?
9250,What?,I just walked in on someone in the bathroom.
9251,Who? The -,I don't know. I don't know.
9252,The guy we're meeting with?,"I don't know, I don't know."
9253,"Wait a minute, who is it? Who's there? Is there somebody in the room with you? [Michael gesturing 'no'] I want to see who it is. Turn me around.",I don't - it's just...
9254,"Turn me around. Now. [Michael starts to leave, Jo whistles] Hey, Buddy. Is it something I said?",Hello. No. My name's Michael Scott. Hello.
9255,"Aw, thank you. I've been working on it since I was a little girl. To, um, to what do I owe the pleasure of this videochat?","Well, I am little concerned with all of these changes, to be quite frank. I think we have done things a certain way here at Dunder Mifflin for quite some time, and -"
9256,Ok. I feel very strongly that you can't just come in here and change everything that people have been doing forever. Is Christian Slater back there? Because... he knows. He'd know what to do.,"So listen, why don't you tell Gabe if by the end of the day you can't handle the changes."
9257,"Pam and Jim? Hey, I'm Jerry.",Hi Jerry.
9258,"Oh, so you saw it already?","No, no, no, no. Yes. We saw this, yes. No, it wasn't like a look around. We really just had a peek. Quick peek. Didn't focus on anything in particular."
9259,What if we just bring it up? We just put it out in the open?,That's the weirdest possible solution to the problem.
9260,"I have come here today to talk to Mr. David Wallace about this whole thing going on with Sabre. [rings doorbell] He will know exactly what to do. He is not a big fan of me dropping by announced. But then again, who is? [loud drumming as door opens] Hey. Hi, sorry.",Michael.
9261,"No, you kidding? Come on in. Come on.",You sure?
9262,You sure?,You look great.
9263,You hungry? I'm just having lunch.,"Oh, yeah, that sounds good."
9264,Huh? Hey. [continues drumming],Hey. Wow.
9265,Can I just stay here and never go back?,Things not going so well there?
9266,Things not going so well there?,"Oh, man. How much time do you have?"
9267,"Oh, man. How much time do you have?",I have a doctor's appointment next Thursday.
9268,"Hey, honey. How's your day going? Did you do anything cool?","Uh, no, sweetie. I just sort of hung out."
9269,No problem at all. This is great. So what are you guys up to?,I don't know.
9270,"That seems a bit premature, don't you think? I don't even know if I have a space for you yet, and you're already lining up your holiday plans.","Oh, no, sorry. Just, um, we're kind of planners. But we're also flexible too, so you know what? Maybe we can just discuss it when the time comes."
9271,"Oh, no, sorry. Just, um, we're kind of planners. But we're also flexible too, so you know what? Maybe we can just discuss it when the time comes.","Yeah, if the time comes, we can discuss it."
9272,Is this because Jim walked in on you going to the bathroom?,What?
9273,What?,Seriously? You told her?
9274,Seriously? You told her?,Did it? It might have come up while we were waiting for you.
9275,Did it? It might have come up while we were waiting for you.,And you - you thought that might have something to do with how the meeting is going?
9276,And you - you thought that might have something to do with how the meeting is going?,No.
9277,"Well, you didn't consider the fact that it might not be going super well just because it might not be going super well?",Nope. 'Cause we're really nice people but you don't seem to like us.
9278,I'm being perfectly pleasant. Did you ever consider that you might not be as charming as you think you are?,"Oh, this coming from the guy who still uses a children's toilet? Why didn't you just lock the door, man?"
9279,"Oh, this coming from the guy who still uses a children's toilet? Why didn't you just lock the door, man?",It doesn't lock for the children's safety.
9280,"Sabre is changing everything. [Michael and David sitting in hot tub] Site blockers. They don't let us use cups. So I started thinking, who could handle this? Who would know what to do? David Wallace would know what to do. What should I do, David Wallace?","I don't know. I mean, what can you do?"
9281,"I don't know. I mean, what can you do?",Exactly. What are you thinking?
9282,Exactly. What are you thinking?,"I, I - It's a tough one."
9283,"Ok? You know how kids leave their toys everywhere? Okay. So this is a vacuum. It's like a shop-vac type of thing. [imitates vacuum] Teaches kids how to pick up their own toys. Right? Baseball gloves, hacky sacks, drumsticks. [sucking noise] Picks it up!",So the kid's making the noise to pick it up.
9284,"No, it's ok. Another guy from Dunder Mifflin, Arnie from Research, he's gonna draw up the prototype. And, uh... It's like shop-vac. [sucking noise] Did I say that?",Yep.
9285,"Hey, any fun weekend plans?","No, you?"
9286,"No, you?","Uh, no, actually. So nothing? No movies, or parties, or anything you might want to invite someone to?"
9287,"Uh, no, actually. So nothing? No movies, or parties, or anything you might want to invite someone to?",Nothing. It's wide open.
9288,The what?,Suck it. That's what it's called.
9289,Huh? Catchy. Kids'll love it.,Like it.
9290,"Hello. [comes in carrying 4 gallons of orange juice and his water bottle] Is anybody home? Oh, thank you, Erin. Now if everyone would please ready their canteens, so I can fill them with the sweet, sweet nectar of Gabe's homeland, and then propose a toast. Here we go.",You know when people say getting fired was the best thing that ever happened to them? I feel sorry for those people. That's the best thing? Really? Ugh.
9291,You know when people say getting fired was the best thing that ever happened to them? I feel sorry for those people. That's the best thing? Really? Ugh.,"Well, I'm not really one for making speeches."
9292,That's your toast?,No. This is my toast.  I think this whole thing with Sabre is going to work out. I have a very good feeling about it.
9293,"Mm. Wow. That is metallicy. Ugh. That's like drinking a battery. Ah, really gets you in the fillings, doesn't it? Okay, anyway, welcome.","[singing] Well, it's a mess, what a mess. What you gonna do? You're going to take out your Suck It and you suck it. Suck it. Yeah, take out your Suck It and you suck it."
9294,"[singing] Well, it's a mess, what a mess. What you gonna do? You're going to take out your Suck It and you suck it. Suck it. Yeah, take out your Suck It and you suck it.",Suck it!
9295,"[on phone] Vancouver Court Hotel, how many I help you?","Hello Vancouver, this is Michael Scott calling from the United States of America!  I have a reservation in your fair city from February 12th to the 19th, first week of the Olympics."
9296,What?,[looking through Michael's email] I'm not seeing anything under 'confirmation.'
9297,Could it be under 'affirmation?' Cause you have thousands of those.,No. [to hotel employee on phone] We're trying to look it up right now.
9298,"Uh, sir? A lot of people are trying to get last-minute reservations at hotels here for the Olympics, but we've been fully booked for months.","Well, I have been booked for three years, so you should have that. I've always heard that British Columbia is a very nice place, but I am not getting that from this conversation."
9299,Uh-huh. Seven nights in our street-view economy single?,That's it!
9300,"Yeah, how may I help you Mr. Scott?","Alright, I would like to cancel my reservation, please."
9301,"Today, Jo Bennett, the CEO from Sabre, is coming to see us here for the first time. She bought us sight unseen, like a mail-order bride, so she's gotta be kinda nervous. I mean, are we ugly? Are we smart? Are we cool? Are we too cool? Do we speak English?","[Jo Bennett enters with two humongous dogs, everyone stands to welcome her except Dwight] Why hello!"
9302,Do you always stay seated when a lady enters the room?,"I am treating you the same as a man, for whom I would also not stand. Unless it was the President. Or Judge Judy."
9303,Another couple of heartbreakers. Who is this tall drink of sun tea?,"That is Jim Halpert, he is the co-regional manager of this office."
9304,[gesturing to Michael] I thought this guy was the manager?,"Oh, he is. He's the co-manager, and that's the other co-manager."
9305,Two guys doing one job? We gotta do something about that!,Got some Valentine's cards for my coworkers and my bro-workers.
9306,"What, no candy?","Valentine's Day, right around the corner. Erin and I have been on zero dates. So I got her a Valentine's Day card, but I didn't wanna seem 'too eager,' so I got cards for everyone in the whole office to kind of dilute it a little bit."
9307,"This is knucklehead talk. I'm not gonna bite it, you know. You can't give me gravy and tell me it's jelly, because gravy ain't sweet! Is it, Jim?",I don't think so.
9308,Michael?,Forget the question...
9309,I... Why would you just say something like that?,"Because, well, Jim. Where I'm from, two types of folk: those who ain't, and those who are knee-high on a grasshopper. Which type ain't you ain't? Ya'll come back now."
9310,"Because, well, Jim. Where I'm from, two types of folk: those who ain't, and those who are knee-high on a grasshopper. Which type ain't you ain't? Ya'll come back now.",Do you even know what that means?
9311,Do you even know what that means?,Yes.
9312,"[opening card] Oh, you did? Aw, a bird and a dog!","Yeah, well it's Snoopy and Woodstock."
9313,You named them?,"Uh, Charles Schultz did. I thought it was relevant cause I got you all those birds for Christmas, remember?"
9314,"Uh, Charles Schultz did. I thought it was relevant cause I got you all those birds for Christmas, remember?","Uh, yeah I do remember. [reading card] Aw, they love each other."
9315,"That's right, darlin', now you're the proud new owner of a Sabre handbook and my autobiography. Now, you all must be in a tizzy. I can see it on your faces, I mean, what's going on now? I mean, who owns Dunder Mifflin? Right? I mean, Sabre? What's that? Some company I've never heard of? Down in Tallahassee? Where is that? Near Mars?","No, we know. Texas!"
9316,"I don't think I'm gonna miss being manager. You know how some people say they're not in it for the money? Well, with all due respect to this job, I think I'm definitely in it for the money. And quite honestly, the women.","Hey, you got a second?"
9317,"Hey, you got a second?",Sure. You here to tell me that you think I would be a better manager and that you are sorry for being such a jerk?
9318,Sure. You here to tell me that you think I would be a better manager and that you are sorry for being such a jerk?,"Actually, yeah."
9319,What?,Exactly that. I think that you absolutely deserve the manager position more than I do.
9320,What? Really?,Yeah!
9321,What are you reading?,The Atlantic.
9322,"Why, is there an untapped gay market?",Sabre has no caps on commissions. He can make a lot more money in sales.
9323,Manuel who?,"Well, according to the manual, there is no cap on commissions. I have been hustled."
9324,"Really? Aw, that is so sweet of you! But, I cannot accept, because I have been thinking about it, and I think I wanna go back to sales.",Really?
9325,Really?,Really.
9326,Why would you do that?,I'm turning myself in right now!
9327,Did you see Saw?,Of course I seesaw. Mose and I seesaw all the time.
9328,"No, uh, the movie. Did you see the movie Saw?","Oh, yeah. Great film. Almost as fun as going on a seesaw."
9329,Could we lure him into an old warehouse or something?,I have an old barn!
9330,"It's kinda smelly, but that might be a plus! And then what?","We do what they did in Saw! ... I mean, we don't kill him, obviously. I have a mask..."
9331,"Okay, that's your idea? Exactly like in the movie!? That is the most idiotic thing I have ever heard in my life!",Well suggest something else then! Don't just...
9332,He's supposed to cut his leg off? Think!,Don't just criticize my idea!
9333,How is that possible?,"Well, in your old office there were all those ledges and extra space."
9334,"Oh, yeah. Fine, fine. Leave it here. I have to make some sales anyway. Who should I call with my magic sales fingers? [Michael's phone rings] Michael Scott, head of sales.","[on phone] You gotta do something, man. You can't just sit there."
9335,"Why don't you just let me handle the Tolkien references, okay dumb jock?","Well, I think he can be corrupted. Like Gollum."
9336,Who's hungry?,What is that?
9337,What is that?,It's ants on a log. Michael would always have me bring them in at 2:30 and say 'Who's hungry?'
9338,It's ants on a log. Michael would always have me bring them in at 2:30 and say 'Who's hungry?',"Oh. I'm fine. Thank you, though."
9339,Do you want me to spin you in your chair and make you dizzy?,Why would I wanna do that?
9340,Why would I wanna do that?,"It's a thinking technique. All the top executives do it. It keeps the brain moving, and a spinning brain is a working brain."
9341,Why not? It's part of the sales experience.,It's not really 1992 anymore.
9342,"I know, obsessed with me much?","Well, everyone got one."
9343,What did yours say?,Friends are worth sharing a doghouse with.
9344,"It's no wonder that Andy gave Kelly such a romantic card. I can't compete with her. That girl can sing, and dance, and gets all of her clothes at the mall. And I feel like such a fool for thinking that Andy was only going after one girl, cause Andy Bernard is a playboy. And, why shouldn't he be? He's got it all.","Ho-ho. There he is, the IT guy. So you discovered the break room."
9345,"Listen, I know you have to say that, but we got a little problem here. There is an employee named Jim Halpert, and he is doing some terrible things, okay? He is molesting people via the internet. And we need to stop him.",I think that you should call the cops.
9346,Are you... you threatening me?,"Threatening you? No. [tries to crush an aluminum can, Dwight  crushes an apple]"
9347,"Threatening you? No. [tries to crush an aluminum can, Dwight  crushes an apple]",What is that smell? Do you smell that? What is that? Like a sulfur deposit under here?
9348,What is that smell? Do you smell that? What is that? Like a sulfur deposit under here?,"Michael, stop."
9349,"No, I'm serious, we don't have to put up... Is it the dogs?",Michael...
9350,Are you kidding me?,No.
9351,And you guys are okay with this?,"She sent an email, so."
9352,"Believe me, if I got that card? We'd be in the bathroom doin' it right... now.",Hey.
9353,"For the record, I fought this. Alright? And now, I'm not really sure what we do.","We make a poster that says 'Happy Opposite Day!' and she sees it on the way out... Nah, that's stupid. Ugh! I wish we had one of those amnesia flashlights from Men in Black."
9354,Lethal Weapon?,That's it. I think we should do it the Lethal Weapon way.
9355,"You two are grown-ass men. What do I have to do, fire you and get two people in here who don't need so much management?",What? What I'm saying...
9356,What? What I'm saying...,"Michael's saying he's better at being manager, and I agree, cause he's a better people person, weirdly."
9357,"And weirdly I'm a good dog person, right guys? [dogs go to him] See? They love me.","Fine. I don't care which one of you does which job, just stop meeting with me to talk about it."
9358,"[Erin leaves room] Excuse me? Everyone? Please check your emails, I just sent you the following message: 'Coworkers, you may have received a Valentine from me. Please understand this does not mean that I like you in any way.'",You don't even like us as friends?
9359,You don't even like us as friends?,"Phyllis, you guys are like my closest friends. I just mean I don't like-like you."
9360,"What are we, five?","Please don't read into this card. Yours in professionalism, Nard dog.'"
9361,"[entering with Erin] Um, why did I just receive a mass email from you that said that you don't like me? Do you realize how hard that makes me like you, Andy?",It's n-- that wasn't... I like someone else.
9362,Who?,"It's not... Whether or not, you..."
9363,"Who, what?","Yeah, I guess Andy never liked Kelly. How about that?"
9364,"Yeah, I guess Andy never liked Kelly. How about that?","Oh, it smells good in here."
9365,"Erin, what about my keyboard? [Erin hits a button on an electronic keyboard, playing a beat] Aw, so good to be home. How about a little Bosa Nova?","Oh! [hits another key, they awkwardly dance together]"
9366,"Well, well, well. Hm. Boss for, what was it? Oh, four and a half hours? New record. Low. Previous record? Henry Rosston. Boss for nine years, four months. And he only left because he had family matters to attend to and he [Jim dunks Dwight's tie in his coffee cup, Pam smiles] what? Michael!",[entering elevator with Ryan] I can't help but think that something we did made this possible.
9367,"Oh temp, I like that. I'm going to engrave that into a piece of wood. Care to celebrate with a drink?","I would love to. [elevator doors close, then reopen in the lobby] Why not?"
9368,"I would love to. [elevator doors close, then reopen in the lobby] Why not?",Because! Martini bars are pretentious. No thank you.
9369,"[on the phone] Hey, did I tell you we were going to have a baby?  Oh, thank you very much.  I'm excited.  Oh, definitely.","No, no!  You need to come by your sales honorably!"
9370,"[on the phone with a client]  Hey there.  Dwight Schrute here.  Listen, uh, would you be interested in restocking on paper? ...  Yeah, I could sure use the money.  My cousin, uh, came down with a case of that nasty new goat fungus.  Oh, it's just horrific.  The  doctor says he'd never seen it beard so quickly.  Okay.","I need a baby.  I'll never outsell Jim and Pam without one.  Also, I've been noticing a gaping hole in my life.  Sometimes I wake up cradling a gourd."
9371,"Mmmm, that sounds great.  What are you thinking?",I think it should be a surprise.
9372,"[After Pam has a contraction]  Oh, getting there, huh?","No, no.  I still have time."
9373,"Oh, oh, oh!  Contraption!  She's contrapting!  Okay, you know what?  I think I should drive you guys to the hospital, and here is why.  I am a licensed, classy driver in the state of Pennsylvania.  I gassed up the car...",Michael.
9374,"You know the baby's not going to live here, right?","Well, the baby was conceived here, so might as well live here a little bit, too."
9375,"Oh, yuck!  TMI!  How was it?  I don't want to know.  Tell me later.  Let's go!  Let's go!  Hospital!","Okay, okay, we're not going to the hospital.  We are waiting until midnight."
9376,"Ooh, spooky.  But why?",Because the insurance company only covers two nights.
9377,[as Nick looks over at her]  What are you looking at?,"Ha, nerd."
9378,"Did you know that labor can last weeks?  Then they take your insides out and they just plop them on a table, and sometimes epidurals don't work, and you can poop yourself.",[with Angela in the break room]  Bare my child.
9379,Excuse me?,"I want to have a child for business reasons and I want you to be the mother.  If you agree, say nothing.  If you disagree, say anything...  Very well.  Let's meet at 4:00 PM at our old meeting spot and bang it out."
9380,Are you serious?  Pam.,"No, the doctor said every five to seven minutes."
9381,Did you hear that?  Butt-mud Brooks.,"Okay, but we are leaving at five minutes apart."
9382,"Well not until Friday 20% off toner cartridges, that's a big deal.  While we're on the subject, why don't I just run you down to the hospital and we'll just do a quick check?",Not until midnight.
9383,"No, no, no, no, no.  You know what?  You can't tell us what to do because you are not co-manager anymore.","[as Andy and Kevin shout 'yeah!' in response to Michael] Okay, I feel like this noise is going to prevent Pam from being able to listen to her body's signals."
9384,"Um, I am sort of a master of distraction.  When I was a kid, my mom received compliments left and right from my teachers on how I was always able to distract others in class.  Try to think, what were the first thirteen colonies?  Mm-hmm, mm-hmm.  [Michael covers his mouth and makes fart noises.]",The purpose for this meeting is to take Pam's mind off of what's going on inside of her body.
9385,Can we do sleight of hand tricks?,I will allow that.
9386,Yes!  Can anyone do those?,I'm going to go look at the Internet.
9387,"Does anybody have anything?  Anything interesting, any hobbies, uh, special skills?","Yes, this is the only time I'm ever going to make this request."
9388,"Yes, Phyl?",I can put on lipstick the way Molly Ringwald does in The Breakfast Club.
9389,"[as Pam gives the thumbs up]  That sounds good!  Do you need some music, or...?  Okay.","Nope, actually music would just throw me off.  I need complete silence.  Okay...  [Pam begins to clap as Andy dances]  You're clapping.  I need complete silence.  Totally threw me off, so I'm going to have to start over.  Evolution of dance-dance."
9390,What is this?,"Before we conceive a child, uh, it is important that we bang out a parenting contract."
9391,"Now, then.  Let's get to it, shall we?  Item one:  [speaking into a voice recorder] Child will be breast fed by the mother for exactly six months, then weaned onto a nutrient-rich winter vegetable mash provided by the father, Dwight Schrute, hereafter referred to as Morpheus.  Agreed?",Agreed.
9392,"[as Pam has another contraction]  Where are we?  We have every six minutes, ladies and gentlemen.  Another seventy five contractions and you are going to be there.","For the love of God, Pam, do it for ultra feast!"
9393,"Okay, you know what?  I'm going to go give, uh, doctor Asmani a quick call.  He'd probably know...","Jim, please.  Happy thoughts here.  Happy times."
9394,"Okay, yeah, why don't you go get it?","Okay, uh, the second one is walk around.  We're already doing the opposite of that.  Perfect.  Okay, number three, eat spicy foods."
9395,"Okay, the opposite of that?",Stick spicy food up her butt.
9396,Why don't you go do some work?,"Great.  I will do that.  Sorry, Pam, I just feel a little bit frazzled.  And you know how very rarely I use that word.  Frazzled."
9397,What if it's a girl?,"Irrelevant question.  Section 5A, child shall be male."
9398,Yeah?  ...  Oh.,"Everything is fine.  You don't have to worry.  Try not to think about it.  She's not coming out for a while, okay?"
9399,"Everything is fine.  You don't have to worry.  Try not to think about it.  She's not coming out for a while, okay?",Did you say 'she?'
9400,Did you say 'she?',"I called the doctor like a week ago.  I couldn't wait...  Oh, God, don't be mad."
9401,Mad?  How could I be mad?  We're having a little girl.,Mm-hmm.
9402,"Alright...  Hey, did you change?","Oh, yeah, my water broke."
9403,"Pam, Pam!  Okay, alright, okay, it's time.  Time to go to the hospital.  Somebody get Jim, please!  Is it midnight yet?","No, it's 4:35."
9404,"4:35.  Alright, almost made it.  Almost made it.  Too bad you didn't have sex like seven and a half hours later.  But you had to have the afternoon delight.  I understand.  Sometimes you have to go for it.  Let's go to the hospital, shall we?","No, not yet, Michael."
9405,"Oh, wow, it's almost time for ultra feast!  Where's Kevin?",Oh.  What?  You want to eat cat food with Kevin and not go to the hospital?
9406,Oh.  What?  You want to eat cat food with Kevin and not go to the hospital?,That's fancy feast.  Ultra feast is something they made up so they can pig out together in the name of ceremony.
9407,What is October feast?,"There is no rush to get to the hospital.  I am fine.  I'll get there.  And if I don't get there, I don't get there."
9408,"Our ultra feast menu's theme:  Hollywood.  We have Ratatouille, from Ratatouille, and tandoori chicken, from Born Into Brothels.  I tried to bake a cake like that District 9 prawn thing, but I...  Are you okay?","Mm-hmm.  Yes, I'm fine.  Um, yeah, the doctor said it's still considered a minor contraction as long as I can talk through it."
9409,You know what?  Let's go.  We got to go to the hospital.,"Okay, I'm not going.  I'm not...  It's fine.   [Jim, Michael and Kevin try to help her up] Okay, come on, come on.  No!  I am not going!  I am not going, okay!?  I'm not going today because I can't do it, I don't think I can do it."
9410,"Okay, I'm not going.  I'm not...  It's fine.   [Jim, Michael and Kevin try to help her up] Okay, come on, come on.  No!  I am not going!  I am not going, okay!?  I'm not going today because I can't do it, I don't think I can do it.","Hey, are you kidding me?"
9411,"Hey, are you kidding me?",Are you kidding?
9412,Are you kidding?,"If anyone can do this, you can do this."
9413,How are we doing on contractions?,Two minutes apart.
9414,"We waited too long!  Two minutes doesn't do us any good.  Well, what happened to four and three minutes?","We're okay, Jim!  Okay, Pamela.  You know what time it is?"
9415,"We're okay, Jim!  Okay, Pamela.  You know what time it is?",I don't want to have my baby here.
9416,You're not going to.  You know where you're going?,The hospital.

9418,"Go bag's in the car...  Keys, my keys, where's my keys?",Go bag! Where's my go bag?  Where's my go bag?
9419,Go bag! Where's my go bag?  Where's my go bag?,There's nothing in it.
9420,"You are telling me now that there is nothing in it.  Okay, great!  Oh, hey, hey, um, should I bring a dictionary to the hospital?","The hospital provides dictionaries, bring a thesaurus!"
9421,Has anyone checked how dilated she is?  This is ridiculous!,"Dwight, get away!"
9422,"Dwight, what is the traffic like?",Doesn't matter.  I'll escort you!
9423,What!?,This is where I saw that deer last week.
9424,Where?,Right over by that fence.
9425,By the bushes?,"Okay, Michael!  Focus!"
9426,"Okay, just breathe...  She?  You found out?  Come on, guys.  I wanted to be surprised.",Michael!
9427,Yeah?,"Stop texting, put your phone away!  Come on."
9428,"I'm texting about you, okay!?","Ugh, alright.  [as he puts a police siren on top of his car]  Let's move!  ...  What?"
9429,"Ugh, alright.  [as he puts a police siren on top of his car]  Let's move!  ...  What?",Pull over!
9430,Are you kidding me?,"Pull over!  [Dwight begins throwing various weapons out of the window]  You're not allowed to impersonate a police officer!  Don't make this difficult, Dwight!"
9431,"Okay, so what do you want to do?",I don't know!  Let's go by the house and get it.  It's only twenty minutes past the hospital!
9432,"Pam, no!  Are you nuts?  We're going to the hospital now.","Guys, guys!  Stop fighting, come on.  Come on.  Do you want your kid to come out a lawyer?  Right?  Okay, you know what?  I am all over this.  Here we go.  [as he calls Dwight]  Ready?"
9433,"Guys, guys!  Stop fighting, come on.  Come on.  Do you want your kid to come out a lawyer?  Right?  Okay, you know what?  I am all over this.  Here we go.  [as he calls Dwight]  Ready?",Dwight Schrute.
9434,Why didn't you ask me to do it yesterday?  I kept IM'ing you how bored I was.,Okay.
9435,"Wait, you alright?",Yes.
9436,"Do you have everything, guys?","Michael, just go park the car."
9437,Daddy?  She's ready to push.,Okay.
9438,"Where is my little nibblet?  Halpert, room D1.  Alright, family only beyond this point, thank you.  Here we go.","[as Pam screams]  Doing great, push again."
9439,Why don't you get more ice chips?,"No, Jim, stay!"
9440,"Hey, have you guys seen her?",She hasn't popped yet.
9441,What?  God damn it.  She was supposed to come out yesterday.,"I decided to give baby Halpert a newspaper from the day she was born.  This frame set me back fifty five bones.  But she decided to take her sweet time, so now I have to switch it with today's paper."
9442,"Phyllis, what could you possibly have to do?",I have an ice cream cake in the car.
9443,"Oh, my God.  Go, go, go!  Are you insane?  Alright.","[Pam screams as he approaches the door to their room]  Guys?  Hello?  Um, sorry to be a bother, but if we could have an ETA when this is gonna..."
9444,"[Pam screams as he approaches the door to their room]  Guys?  Hello?  Um, sorry to be a bother, but if we could have an ETA when this is gonna...",This is happening!
9445,"[smoking a cigar]  Yeah, that's right.  It's a baby, see?","Sir!  Sir, you can't smoke that in here.  Put it, put it out."
9446,"[with Jim, holding the baby]  She's incredible.  Want to count her fingers and toes again?","No, let's let her rest.  I'm sure there's still twelve on each."
9447,"Where's the baby?  I want to see the baby.  Oh!  Oh, Helene, hi.  Oh, my goodness, what are the odds of this?  Congratulations on being a grandma.","Hello, Michael."
9448,Ready?,"Mm-hmm.  Oh.  Ooh, wow.  Michael.  Michael."
9449,Who else here is single?,I'm not single.  I have a man. [she grasps Ryan's arm as Ryan has his hand raised to say he's single]
9450,Why do you find someone for yourself instead of meddling in our affairs?,"Okay, show of hands.  Who wants to live in a world where Stanley has two lovers and you don't have any?  [Stanley raises his hand]  Who else?  Come on!  People, I know models!"
9451,"Okay, show of hands.  Who wants to live in a world where Stanley has two lovers and you don't have any?  [Stanley raises his hand]  Who else?  Come on!  People, I know models!","Ha ha, plus size models, maybe."
9452,"Ha ha, you got that right!  Meredith?  Come on, you're obviously single.",You know it.  I am never getting married.
9453,"Andrew, what about you?","Torn scrotum.  Still on the mend, so not good timing."
9454,Remember yesterday when we were terrified of being parents?,We were just kids.  What did we know?
9455,We were just kids.  What did we know?,How we doing?
9456,How we doing?,Great.
9457,Would you like me to take her to the nursery for the night?,Doesn't she sleep here?
9458,Doesn't she sleep here?,She can.  But a lot of parents choose to have the baby spend the first night in the nursery to get some rest.  You've been through a lot.
9459,"Ready?  One, two, three...","One, and then wrap around.  It's okay.  Hold that arm down."
9460,How you doing?,"I don't know.  I just, I can't tell if she's getting anything."
9461,Really?,Doesn't feel right.
9462,"Well, you're pushing the milk out, right?",How does one do that?
9463,How does one do that?,Wasn't it...  It's kinda like a...  Like that.
9464,"Do you want to try it, Jim?",I think you're good.  Doing a good job.
9465,Somebody buzzed?,"Oh!  Really?  Must have sat on it, Pam."
9466,"Oh!  Really?  Must have sat on it, Pam.",I can't tell if she's getting anything.  It just doesn't really feel right.
9467,Even if she's not getting anything?,"Yeah, she'll be fine.  I can always give her a bottle since we're in the nursery."
9468,"Well, I'll bring her back in a little while and we can try again, okay?",Alright.
9469,[in Michael's office]  You wanted to see me?,"What would you say, if I told you that I was about to change your life?"
9470,"What would you say, if I told you that I was about to change your life?","Oh, boy!  ...  What's that sound?"
9471,"Oh, boy!  ...  What's that sound?",[as he appears from behind the door]  Ta-da!
9472,"Okay, hold on.  Whoa, whoa, whoa.  You got to let the cookies cool before you pop 'em in your mouth.  Why don't you guys get to know each other?  Maybe have lunch together?","Erin, would you have lunch with me?"
9473,"Erin, would you have lunch with me?",Okay.
9474,"Michael, could I talk to you privately?","Sure.  Kevin, please leave."
9475,Really?,"No, Kevin doesn't have an elephant heart.  But he is very sensitive.  And it won't kill Erin just to go and have lunch with him in the break room like I promised him...  I bet his heart is enlarged, though."
9476,You see that?  I'm pretty sure she's...  Hi.,Did you grow up around here?
9477,Did you grow up around here?,No.
9478,"So, you must have grown up around somewhere else?",Yes.
9479,"Why was I hiding behind the plant?  Ha, well, in college, I took a botony class, and there was lots of drama in that class.  Uh, kids would gossip about me, so I would eavesdrop on them by hiding behind different plants in the botony class.  And then, uh, they would say things like 'Oh, this guy's going to fail this class,' or, 'What's this guy doing spying on us from behind plants?'  And then I would jump out of them and confront them, and be like, 'Oh, you think all I do is hide behind plants and spy on people?  Busted.' ...  Oh, the reason?  The reason I was hiding behind that plant in this situation was that I thought that Erin and Kevin were kind of hitting it off, and...  I was jealous.","Uh, hi, Pam Halpert?"
9480,"Uh, hi, Pam Halpert?",Yes?
9481,Yes?,Hi.  I'm Clark.  Josie said you might benefit from a lactation consultant.
9482,Yup.  Really great.  When's she available?,"Actually, uh, I'm the consultant.  Got milk?  Ha ha.  Alright, let's see what we're working with."
9483,"Actually, uh, I'm the consultant.  Got milk?  Ha ha.  Alright, let's see what we're working with.","So, uh, biggest thing, besides not being able to get her to latch..."
9484,"When you're feeding, you want to press in like this, make your hand in a C.  Uh, does that hurt?","No, I mean, it feels...  pressure."
9485,Are you sure it doesn't hurt?,No.  It just feels like pressure.
9486,"Okay, well.  Feel how I'm flicking the nipple?  Like that?",Yup.
9487,"Well, you're doing a good job.  Just stay relaxed, and I'll come back in a bit to check on you.  Okay?",Okay.
9488,What?,"Shoot, she fell off."
9489,"Will you just, will you grab Clark real quick?",No need.  I saw him do it.  I can try it.
9490,"[on the phone]  Hey, what's up, kid?",Have you had a chance to look over the revisions on the contract I've prepared for you?
9491,Have you had a chance to look over the revisions on the contract I've prepared for you?,"Nothing left to do except dot the I's, the J's, and the umlauts.  Why don't you meet me here at exactly mid-late afternoon?"
9492,"Nothing left to do except dot the I's, the J's, and the umlauts.  Why don't you meet me here at exactly mid-late afternoon?",I look forward to it.
9493,Hmm?,Get the baby.  Get her.  Come on.
9494,"Oh, my God, this is agonizing.  Look, Kevin, do you really think that you could have dated Erin?",You said she liked me.
9495,"This isn't about me, and that is debatable.  And I have a personality, where as you...  Yes, Andy?",[he hits his head on the desk after ducking out of the way from hiding behind a plant]  Ow.
9496,"Hey.  Pam, she's gorgeous.  Can I hold her?","Yes.  She was a little fussy earlier, but she's totally quieted down.  Here, let me just, uh, let me just burp her.  I don't want her to spit up on you.  Come here, sweety...  Oh, my God!  Wrong baby!"
9497,What?,Wrong baby!  This is not our baby!  Sshh.
9498,"[waking up]  Oh,has she been fussing long?","No, not at all."
9499,How's it going?,"Well, I feel like she needs to eat, but she won't latch on, which is weird, because the other baby di..."
9500,Bottles are fine.  A lot of babies grow up using bottles.  So are you excited to bring your baby home?,"We definitely are.  At 3:00, right?  You said we could stay until 3:00?"
9501,"We definitely are.  At 3:00, right?  You said we could stay until 3:00?","Yeah, you can.  It's 2:35."
9502,Twenty five minutes.  And you're all set with the car seat?,"Yes, car seat's right there."
9503,"Or it could be a half hour, if you need it to be...  Can we get a late checkout?  I don't...  I don't think she heard me.","[entering the Halpert house]  Hello?  Dwight?  What, what are you doing here?"
9504,"[entering the Halpert house]  Hello?  Dwight?  What, what are you doing here?","Isabelle.  Hello...  Yeah, the uh, kitchen was disgusting, so..."
9505,All I did was bring macaroni and cheese...  Where's the fridge?,"Oh, it's...  In the backyard.  I'll take this."
9506,"Are they now?  Ha ha, how some people spend their money, right?  Ha ha.",Yeah...
9507,Are you really sure we should be leaving?,Yeah.
9508,"But you hear the baby crying, right?",Mm-hmm...  Where's your car?
9509,Mm-hmm...  Where's your car?,"Uh, it's in the lot."
9510,"The fax says 'Erin, will you have dinner with me?' from Andy, and the number is our office fax number.","It's busy.  Why don't I keep trying, and then I'll give you the confirmation in a bit?"
9511,"It's busy.  Why don't I keep trying, and then I'll give you the confirmation in a bit?","Sorry, that's unacceptable.  I need you to send it immediately, or you're fired."
9512,Yes.  Do you have a day in mind?,"Yeah, what day?  What day?"
9513,"Yeah, what day?  What day?",Everyday is fine.  Or...
9514,"Well, that, what's that one?",Thursday?
9515,Thursday?,Okay.  Let's do it.
9516,Would you like me to help you up out of the chair?,"Oh, yeah, sorry."
9517,"Okay, alright, thanks...  Okay, do you want to eat?  You want to try eating?  Okay...  Okay, let me...  Just you and me.  Come on.  There we go...  Yeah...  Oh, yeah.  Like that.  There we go.  You got it.",Five tickets on the windshield...  Hey.
9518,"You used my move, didn't you?",I used a variation of your move.
9519,"And now you, two forms of ID, please...  Alright, all is in order.  I just need your signature...  What is it?",Nothing.
9520,Alright.  How would you like to celebrate?,Just pour yourself a cup of apple juice.  I feel sick...  [Jim and Pam walk in to their house with the baby]  I couldn't find the iPod...  Give me a couple days.  I'll be out of your hair.
9521,"I don't want to bring my friends, why can't it just be the two of us?","Because it's St. Patrick's Day, people go out in groups."
9522,Well why don't you invite your friends?,Why are you being so weird about this?
9523,Why are you being so weird about this?,"Stop fighting. Just on St Patrick's Day, okay? Just one perfect day a year. No hassles, no problems, no kids."
9524,"Stop fighting. Just on St Patrick's Day, okay? Just one perfect day a year. No hassles, no problems, no kids.",Why no kids?
9525,Why no kids?,"Yeah, where are your kids?"
9526,"Yeah, where are your kids?",Nope. Nuh -uh. Not today!
9527,What do we got here?,Mega-Desk.
9528,I'm sorry but is that a gift I see in your hands?,It is. This is a little something for you to remember your time here in Scranton by.
9529,[pulls out glass cube with coal.] Is that a lump of coal?,Yes it is!
9530,Have I been that naughty?,"No, no no- that is a good gift actually. Buildings here in Scranton are literally powered by coal."
9531,"Erin and I have our first date tonight, and it has to be perfect. Why? Because according to 'How I Met Your Mother' that's the date that your kids are going to wait patiently to hear about, and you better have a good story for them.",No. [re-enters bullpen from kitchen.]
9532,Oh come on. Come on. Five more minutes? Five more minutes of Mega-Desk? Please?,"[swats over various photos and knickknacks, points at paperwork] Is this yours or mine?"
9533,"[swats over various photos and knickknacks, points at paperwork] Is this yours or mine?",They say that no man is an island. False! I am an island and this island is volcanic. And it is about to erupt. With the molten hot lava of strategy!
9534,"It's kind of like that lip thing she did last night, like a half snarl, half smile? I get the sense that she's very ironic.",Okay. Love you. We'll talk soon. [hangs up phone]
9535,"Must be amazing being a father right, a miracle of life?",It is. Big time.
9536,Is that what happened to you?,"I'll tell you what happened to me. I didn't see my father for the first two years of my life. I thought my mother was my father, and my wet-nurse was my mother."
9537,"Turned out fine for me. But Mose? Oh. Same story, different ending.",Hey! [Erin sneezing at desk] Are you sick?
9538,Hey! [Erin sneezing at desk] Are you sick?,"Oh, no I'm fine, I just have a little indigestion."
9539,In your nose?,Yes.  [Angela returns to desk and puts embroidered breathing mask on]
9540,"Thank you. You know I get way too many ideas from the top. Now I want to hear your ideas. I mean, did you guys know that Liquid Paper? That wasn't invented by some fancy engineer. No, that was created by a lowly typist.","Jo, I have an idea, for suntan lotion - soap."
9541,"In the training manual it says, that there is a minority executive training program in Tallahassee?","I am so proud of Sabre's 'Print In All Colors' initiative. Any Sabre employee of color, is welcome to apply. [Kelly applauds]  Daryl?"

9543,But you wouldn't need more trucks?,Not at all. There's a way that it can be scheduled. I sketched this out downstairs.
9544,[Looks over his proposal] I like this Daryl. I like this a lot. Maybe you should be doing your sketching upstairs. Would you like an office up here?,Are you serious?
9545,Are you serious?,Yeah. Take Jim's old office.
9546,"Okay. Any questions? Anything on anybody's mind? I'm leaving tonight, this is your last chance for a while!","Oh no! Say it's not so, Jo, we're gonna miss you, we're gonna miss you so much!"

I think you should check with my office, before you book any dates, okay?","You know what, in the spirit of full disclosure, I have actually reserved a bunch of different seats on a bunch of different flights, but there are a couple of flights that only have two tickets left, so I think we should pull the trigger and -"

9559,Oh no no no!  Are you feeling ill?,Uh...

9563,You sure?,You'll probably feel better once you get some pants on. Come on.
9564,"Not bad, huh?","A real Hoop Dreams story you got there. Oh man, you seem to have caught Jo's eye. How'd you make that happen?"
9565,"A real Hoop Dreams story you got there. Oh man, you seem to have caught Jo's eye. How'd you make that happen?",I impressed her with my good ideas.
9566,"Hm mm. Seriously, how did you do it?",I made a suggestion at the meeting that was good. You were there.
9567,"How do I put this delicately? Does her family owe your family something, in terms of a past injustice?","Now Mike, I have to ask you to leave, so that I can learn about this tiny television."
9568,"Mm? Well, the clock says chatting time, so.","Well, if you feel like you've done a solid days work..."
9569,Right. What?,"Well I mean, if you can put your name on this day, and be proud of the amount of work you've done, then, by all means, you should toodle on home."
9570,Anything else I can help you with?,"No, no, no. That's super-clear-ish. [Exits, closes door, takes off coat.] Nope. Nope. Nope. Nope."
9571,"Hey what's up, Butt-plug?",How you doing stud? You already there?

9575,Hey! Me and Creed are in. Are you guys in?,Oh I'm in.
9576,"Ah. Got a little client meeting at Shanny O'Gannigan's tonight. It shouldn't go all night long, so if you'd like me to, I could swing by your house so the baby can experience a strong male presence. [Jim is silent] No? Nothing? Okay. Have fun working. [Whistles 'Cat's in the Cradle' song]","Hi there Jo. Sorry to interrupt. Um, this evening [phone rings] I have..."
9577,Hello?,"Hey Jo, it's Jim Halpert. I actually scheduled a meeting at 7:30 with a very important client. And it's so weird, because we never have meetings after 5pm. But I was hoping that maybe just this once, it would be okay."
9578,Sorry Sugar. What'd you want?,"Well, you see, I actually do have a meeting. With a client. I'm just gonna reschedule for next week."
9579,Hey! What are you fellas doing up here?,We're here to bust you out!
9580,Dude! Your shirt tucked in?,"Oh. Yeah, um, I must have did that when I was in the bathroom.  All right then, uh, let me get to it."
9581,It is? I'm sorry.,"Yeah, have some more blanket."
9582,What's up?,Whoa!
9583,"Are we rotating seats, or?","Oh yeah, you're the guest. Take the easy chair, best seat in the house. Plus, you don't have to sit next to this big dork and her smelly feet."
9584,"So, how does the whole foster sibling thing work? Do you guys share one parent or-?",None. We were in the same house from ages ten to twelve. And then from fifteen to eighteen.
9585,How late do we have to work tonight?,You never know with Jo. Sometimes we're here til midnight. Sometimes she doesn't show up for three days.
9586,Why does she do that? Why doesn't she just tell you what your schedule is?,"Yeah, that would be awesome. I could get a girlfriend. Wouldn't have to go to Amsterdam seven times a year. But uh, I'm young, right?  I will date when I'm dead! [Laughs]"
9587,"Yeah, that would be awesome. I could get a girlfriend. Wouldn't have to go to Amsterdam seven times a year. But uh, I'm young, right?  I will date when I'm dead!

9795,[in Michael's car] Did you have a... did you like your lunch? Did you have a good lunch? Did you like that? Did you enjoy your food? It was good. I liked my lunch.,[feels a pain in her breast] Ooh. Ah-ah-ah. Ha-ha.
9796,What's up?,Her milk is coming in. She's getting uncomfortable.
9797,"That's weird, my breast pump is missing. Have you seen my breast pump?","[removes jacket, applies hand sanitizer] All right, this is gonna traumatize me a hell of a lot more than you, believe me."
9798,"You know what, Dwight? Let me just check the bathroom first. Okay?",Really? Fine. Let your breasts explode. Three squeezes and I would drain you.
9799,Really? Fine. Let your breasts explode. Three squeezes and I would drain you.,"Mm. [walks into bathroom, Meredith is using her brest pump] Meredith!"
9800,What are you doing?!,Just relax. Okay.
9801,Relax?!,This is like the Cadillac of pumps.
9802,We're both girls. Who cares?,So... how was lunch?
9803,So... how was lunch?,Lunch was fine.
9804,Was it everything that you hoped and dreamed it might be?,"I don't know. It was lunch, Andy."
9805,Erin? I think we're out of fax cover sheets.,"God, Oscar, will you keep your pants on? It's easy."
9806,"God, Oscar, will you keep your pants on? It's easy.","[using a Cookie Monster voice] 'My name is Kevin, I'm an accountant.' See I did the voice."
9807,"Uh, it's not organic. Do you know what I mean?",Jim does a really good one. Do yours.
9808,"Guys, why don't we leave the parodies to the pros at Mad TV?","Sorry, Gabe, but that show hasn't been on in many cookies.'"
9809,"Hey. Can I have your attention please? First of all, thanks to everyone for helping put this awesome party together. And a very special shout-out to the chair of the Party Planning Committee, miss Angela Martin. You have outdone yourself.","You know what, I think we can all agree that Angela's not so great, so.."
9810,Can we talk about this in private?,I don't want to be in private. Is it true or is it not?
9811,I don't want to be in private. Is it true or is it not?,Yes.
9812,Who else did you sleep with? Did you sleep with Phyllis or Kelly or Pam? Maybe all together?,"No, no never."
9813,Did everyone know? Was I the only one who didn't know?,Yeah pretty much.
9814,Who are you?! I don't know you! [pushes someone away to leave],"I should probably get involved in this, but I think my energy is better spent on the Cookie Monster issue."
9815,"What? What do you mean, suspend me?",I think you need to go a little easy. You can't just suspend someone form work.
9816,"Yeah, you're right. You know what? Um, you're suspended too Jim. [Dwight starts to clap] Ok fine. You too Dwight.","Wait, What? I was just slow-clapping your no-nonsense decision-making."
9817,"Wait, What? I was just slow-clapping your no-nonsense decision-making.",I don't want to hear it. Suspended.
9818,Why would that be something to talk about on Secretary's Day?,"Andy, she's not the easiest person in the world to have a conversation with. All right? And besides, who doesn't tell their girlfriend that they were engaged to someone who works four feet away from them? That's like.. that's like Mr. and Mrs. Smith crap."
9819,"Andy, she's not the easiest person in the world to have a conversation with. All right? And besides, who doesn't tell their girlfriend that they were engaged to someone who works four feet away from them? That's like.. that's like Mr. and Mrs. Smith crap.","I was going to tell her, just on my own time."
9820,"Who cares? I mean it's not like I killed someone. Big deal right? This can blow over in two seconds. She never asked me. So, if you think about it... I probably should have told her I guess. Everybody does stupid things.",Psst. Hey. Erin.
9821,You think I want people remembering I had sensual relations with Andy? It's the kind of thing you wish you could have annulled. I want to throw up just thinking about it.,I want to throw up just thinking about it.
9822,Really?,Yeah. And he worked here too.
9823,"It was Andy, wasn't it?","No, no it wasn't Andy. It wasn't. It doesn't matter. It's not about who you've been with. It's about who you end up with. Sometimes the heart doesn't know what it wants until it finds what it wants."
9824,"Hey everyone. Hi. Quite an afternoon, huh? Cathartic in a way. I'm glad I got to share it with you. It makes you think about what's really important. [Pam hands Jim a note] It's not about showing you're in charge or flexing some sort of authority. It's about forgiveness. And yes, I'm talking about you three in this desk clump right here. I think that, if you were to apologize to me, then I would revoke your suspension.",I don't think an apology is enough. I really think the only way for me to learn my lesson is to take my suspension.
9825,Trust is the most important thing to me. Is your name Andy Bernard? What's your real name? Lionel Frankenstein?,"Will you stop walking for one second? That's it. There's no other secrets. Ok? I mean yeah, my chest is not naturally hairless, and my parents pay my credit card bill."
9826,"Will you stop walking for one second? That's it. There's no other secrets. Ok? I mean yeah, my chest is not naturally hairless, and my parents pay my credit card bill.",How long were you guys together?
9827,How long were you guys together?,A year.
9828,A year? You were together for a year?,Yeah but that's it. Now you know everything about me. I promise. And if I think of anything else...
9829,I think I have to be on my own for a little bit. Like the girl Precious in Precious. Based on the novel Push by Sapphire. Ok?,I didn't see that movie.
9830,Do they still get paid?,It's tacky to discuss finances. It's best to pretend that this never happened.
9831,Can I buy everyone coffees? [everyone shakes their heads] [in Cookie Monster voice] 'Or cookies.',What was that? Are you kidding me? Was that an impression?
9832,What was that? Are you kidding me? Was that an impression?,Alright.
9833,Ciao' Right? 'Ciao. I say Ciao because I'm fancy from Tallahassee.',Why don't we say ciao to the impressions? [everyone says ciao]
9834,Why don't we say ciao to the impressions? [everyone says ciao],[sitting on bench outside groaning]
9835,Erin?,Oh. Sorry I thought everyone was gone.
9836,"No, no, I was just watching Cookie Monster. It finally downloaded. Mind if I sit down?",I can't trust Andy anymore.
9837,"Ahh! You said it! You know who you would love? Oh, this guy in my neighborhood, Tom Dizemore. This is him: 'Hey! Hey Scott!'","Sometimes telling someone something is hard. Well, at least someone made her happy on Secretary's Day."
9838,Why didn't you do Oscar the Grouch?,That would have been funny.
9839,"[walking up] Oh, oh, I was just watching that. Did you do that, man? 'Oscar. I am the Count.' Nailed him. Nailed him. [Gives Kevin a fist pump] Good work Cookie Monster.",Thank you.
9840,"Buenos dias, Miguel. Como estas? Bien? Claro que si! Yo estoy fantastico. Que pasa?","Ha ha! Buenos dias, Dwight!"
9841,That's what he says?',"Damn it. [knock on door] Ah, Angelo."
9842,Can you smell the power of the Halperts? Power couple.,"You know what? I should be getting this client, Michael. My numbers are better than either of theirs."
9843,"You know what? I should be getting this client, Michael. My numbers are better than either of theirs.",I went with the people I thought would put the best face on the company.
9844,"If you want people to put the best face on something, why would you get two people who probably never cut the face off of anything in their lives?",[whispers] That's a good point.
9845,How are you?,Did somebody order a hooker over here?
9846,Did somebody order a hooker over here?,"[laughing] Oh, stop that."
9847,Hi. How are you?,"There's this woman I met a few weeks ago. Her name is Donna, the manager of Sid & Dexter's and, right now, we're in the midst of a passionate love affair. Um, no. But she is coming by today. Maybe to buy some printers, so..."
9848,"Sorry to interrupt. Sorry to interrupt. Do you, Donna, by any chance shop at Victoria's Secret?",What?
9849,What?,Because I keep getting these magazines sent to me via the address of the woman who used to live in my condo before me.
9850,What is this?,"Oh, this is 'Print in All Colors,' Sabre's minority executive training program."
9851,How do I apply?,You have to be a minority.
9852,"Uh, glasses wearers. Cholera survivors. Geniuses. Non-organic family farmers. The list goes on and on. You want me to keep going?",Those don't really count. We're thinking more ethnic and racial minorities.
9853,Hmm?,"Ten seconds ago, this guy was driving a forklift. Okay? Now all off a sudden he's Cinderella of the office. What are you guys thinking?"
9854,"Ten seconds ago, this guy was driving a forklift. Okay? Now all off a sudden he's Cinderella of the office. What are you guys thinking?",Well...
9855,I like the sound of this. [looks at Dwight] Maybe one day I'll be sitting in Michael's chair. Wouldn't that be something?,"One minority from this branch is going to get into this program. Who would I refer? Hmm... the competent, hardworking one who does things his own way, or the malleable simpleton who can be bought for a few fashion magazines?"
9856,"One minority from this branch is going to get into this program. Who would I refer? Hmm... the competent, hardworking one who does things his own way, or the malleable simpleton who can be bought for a few fashion magazines?","[on phone] This is the second time that you've sent me the wrong size. I mean, I know what a four feels like. I've been a four my whole life. You know what? You can go to Hell. All right? Thanks for nothing."
9857,"[on phone] This is the second time that you've sent me the wrong size. I mean, I know what a four feels like. I've been a four my whole life. You know what? You can go to Hell. All right? Thanks for nothing.","Oh, man. White people, right?"
9858,"Oh, man. White people, right?",I don't know if she was white.
9859,"I know, 'cause you have no role models. How many Indian CEO's can you think of?","I can't think of any CEO's, any race."
9860,Who took the photo?,Ryan.
9861,Jim! Could you come in here for a sec? What was that printer we were looking at?,"[in his office] You didn't see it, Pam. She was giving me all sorts of signals that she wanted me to make a move. Shortbread?"
9862,"[in his office] You didn't see it, Pam. She was giving me all sorts of signals that she wanted me to make a move. Shortbread?",No.
9863,"Oh really, Jim? What about Pam? And you did a heck of a lot more than kiss. Maybe this could be my Pam.","Okay. Well, all that is irrelevant."
9864,"Was it professional? No. But I work in the nightlife industry. I get hit on all the time. In my 20's it would have been annoying. In my late 20's, I find it really flattering.","Look, I know that I screwed up in there. I know that I probably messed up your sale. I just want to go in and fix it."
9865,What if I back out and you finish the pitch with Jim?,What?
9866,What?,What was that?
9867,What was that?,Just let him flirt with her. People meet each other all sorts of ways.
9868,Who cares? [Michael peeking at them through his office window] It's not that huge a sale.,"Hey, the Schwab guy told us to treat every sale like it was a huge sale."
9869,How as being a minority affected you?,"Well, there's a lot of pressure from my parents to settle down and marry an Indian guy."
9870,[tries it by crossing his arms] Like that? [to Andy],Is this... is this the best you can do right there?
9871,Is this... is this the best you can do right there?,"Uh, for that printer, yes. Unfortunately we don't have a lot of flexibility."
9872,"So maybe we could find a little wiggle room, right?",What's that?
9873,What's that?,Maybe wee find some wiggle room?
9874,Maybe wee find some wiggle room?,I don't... I don't think so.
9875,"Okay, well sometimes... sometimes it makes financial sense to lose money, right? Like for tax purposes.","Actually, ran the numbers on this, and in this case, it makes more financial sense to gain money."
9876,Why don't you run them again?,What if she's just flirting with you to get a better price?
9877,What if she's just flirting with you to get a better price?,"If she is, it's working."
9878,You can flirt with someone to get what you want and also be attracted to them. How do you think we got together?,cause I stopped by your desk like 15 times a day.
9879,[typing] Can you stop micromanaging? I know how to do this.,Okay...
9880,Hey... what are you guys doing?,"This girl was really rude to me at the mall. So I created a fake I.M. account from a hot guy at her high school, and now I'm trying to make her anorexic."
9881,Ryan? What does he know?,It's easy... you just turn every question around on them. Do you think you're treated differently because of your race?
9882,It's easy... you just turn every question around on them. Do you think you're treated differently because of your race?,Would you ask that same question if I was white? We're so in.
9883,Would you ask that same question if I was white? We're so in.,We?'
9884,We?',"When I become executive, I'm gonna make Ryan manager."
9885,Operating blahdy blahdy blah. Boilerplate. Pound of fish. [Donna laughing] Just kidding. Do you like mints?,Yes.
9886,I carry mints with me sometimes. You ever tried those?,"Oh, I haven't tried those. No."
9887,You want one?,Sure.
9888,"Well, why don't you just move the M&M's?","Well, why don't you shut up!"
9889,Okay. What do you think?,"I think it's over, man."
9890,Andy?,Ehh.
9891,Pam?,Hmm?
9892,Hmm?,What do you think?
9893,What do you think?,"Um... I think it's really, really unlikely."
9894,What?,"I'm not saying she's in love with him. But she could have left a while ago. Most printer sales are done over the phone, Ms. Boob shirt."
9895,"What sort of movie would Rudy have been if he had just stopped, given up, after two rejections? Would have been a lot shorter. Probably been a lot funnier. But it would have ultimately been a disappointment. I still would have seen it, but that's not... the point.",Kelly is disqualified!
9896,What?,"You said the program is not open to Caucasians. Well... anthropologically, she is Indian. Indians migrated from the caucuses region of Europe. Therefore, technically, she is Caucasian. You're welcome, America."
9897,"Darryl withdrew his application. He said the Yale program interfered with his softball league, you know? He's gone.","I got my whole life to be a minority executive. I only have about a year left in these knees, though."
9898,"Oh, dear God. Okay. Don't make any decisions just yet. Okay? I'll be right back.",Hello.
9899,"Yeah. I don't want to be offensive but, uh... may I ask you what that means?","I do find that offensive, actually."
9900,Thank you. Did I... get everything?,I don't know. I think so.
9901,"[whispers] Okay. So... Oh, Donna?",Yeah? Do you need validation? We don't... we don't validate.
9902,Yeah? Do you need validation? We don't... we don't validate.,"No, it's just in the lot, so..."
9903,"Oh, what's that out there?","Michael, how did it go? [Michael goes in his office and closes door]"
9904,"Michael, how did it go? [Michael goes in his office and closes door]",How would one of you feel if I told you I could put you on a fast track to an executive position at this company?
9905,How would one of you feel if I told you I could put you on a fast track to an executive position at this company?,Holy cow. I'd be so happy.
9906,I can protect you from Kelly. [Erin stifles laugh] Will you get out of here? Seriously. [Erin turns and leaves kitchen],"For hobbies, um, yoga, belly dancing, snake charming. Beds of nails. I like lying on them."
9907,Dwight: What are you doing?,Helping heal America in a dramatic fashion in the 11th hour.
9908,"Caucasians, am I right? [to Hide] Have a seat. I'll translate.",Why? I don't need translator.
9909,Why? I don't need translator.,You don't know what you need. Just...
9910,"Hey, Michael. [Michael is sitting on couch outside his office] How you doing?",I don't know. I don't know. Can't really trust my feelings anymore.
9911,"You know what, Michael? For what it's worth... I was wrong, too. I thought she was interested in you.",She suckered you too.
9912,Was it the cleavage?,"Yeah, and the shoulder cutouts."
9913,"Michael, I think Donna left this here. Should I put it in the lost and found for 14 days and then I can take it home?",God. She left this here?
9914,God. She left this here?,Yeah.
9915,What?,No.
9916,"Oh, my God, thank you so much. I love that denim jumpsuit you have. How much?",Oh. Actually I was thinking about clothes that I was just gonna give to Goodwill anyway.
9917,"Just once, I would like to be a puppet master and have nothing go wrong. Is that too much to ask?",You know what? Everybody told me that you weren't interested. Everybody. And I didn't believe 'em. And they were right. So... there's your barrette.
9918,You know what? Everybody told me that you weren't interested. Everybody. And I didn't believe 'em. And they were right. So... there's your barrette.,"No, y-you were... right."
9919,Who?,You were right.
9920,About what?,You were right. [Michael leans into Donna's car to kiss her and they kiss passionately] I'm sorry.
9921,[returns to office] What happened?,Kelly got into the minority training program.
9922,"Really?! Oh, that's great. That's such good news. I did it! [all look at him] I kissed. We kissed.",Ooh.
9923,You know what? It doesn't matter. Because I know it happened. And that is all that counts. [shouts] I did do it!,Stop it!
9924,Stop what?,"You're talking about me in Morse Code. Well, you know what? Joke's on you 'cause I know Morse Code. Ha!"
9925,"You're talking about me in Morse Code. Well, you know what? Joke's on you 'cause I know Morse Code. Ha!","[chuckles] Yeah. That's what we're doing. In our very limited free time and with our very limited budget, we went and got a nanny and then we went out and took a class on a very outmoded and very unnecessary form of communication just so we could talk about you in front of you."
9926,Very well. I must have imagined it. I apologize. [Pam clacking her stapler and Jim responding with tapping his keyboard rhythmically] Detonator. Detonator where? Michael!,Jim. Are you clicking a detonator?
9927,Jim. Are you clicking a detonator?,It's a pen.
9928,"Who enjoys the weekends? [all raise hands] Of course. Now the weekend is always great if you have someone, which I do. I have Donna. She is hot. She has a Pilates butt. But we need to find something to do this weekend beside have sex. Did I say that? Yes, I did. [all nod] And the reason you are here is that I need ideas for things that Donna and I could do on the weekend.  So just shout it out.",I have an idea for your weekend.
9929,"Wait, that's crazy far. Are you sure she's not cheating?","You know what, Kelly? This is the real world. Not The Real World: Scranton. Oh my God, this is super weird. When Ryan had two girlfriends, he used to take me to some diner in Hazelton just so the other girl wouldn't see."
9930,"You know what, Kelly? This is the real world. Not The Real World: Scranton. Oh my God, this is super weird. When Ryan had two girlfriends, he used to take me to some diner in Hazelton just so the other girl wouldn't see.",Some diner?! It was the Starlight Diner! It's in a LIFE magazine spread about Americana.
9931,Some diner?! It was the Starlight Diner! It's in a LIFE magazine spread about Americana.,You guys think Donna's cheating on me?
9932,You guys think Donna's cheating on me?,"No, Michael, no."
9933,Are you nuts?,You had a nice meal with your girlfriend in a lovely place...
9934,How?,How what?
9935,How what?,How do I not make any more of it?
9936,How do I not make any more of it?,You could start by concluding this meeting.
9937,How many dates have you been on?,Nine dates. I said it on the second date.
9938,"Does she keep her phone locked around you, Michael? Does she watch how much she drinks around you, Michael?",Does she leave the room when she takes phone calls? Does she keep perfume in her purse? Does she shower before sex? Does she shower after sex? Does she...
9939,Does she leave the room when she takes phone calls? Does she keep perfume in her purse? Does she shower before sex? Does she shower after sex? Does she...,"Yeah, she does all that."
9940,Run what?,"Amok. It means, don't let your imagination run out of control."
9941,"Why didn't you just say that, Pam?","Michael, do not let your imagination run out of control."
9942,You do?,"Yes, Jim, I do. And I can't stay in a relationship that is full of lies and deceit."
9943,This is you. How much do you charge?,"$100 a day, plus expenses."
9944,"There's no way that you guys have any almond butter, right?","Yeah, I don't know. Look, one of my clients called. He was in the middle of a big printing job and the back of the printer started smoking and then the paper tray caught on fire."
9945,What are we gonna do about this?,"I don't know. Call HQ, see if they know anything. Yeah. That's what I'll do today. All right. Yeah."
9946,What do you mean?,You didn't feel like he was hiding something?
9947,You didn't feel like he was hiding something?,I don't know.
9948,Like he was... covering something up? Maybe.,"Two years ago, Andy blamed the warehouse for a late shipment that he forgot to process. We got yelled at pretty bad. Almost lost my job, and I was mad as hell at the time. But I said 'Darryl, just wait. He's a fool. There's gonna be an opportunity. Just be patient.' [smiles]"
9949,"That's interesting. Wow, it's a little early for ice cream, don't you think?","It's never too early for ice cream, Jim. But we didn't have any ice cream, so this is mayonnaise and black olives."
9950,"It's comfort food, all right? [disgustedly] God.","You know Michael, this whole Donna thing is gonna be okay, you just... stop beating yourself up."
9951,Why do we have to see what Dwight says?,Because I have him investigating her. I'm waiting for a text update.
9952,Stop eating it! Do you wanna be happy? Look at you. You have a major self-destructive streak in you.,I know.
9953,Helene?,My mother.
9954,You okay?,"Yeah, I'm good. Hey, you know an exercise for two people that uses the whole body?"
9955,"Yeah, I'm good. Hey, you know an exercise for two people that uses the whole body?","[chuckles] Yeah, I think I know what you're talking about."
9956,[moaning loudly on exercise machine while staring at Donna who's next to him] Oh. Oh. Oh. [groans loudly] One thing you need to know about me. I don't quit until something tears or pops. [chuckles] You look like you're getting a good workout. Can I feel your pulse?,"Nope. I'm good, thanks."
9957,"Really? Hey, um... [Dwight gets up and walks sorely from his 'workout']","Look, young man, can you wipe down that seat?"
9958,"Look, young man, can you wipe down that seat?",Get out of my way. Huh!
9959,"Tomorrow's fertilizer, am I right?",I'm out of here.
9960,"Donna. Donna, wait, please. I'm sorry. Okay? Listen. We both know why I'm here: to see... you... naked... while... I'm... naked.","You stay away from me, or I'm calling security."
9961,You're back. What happened?,"Oh, I pulled muscles in both my thighs. Thanks for asking."
9962,"No, what happened with Donna?","Yeah, no. She's not cheating. Oh, man! Will you help me work out this knot? Right here. [near his groin]"
9963,"Yeah, no. She's not cheating. Oh, man! Will you help me work out this knot? Right here. [near his groin]",Ugh!
9964,No. No! Are you sure?,"I'm positive. Yeah, oh, and here's your expense receipts right there."
9965,Who eats eight protein bars?,People who don't trust egg whites.
9966,"What? No, she didn't say that.","You're right. I was paraphrasing. What she actually said was, [pulls out notebook] 'What is with him? He is crazy. I'm coming over there to talk to him.' And this was after I have no other recourse but to tell her and gym security that you had me sent there to see if she was cheating. Also, I joined the gym. You'll be billed monthly. [lays down gym membership receipt on a chair in Michael's office."
9967,"You're right. I was paraphrasing. What she actually said was, [pulls out notebook] 'What is with him? He is crazy. I'm coming over there to talk to him.' And this was after I have no other recourse but to tell her and gym security that you had me sent there to see if she was cheating. Also, I joined the gym. You'll be billed monthly. [lays down gym membership receipt on a chair in Michael's office.",I am not paying for that membership.
9968,"No, I like the attention. Is she here yet?","Uh, no. [Michael sighs, Donna enters] Wait, yes."
9969,That's her?,Yeah.
9970,How could you think I would cheat on you?,I didn't. Everybody else here did. Everybody convinced me that something was up. They poisoned my mind.
9971,Have you ever been to Vero Beach?,"Oh, my God, Vero Beach. No. Is that on the water?"
9972,"Oh, my God, Vero Beach. No. Is that on the water?",We're going.
9973,We are?,Yeah.
9974,What's up? I got your e-mail.,Close the door.
9975,Such as?,"It was kind of mumbled, I don't know, uh, only thing I could make out clearly was 'Andy,' 'Problem,' 'Eliminate,' something. I don't know what it meant."
9976,What? You don't know what it meant? How about 'Andy is a problem and we must eliminate him?',Whoa. I hadn't even thought of that.
9977,Did Michael get them for you?,"No, I bought them myself."
9978,Where?,Steamtown Mall.
9979,"Claire's? Zales? Ricky's? Earring, Earrings? Fancy Girl? Platinum Cat? Where?","You know, I actually got them in Philadelphia, in a mall down there."
9980,Franklin Mills? King of Prussia? Springfield? Governor's Place?,"Uh, Franklin Mills."
9981,[to Pam] What?,Hmm? Oh. It's probably nothing.
9982,Hmm? Oh. It's probably nothing.,"Okay, heart-shaped jewelry is not something that a woman buys for herself. A man definitely bought it for her recently, and it wasn't Michael."

10020,Is this the thing where they use an icicle so there's no evidence?,"Yes, we stab Toby through the heart with an icicle."
10021,What flavors did you get? [yawns],It's so exciting Pam. The Eagles are doing a theme of ice creams in honor of turning 60.
10022,[reading flavors] Despera-dough. Witchy-womanilla. Why do they do this?,Do you want me to go back to the store?

10032,How do we know this? I'd like to see a stool sample.,"Dwight, look at my teeth. [shows teeth, beet red]"
10033,Could he still be seeing her?,I don't think he'd do that.
10034,So we're gonna say the most likely scenerio is that Michael matured overnight?,"Well, it happened to Tom Hanks in Big."
10035,Then let's just not do this. Do you have any idea the risks involved?,Hey Michael.
10036,That... exists?,Yes.
10037,"[shouts] Michael Scott, are you still seeing Donna?","Okay, Pam... she's not invisible so stop asking silly questions."
10038,Since when is this an office where we delve into each other's personal lives?,"I like Donna. Is it wrong to keep seeing her? Depends on who you ask. I mean, if you ask her husband... or you took a random poll, yeah, it's wrong."

10040,"I ask... everyone in the room, 'Are you in a relationship?'.","People, this is Scranton. And many people consider that to be the Paris of northeastern Pennsylvania. And in Paris, it is rude for a woman to have less than four lovers."
10041,How does he feel about it?,He is never gonna find out. He is a high school baseball coach. He wakes up early. He goes to bed early. Look at how long it took for him to find out. [points to Andy] It was right under his nose. I had to tell him.
10042,Did Donna tell you that?,Real sports with Bryant Gumble.
10043,You know what? You know what? I am declaring a moment of silence right now. Ten minutes of silence honoring Michael Jackson. just sit there and think about Michael jackson.,"My name is Andy Bernard and I am a cuckold. For those of you unfamiliar with William Shakespeare, a cuckold is a man whose woman is cheating on him. I've lived the part. And let me tell you, I'd so much rather play the part on stage."
10044,"Mm, no, when are you people going to stop casting the first stone? I am not in the wrong here. I am the good guy.",How does that work?
10045,How does that work?,Do you think this husband is a super sweet nice guy? Do you think he's an angel? I don't think so. Why is his wife going off and having a little something-something with me? There has to be a problem with him.
10046,Do you think this husband is a super sweet nice guy? Do you think he's an angel? I don't think so. Why is his wife going off and having a little something-something with me? There has to be a problem with him.,"In any cheating movie, the person getting cheated on is the hero. You're Ali Larter, I'm Beyonce."

10048,"Oh, really? I thought you were the boss.",Let's go. [starts walking towards the elevator] I can't wait to see this jerk who is making me cheat on his wife. I should punch him in the nose for what he's making me do to her.

10058,What?,"So essentially, this comes down to damages. Now, there is some precedence for the range of $30,000."
10059,What?,"I don't have $30,000 lying around. I have it buried very deeply, and I don't want to dig past a certain someone to get it."
10060,"You don't know. You don't-- you don't know anything. Look at him. Look at him over there. High-fiving? He didn't even do anything. Kid did all the work. I bet he does that at home. I bet it's like, 'Hey, Donna, why don't you wash the dishes?' 'High-five, Donna.' 'Hey, why don't you bring me my slippers?' 'Hi-five. I'm taking all the credit.'",Seems pretty well liked by the team.

10062,Intercourse to completion. Five individual times rendered at my discretion?',"Look, I don't think that's actually legal."
10063,"Five times for $30,000? Not a bad stud fee. Better than most horses.",But not in your bed. It's lumpy.
10064,Do you understand how rare is that in nature?,I'm not some farm animal. [Dwight smirks at the camera]
10065,Do I know you?,"No. Uh, just big fans. Both of us."

10068,Of course. Okay? I gotta... get back to this.,Of course.
10069,"Well, that was not at all what I expected. Hoo hoo! Whoo. My heart's still racing. I just looked a man in the eyes and I shook his hand. All the time I was thinking, 'I'm sleeping with your wife.' And you know who does that? James freakin' Bond.","Okay, orange slices. There ya go."

10077,"Cause it's next to they baby section, okay?","All right, that makes more sense. You should have said that at the beginning when you said, 'I read a book about anthropology.'"

10084,You sleep in the warehouse?,"Lightbulb's burnt out, so it's dark. And the heat from the backup generator keeps it nice and warm. Sometimes I think about it when I'm trying to fall asleep at home. But as far as the rest of the office goes, it doesn't exist, okay?"

[chases after her] All right, all right. You know what? I'm sick of this. I'm sick of the little disapproving head shakes. If you think that's going to have any effect on me, it will not. I am going to leave right now and go to a motel to meet Donna.",Why not your condo?
10087,Why not your condo?,"Because a motel is dirty and it is sexy. Like me. And like Donna. And frankly, the stuff that we're into isn't very condo-appropriate."

10093,"[driving in car; returns to office; grabs ice cream out of freezer] How do I feel about breaking up with Donna? Good. Moral. I feel proud. [beeping; cut to Donna who is waiting in the parking lot of the motel] Like a grownup.[Donna receives text from phone] That was not easy because I really liked her a lot. And I'm a little bit emotional right now because I know that I absolutely made the right decision. [Donna has disappointed look; cut back to Michael in his office opening ice cream] At the end of the day, we have to do what's right. And it was either living with myself or... being happy. And I picked... the... former.",Michael Scott?

10101,"Really? A baby otter? Okay, um, count me in as who cares. It's not even that interesting a baby otter, it can't even stand up. [looks toward computer] It's trying to stand up... [choking up] there it goes.",Howdy. I hope I'm not interrupting anything.
10102,Can you now?,"Absolutely. Anyone who talked to the press, please raise your hand."
10103,"So unfair. Even if I thought that our printers killed baby seals, I would not be a whistleblower. The Bernards, for generations, have silenced whistleblowers. It's how we made all our money.

10119,Oh my god. Was she cute?,No.
10120,"I know what it is. I skimmed the first chapter. I'm just curious, why would a man who hates people want to have a relationship with a maid?","Oh, uh, I don't know, uh..."

10122,Why'd you do that?,Her husband's a reporter.
10123,You leaked it?,"I don't know what to do! Do I go tell Jo, or - I don't want everyone to keep blaming the wrong person!"

10133,Michael Scott... what do you know?,What?
10134,What?,It doesn't matter what I know.
10135,Why?,Because I want to deal with it the way I deal with it.
10136,What?,"[as Michael and Jo leave] Are you leaving? Oh, am I... should I continue with the investigation?"
10137,"[as Michael and Jo leave] Are you leaving? Oh, am I... should I continue with the investigation?",Are you going to kill me?

10145,Who's Holly?,Holly Flax from the Nashua branch. Best HR rep that Dunder Mifflin has ever seen. It's not been a blockbuster year for me financially. My Blockbuster stock is down.

10152,You're going to believe that guy?,"When I was growing up, there was nothing better than being a big old business tycoon. And I thought I'd break that glass ceiling and be a hero to all those little girls out there... and they'd make a Barbie out of me."
10153,"I, did I sell cheap printers? I do. But if I have to go out there in front of the press and make one of them public apology recalls, I mean, it's all I'll ever be remembered for. Nobody will want to play with my Barbie.","You know, I would be willing, under the right circumstances, to do that for you."
10154,You don't say? I own a one-eighth share in a rental property down in Pittston.,"Well, I'm one-eighths proud of you... enjoy that chair for now... 'cause pretty soon, you will be on your feet, at Buckingham Palace."
10155,"Hey Phyllis, have you seen my bag?",[points to the ceiling] You deserve it.
10156,"Look, I didn't want houses and schools to burn down, and children to die. Does that make me a hero? I...","[offscreen] No, it does not!"
10157,Andy?,Hey.
10158,"[to press] We at Sabre have betrayed the trust that we have built with our customers. We regret our slow response and our lapse in candor and judgment. At this time, we are issuing a full recall of all Sabre GH400 printers. We will not rest until this problem is solved. There will be no questions. Are there any questions?","Hey, I appreciate you reading that statement. You looked pretty up there."
10159,#NAME?,You make it so hard to love you sometimes.
10160,Are you crazy?,"[song ends] Toby, how did we do?"
10161,"[song ends] Toby, how did we do?","Well, that was better."
10162,Who's the guy who invented the peanut?,"Hey, guys."
10163,"Am I angry that Gabe stole my girlfriend over the summer? No. I've been through anger-management, OK? So right now, I am sitting on a nice beach at Cape Cod, gazing out across the whitecaps. Oh, look, it's a humpback whale. How pretty. He's eating Gabe.",[goes to change thermostat as Dwight puts a locked cover over it] Hey. What are you doing?
10164,[goes to change thermostat as Dwight puts a locked cover over it] Hey. What are you doing?,"From now on, if you're hot, sit on an ice pack."
10165,"Well, what if you're cold?","Like you'd ever be cold, Kevin. Stop asking me hypothetical questions, OK? I'm too busy."
10166,"Like you'd ever be cold, Kevin. Stop asking me hypothetical questions, OK? I'm too busy.","Hey, Dwight, I don't know if you heard, but we're supposed to be drinking out of weird backpacks instead of cups, like regular people.  Oh, you did hear."
10167,"This summer, I did the minority executive training program at Yale. You guys, I'm, like, really smart now. You don't even know. You could ask me, 'Kelly, what's the biggest company in the world?' And I'd be like, 'blah blah blah, blah blah blah blah blah blah,' giving you the exact right answer.",Coffee Monkey's arrived.
10168,It says decaf. You get me decaf?,"Ooh, yeah. Must've been some sort of mix-up there. You could just drink it, or I could drive all the way back?"
10169,"Ooh, yeah. Must've been some sort of mix-up there. You could just drink it, or I could drive all the way back?","My summer, I, um, blew out my knee playing softball. Ended up watching CNN most of the time. I don't know how we're going to get out of Afghanistan. I hate the new assistant. He's only been here for a week, and I hate him."
10170,"New guy sucks. Calls me the Nard-Man. I'm the Nard-Dog, okay? Nard-man is my father.",My name is Luke Cooper. I love cinema. My favorite movies are Citizen Kane and The Boondock Saints.
10171,"He's not the worst, okay? He's not the worst. You know who's the worst? That intern we had a few years ago. That guy-remember? Eeeh! That face, how ugly he was? He was the worst. Good worker, though. [starts drinking coffee] Ah! It's not cappuccino.",He messed yours up to.
10172,"It's just coffee, guys! But, yeah, I'll look into it, okay?","Wow, that's a lot of keys."
10173,Where?,I think they run through these panels and then down under the map. I wouldn't know for sure cause I don't have a trained ear. That's why I have to use one of these. [pulls out stethoscope]
10174,"What happened to me this summer? Dwight bought the building, so actually, this has been the busiest summer of my life.","[Jim quietly takes Dwight's keychain and starts adding keys to it, Pam giggles] Hey, what's so funny over here? Ha. Very nice. Give me my keys. [removes keys and throws them at Jim] Ha. Ha. Not. Funny. Jim."
10175,"[Jim quietly takes Dwight's keychain and starts adding keys to it, Pam giggles] Hey, what's so funny over here? Ha. Very nice. Give me my keys. [removes keys and throws them at Jim] Ha. Ha. Not. Funny. Jim.",Sorry.
10176,Luke? Luke!,"What's up, Venus?"
10177,"What's up, Venus?",Did you send those samples to Justin at Lehigh Motors yesterday? Because he didn't get 'em.
10178,Did you send those samples to Justin at Lehigh Motors yesterday? Because he didn't get 'em.,"Uh, if you asked me to do it, I'm sure I did it. Yeah, strawberries are ripe."
10179,What for?,To get some ice cream for everybody. It's national ice cream afternoon. Great.
10180,Why is there a circle with a line through it?,"That means don't. Haven't you seen Ghostbusters, Pam?"
10181,"That means don't. Haven't you seen Ghostbusters, Pam?","Yeah, but it's like you're saying we should bother Luke."
10182,"Hey, why can't we bother Luke? He deserves it.",Because I don't want it getting back to Sabre that we're yelling at assistants. I think it would reflect poorly on us.
10183,Who's gonna tell on us? Gabe?,"That'd be hilarious. Uh, 'Jo, they're creating a hostile work environment. Stop  'em.'"
10184,How close?,"Well, Dwight, he wiped his butt. Is that close enough for you?"
10185,"Well, Dwight, he wiped his butt. Is that close enough for you?",Yes. Of course.
10186,What?,Luke is my nephew.
10187,What's wrong with a level playing field?,Do you think they should have had open auditions for the band Hanson? What if no one named Hanson showed up? That wouldn't even make sense. Or what if they just hired the littlest kid and a 50-year-old guy who was a murderer? Really safe.
10188,Do you think they should have had open auditions for the band Hanson? What if no one named Hanson showed up? That wouldn't even make sense. Or what if they just hired the littlest kid and a 50-year-old guy who was a murderer? Really safe.,"Oh, man, so many points being made."
10189,"God, when he needed help on Earth, who did he hire? Jesus Christ, his son.",That's a really tight argument.
10190,"No! No. I'm just saying, why does God get to do something that I don't?",This is hypothetical. We're talking about Luke who happens to be terrible.
10191,"Well, then, why aren't you bugging me to fire everybody who's bad? You just want me to fire Luke. That's reverse nepotism.  He should not be punished because he is related to me and bad at what he does!","I would just like to say something off of what Darryl said about the level playing field. That is actually a zoning issue. So, thank you."
10192,"If there's nothing wrong with this, Michael, why have you been keeping it a secret?","Because I wanted you to come to me and say, 'Wow, he is so great.' And I was gonna say, 'Well, it's in the genes.' And I was actually gonna be wearing jeans. And I'd point to them, right? No. But you ruined it. So, thank you very much. Here he comes. Guys, look. I don't want you to treat him like anyone else in the office. I just want you to treat him like my nephew. Hey, there he is."
10193,"Because I wanted you to come to me and say, 'Wow, he is so great.' And I was gonna say, 'Well, it's in the genes.' And I was actually gonna be wearing jeans. And I'd point to them, right?

10194,"Wait, soy ice cream? Did you get real ice cream?",Or enough for everyone?
10195,Or enough for everyone?,"No, man. There was no list. Uh, but I got bagel chips."
10196,You really think you can make it up to me with food?,I don't know. That usually works.
10197,"Ok, you know what? Just -just back off! Back off!","Well, take a look. It's all the packages he was supposed to overnight. He never bothered to send them."
10198,"Ok, ok. You know what? This is disgusting. This is like a witch hunt. This is like the Blair Witch Hunt project.","Oh sure, those are the expense reports that corporate was waiting for yesterday."
10199,"Why is this my problem, Michael?",Because Gabe tattled. I was perfectly happy to just hide it from you.
10200,Which are?,I love him.
10201,"Oh, God. How far has it gone?",No. No. He's my nephew.
10202,"Well, I got a nephew too. But he don't work for me. You know why? Cause he's a screw-up. He can swim in my pool but he can't come in my house.","Well, this office is my pool. And my house is my house. And I just want my nephew to work in my pool."
10203,"If you keep him, Michael, I'm gonna hold you accountable for him. You're on the hook for this kid. You got that? Cover his ass like tighty-whities.",I will cover his ass like moss on a Mississippi tree stump.
10204,"Was how I put it not clear enough? I mean, you had to go and make up your own saying? Deal with it, boys.","Luke and I have been working side-by-side as master and commander. Me as master, he as commander. Occasionally he will need a little push, and I will do that, and he'll slow down, and I'll push him again. That's the thing with kids, you have to keep pushing. You have to push them until they push you back. And then you push some more. It's all about give and take, but mostly it's about pushing each other."
10205,"Yeah, yeah. Like when he presses 'Doors closed' the doors open. Or he presses 'lobby' it goes to third floor, stuff like that. Can you do that?",Yeah. Let me take a look at the circus board.
10206,"Hey, did you SMS text message me?","Yeah, I wanted to show you something in the lobby. Come on."
10207,"[as elevator doors won't shut] Okay, that's weird. Just hitting 'door closed.' What?",There we go.
10208,"Is this elevator going up? Hey, the elevator is disobeying us! [elevator stops between floors]  Okay, okay. We are stuck. We are stuck. Hank, Hank! Can you hear us? Oh, my God. Okay. Emergency protocol.",Let's just calm down.
10209,"Dwight, what are you doing!? We've only been in here for, like, two seconds!",I've got 56 ounces of fluid in my bladder! And we have to establish a pee corner!
10210,What? I'm stopping it. That's what you said.,Give me the pointer.
10211,So you just want me to move it? You're being totally unclear here. I'm just gonna go ahead and move it. [points it at Angela's chest],"No, just power it down. No, no, no, no, no. Not on Angela's boob. Come on. Come on. Luke, seriously."
10212,"Oh, my God, is it in my eyeball? I think he's burning my eye.","Michael, do something."
10213,"Okay, can I have that?",No.
10214,What the?,"That's what you're going to do, Luke!"
10215,What the hell was that?,I had to do that.
10216,All right. Are we good? [Luke runs out crying] You're okay. He's okay. There are many different schools of thought on capital punishment.,That was awesome!
10217,You follow him on Twitter?,Everywhere I look it's Betty White this and Betty White that. Finally a kid that's not talking about Betty White. Of course I follow him.
10218,"Michael, you just physically assaulted an employee. Can we talk in private?","Yes, of course. What is this in reference to?"
10219,"Yes, of course. What is this in reference to?",Pam?
10220,Pam?,"Oh, hey Jim. Some prankster switched the elevator buttons on Dwight."
10221,Do they call you that?,They do call me that.
10222,"Oh! Of course there is. Hey, Chinese tonight?",Yeah.
10223,How ya doin'?,Pretty good. You must be almost out of water.
10224,That's it? Really? That's nothing. All right. That's highway robbery.,"Good. Well, that's the spirit."
10225,"Okay. Wait, what?","Yeah, I'm really looking forward to working with you, Michael."
10226,Is there another option?,"The alternative is termination. [Michael stares off, considering termination...]"
10227,Why didn't I think of this before? Did you know that there is a daycare center opening right here in this building?,Is there really?
10228,Is there really?,"Now that I own the building, I'm looking for new sources of revenue. And a daycare center... Ha ha ha [laughing maniacally] Well I guess it's not an evil idea. It's just a regular idea. But there is no good laugh for a regular idea."
10229,Were you painting in the dark?,Wait. Is this your place Dwight?
10230,Wait. Is this your place Dwight?,Oh no. I like to think of it as a kids place. Would you like a tour?
10231,Oh no. I like to think of it as a kids place. Would you like a tour?,I don't really think we need...
10232,Who will be watching the children?,No one. The door locks from the outside. Escape is impossible.
10233,What?,"Were going to head outside, give it a whirl. I just want to see how it works."
10234,"Ok, you know what? I made a mistake. I committed corporate punishment. My bad. It's over. It's done. But my punishment is ... um ... worse than hell.","Michael has been assigned six hours of mandatory counseling with a trained professional. I actually have a degree in social work. I mean, I know a lot of people would ask a few standard questions, and check off a few boxes, but I've got a chance to do some good here."
10235,I know what you want to ask me. 'Did your mom ever see you naked?',We can do this with more privacy.
10236,"So you can molest me? Oh, ok. I don't think so. We're going to leave the blinds open so every one can see what a big failure you are. That's the key.","Boycott the Steamtown Mall! Everyone, you heard me! Cancel all of your business with the Steamtown Mall!"
10237,The mall itself or just the stores in the mall?,"All of it! The mall, the stores, the kiosks!"
10238,Did something happen Dwight?,"Yeah, something happened. Oh yeah, something happened, Jim."
10239,"[on phone] Look, I'm not going to tell you that we have lower prices. Is price something that is important to you? Ok, well let me know if anything changes.",Pam?
10240,Pam?,"I can't do this. I don't have this sales gene, or whatever it is. Tell me everything is going to be ok."
10241,Dwight?,What?
10242,What?,Did you call all of my clients at the mall and cancel all my business while using the 'F' word?
10243,Did you call all of my clients at the mall and cancel all my business while using the 'F' word?,Yes I did. And I'm going to do the same with all of your clients.
10244,"Ok, Dwight. We can't do that. So why don't you just tell us what happened?","Yeah, what happened Dwight?"
10245,"Yeah, what happened Dwight?",Ok.
10246,So what happened?,"I went to the store and I pressed the buzzer, and they looked right at me, and then they looked away. And then I pressed the buzzer again, and they started taking pictures of me on their mobile phones. I guess I'm not the kind of guy that's good enough for precious heirlooms."
10247,"You know what Dwight? You need to go back there, and you need to 'Pretty Woman' their asses.",We should start our own mall!
10248,What did I say?,"I talk a lot, so I've learned to just tune myself out."
10249,"Dwight, how about this? Instead of boycotting, you and I, together, go down to that store and we teach those snobs a lesson.","No, you and I... and I. I'm going to come with you."
10250,Did you assume that I would automatically side with the rich snobby shop owner? [removes cuff link] How about now? [removes other cuff link] How about now? [removes tie clip] How about now?,Uh... what was your favorite flavor of...
10251,What?,"One hour. We've done one hour. Let's just speed this up, ok? Keep it moving. I want to do all six hours today."
10252,"One hour. We've done one hour. Let's just speed this up, ok? Keep it moving. I want to do all six hours today.","Ok, I can't count the hour if you don't talk."
10253,"You know, do you have any idea how angry this is making me?",Tell me!
10254,"Apparently, it's one of the best revenge stories of all times, in which this sex worker, who is the antagonist... That can't be right. Andy? How does it...?","No, no. I want to hear you tell it."
10255,"Julia Roberts goes into the store, and she's like,' I was in here yesterday and you wouldn't help me.' And the shop girl goes, 'ok'. And Julia Roberts goes,' You girls work on commission, right?' And the girl is like,'Yeah', and Julia Roberts goes...",Big mistake! Huge!'
10256,"How many paper supplies and ink cartridges to go with that? Ok, sure.",Who can I speak to in this office about saving on window treatments?
10257,Who can I speak to in this office about saving on window treatments?,I don't know.
10258,Is one of you the office administrator?,[hesitates] I am. I am the office administrator!
10259,Can I show you a few samples?,"Oh, we're not interested. We're not interested at all."
10260,"Toby, can I really tell you anything?",Of course.
10261,Office Administrator. So when did this happen?,"A few months ago. I was talking to someone at corporate, who isn't there anymore, and I think the paperwork just got lost in the shuffle. Can you believe that?"
10262,"A few months ago. I was talking to someone at corporate, who isn't there anymore, and I think the paperwork just got lost in the shuffle. Can you believe that?","Yeah, totally. Well, congrats!"
10263,"Thanks! Yeah, so I'm just going to take care of things around the office and get paid a reasonable salary. You believe that, right?","Totally, that's great."
10264,"$50,000?","No, not $50,000, $41,000, I think. $41,500."
10265,Is he still doing his boycott?,"No, this is instead of the boycott. Yeah?"
10266,"No, this is instead of the boycott. Yeah?",You shirt and tie are disgusto-barfo.
10267,Really?,Maybe something not so monochromatic. Not so matching.
10268,Wait. Less matching to appear more rich?,"The glasses are a little...  [Dwight drops glasses to the floor, stomps on them]"
10269,"Wait, I see you every day. Can I say 'Good month?'",I'm telling you how to do this man.
10270,"And I was raised by wolves. I was 25 years old before I saw my first human being. Wait, is it a full moon tonight? [howls and growls like a werewolf]",Come on Michael. Those are all fake stories.
10271,"Yes, Yes. They are all fake stories. What sort of twisted mind would come up with weird stories like that? [pause] Three hours. We're half way done.",Oh.
10272,"Hey, do you have a second?",Yeah.
10273,Oh boy. Can you get every department head's signature on this so I can back this up to corporate?,Yes. Absolutely. Right away.
10274,"You know what Michael? You're right. You win. This is pointless. We're not getting anywhere. I got a bunch of fun stuff, in case my daughter ever comes over. Why don't we just run out the clock by playing games, drawing some pictures, talking?",[fanfare]
10275,So you have played it before?,I've played it once or twice with Jeff.
10276,Who's Jeff?,"Jeff was my mother's boyfriend, who she married."
10277,"So, her husband, your stepdad?","Yeah, Yeah. I guess I never thought about it that way, though."
10278,Did you guys do much stuff together?,"Yeah. You know what? He took me to a baseball game once, I remember. It was weird though. They took the pitcher out of the game. I felt really bad, because the pitcher wasn't able to play with his friends anymore. But Jeff said that the manager was making a really good move, by taking the pitcher out. He really respected the manager."
10279,"Yeah. You know what? He took me to a baseball game once, I remember. It was weird though. They took the pitcher out of the game.

He really respected the manager.",It's working. I'm doing it!
10280,What?,My place tonight. Wear this. [motioning to his new outfit]
10281,Do you have your card?,Yes. Don't forget the pipe.
10282,Its really sad that your dog ran away. Why did it keep you from going to the park?,"I was afraid I would find him in the park, playing with another kid."
10283,Why?,I guess that's why I thought he ran away in the first place. To find a kid he liked better.
10284,Right. Why would a dog do that? That's silly.,I don't know.
10285,"It's very important for you to be liked, isn't it?","Well, lets not get too... This isn't a counseling session... Ok. Son of a gun. Son of a bitch. Wow! Ok."
10286,You. Bitch. God! You're very helpful aren't you? You try to help everybody. Do you want to play another game?,I just want to...
10287,You are good. But you know what? You can't help people. You couldn't help your marriage. You lose. I don't need your help. Nobody needs your help. Nobody wants it! You can't help anybody. I don't need your help! Am I going to make you cry?,[tossing forms at Michael] Just fill them out any way you want.
10288,"So, Corporate got your evaluations, and they want me to check, is that really how you feel about Michaels situation?",Yes.
10289,Right in here?,Easily.
10290,Admit what?,I don't want to say it.
10291,Will do... Can I get one of those name plates... that says Gabe Lewis?,Sure. Anything else?
10292,Sure. Anything else?,Nope.
10293,Is that what you were here for? A crystal wizard? I like it.,It is a pewter wizard holding a crystal.
10294,"Wait a second. You know you can't buy that now, right? And I can come back and get it for you later. But I'm saying right now, we can't do that.",Because I'm here for one thing. Revenge.
10295,Yes?,"I was here yesterday, and you refused to wait on me."
10296,"You work on commission, don't you?","Stop, stop, stop."
10297,Did you just say you remember him?,"Of course, but he looks much less threatening now."
10298,What does that mean?,We had a safety concern. Um... we very politely indicated that he'd be welcome back...
10299,What?,But the blood stained hands...
10300,"You don't make a mistake on purpose, Toby! Then it is no longer a mistake... Gabe. He messed it up. He messed up the forms, I bet... [mimicking Gabe] 'I mess everything up so I can fix it and keep my job! Bah! Good thing I'm here cause I do nothing. I make everybody nervous!' [normal voice] Ah, ok. Got your notebook? Alright. Alright, lets bang this out. Let's do it to it!",Andy? [Andy starts boombox and begins singing 'The Ballad of Sweeney Todd']
10301,Andy? [Andy starts boombox and begins singing 'The Ballad of Sweeney Todd'],Yes! [as other costumed actors come in and join Andy in song]
10302,Did you write this?,No.
10303,Who did?,Steven Sondheim.
10304,Who is he? [rest of Sweeney Todd cast enters and continues singing],What the hell is happening?
10305,What the hell is happening?,We're the cast of Sweeney Todd: The Demon Barber of Fleet Street. We open in a couple weeks at the Loose Screw Playhouse here in Scranton and today just doing a wee bit of viral marketing.
10306,[cheers loudly after cast finishes singing song] That was amazing! That was awesome! I auditioned for this. When did the cast list go up?,Like a month ago.
10307,Really? They didn't call me. Who am I playing? ...Andy?,Two comps. For my lady and her Gabe. It's closing night. Tomorrow we have to give the theater over to the Scranton's Miss Fitness pageant.
10308,What? That's awful. Everyone's gonna miss that guy.,"Gabe is not coming, which is huge because my plan is to make Erin fall back in love with me tonight. Women cannot resist a man singing show tunes. It's so powerful, even a lot of men can't resist a man singing show tunes."
10309,"Oh, who else is going?",Everyone.
10310,"What kind of terrible rumor monger is Gabe? He is woefully misinformed, all right? Excuse me, clink, clink, clink, clink, everybody. You're all coming to my show tonight, right?","Andy, what time's the show?"
10311,"Andy, what time's the show?",8pm sharp.
10312,How long is it?,Hour forty-five.
10313,"Jim, Pam, you guys are in, right?","Oh, we wanted to, but our sitter just fell through. I'm really sorry."
10314,Dwight?,"Uh, no, thank you. Last time I went to the theater, a man dressed as a cat sat on my lap."
10315,"I can't Andy, it's too hard. That's-I put everything I had into that audition. Do you understand that?","If it makes you feel any better, no one who auditioned for the part of Sweeney Todd got that part. They had to bring in a ringer."
10316,This guy's like world-class. You should not feel bad. I'm asking you thespian to thespian. Will you please be the bigger man and come to my show?,"I wish I could, Andy, but I can't. I have plans that night. I'm going to see a friend in a play called Sweeney Todd. You're that friend. I'm going to see your play."
10317,"Please, waste of time. You know what? Let's just knock this out right now. Disrobe.",Angela? Don't like her anymore. Not attracted to her anymore. Just contractually obligated to make a baby with her.
10318,Angela? Don't like her anymore. Not attracted to her anymore. Just contractually obligated to make a baby with her.,Give me the punch card.
10319,"Well, there's a lot of gray area in that clause.  Do you want to re-mediate?","Alright, fine. I'll go to your little show, but I'm not wearing a cape."
10320,"Hey, how are those salads?",It's my own fault-
10321,Really?,"I mean, who knows? Maybe I have a niece my family never told me about."
10322,"I mean, who knows? Maybe I have a niece my family never told me about.","Oh my gosh, that would be amazing."
10323,You brought balloons to a play?,"I did, because I am being the bigger man, and balloons are bigger than flowers."

10325,Guys?,Hey! Andy!
10326,She's babysitting?,"I really wanted to see Andy's play, because he's so, so talented. But I've been trying to get in the babysitting game forever. The thirteen-year-olds in this town have a complete monopoly. It's almost like a babysitters club."

10333,What is the news of my darling daughter Johanna?,"[text message chime] You know what? Let me just double check, that bird... Okay, good. It's off. I mean, silenced. I silenced it by killing it. I've killed it! I'm a murderer! Just like you, Sweeney Todd. See, it all connects. Not that I know you're a murderer. My character doesn't know that yet. But I'm suspicious, because of all the razors that you have laying around. And you spend time alone. But you're a barber, so that's legit. So there's that. But..."

10339,Why are you here?,"[overlapping with Pam] Really, all you had to do was play with her for, like, 30 minutes and then put her to bed."
10340,"What possible explanation could you have for possibly being here? I don't... you know, babies shouldn't have ice cream, by the way.","I'm sorry. I just really wanted to see Andy. You guys made it sound so unmissable, and you set me up with a car seat and everything."
10341,"Oh, no, why would I take her to the hospital?",You know what? It doesn't matter. It doesn't matter.
10342,You know what? It doesn't matter. It doesn't matter.,"Why don't I just take her home and let you guys finish, and then you should stay out as late as you want."

That's broth, Gabe. Okay, I-I'll see you soup. [hangs up] Okay, I have to go. Thank you so much. This is so much fun, and I'm really sorry that I missed your play, but next time I'll be there. Or here. Right here, I promise.",Awesome.
10351,Yeah?,We could put that in orange juice.
10352,Yeah?,Let's get our juice on.
10353,"Hey, what's going on here? Post-show blues?","Yeah, I guess you could say that."
10354,"Oscar. Enough with the sass, please. God! What is wrong with you? Andy, listen to me. Look me in the eye. I thought that you were awesome.",Stop just saying that.
10355,"In the criminal justice system, the people are defended by two separate but equally important groups, the police who investigate the crimes and the district attorneys who prosecute the offenders. These are their stories. Kun-kun! [imitates vacuum cleaner] I'm just a cleaning lady. Aah! A dead body. He wrapped his belt around his own neck. It looks like a classic case of autoerotic asphyxiation. Yeah, looks like everyone's tightening their belts in this economy. [humming theme music] Last time you saw the victim, was he happy? Last time I saw this John, he was-he wasn't a victim, if you know what I'm talkin about.",Thanks you.

10361,But if he doesn't?,He'll die.

10370,How?,Michael come on. A cold sore is herpes.
10371,What?,"Wait! What you should do, Michael, is have a doctor take a look at it. Because we really don't know what that is."

Today I ended up seeing a lot of women that I used to date, and in my mind they were all great. And then when I actually saw them, it was mostly a freak show. And you and me, that must have been a real train wreck. You know what, Holly? You're wrong. You are wrong. I remember every second of us. And talking to them today, I don't feel for them anything like what I feel for you. I didn't joke with any of them, I joked with you. You are the only one who was actually happy to hear from me.

10494,But do you think it could be famous? Like in a car commercial or something?,Not really. It's kinda weird that a grown man is singing from the point of view of a little girl.

Dwight is my King up my sleeve. Phyllis is my old maid. Oscar is my queen. That's easy. Gimme a hard one. That's what Oscar said. Toby is the instruction card you throw away. Pam's a solid seven.

Hell of a ride."
10859,Why?,"Twenty minutes a day Jim, that's all it takes. Twenty minutes a day, all feet, no hands and I'll have the pedi-dexterity of a chimp, and you'll be sitting there like an idiot. [attempts to place pencil in pencil sharpener] Okay. Here we go. Ah, yes. [accidentally kicks items from his desk onto Pam's]"
10860,Do you mind?,"I'm sorry Pam, allow me to write you an apology letter."
10861,"Well, A for effort right?",[taps Jim's hand with his foot]
10862,What's the occasion?,Dwight said this entry was a waste of space.
10863,Eight dollars?,"Owning a building is a war between the landlord and the tenant. Not a literal war, unfortunately, but I am using the same tactics. I've surrounded the enemy, and I'm slowly starving them. To save on electricity I've installed a timer and motion sensors on the lights. It's part of my green initiative. And by green, I mean money."
10864,How was the dentist?,It was great. China.
10865,"Are you okay, what's wrong?","Everything here was made in China, Pam."
10866,"They used to make stuff in America, Andy. But we're falling behind, did you know that? China is a sleeping dragon that is just beginning to stir.","Oh, no."
10867,"Yeah, right here. It is right there. [holds up magazine] Anybody read the news any more?",China is on the move?
10868,China is on the move?,"I found that in the waiting room at the dentist's office. This kid had the magazine I wanted to read, that's the only one I could reach and I read it and then I read it again."
10869,"Dwight, why is the toilet paper only half a ply?","I'm sorry, isn't that good enough for your anus? Don't get me started on how coddled the modern anus is."
10870,"I'm sorry, isn't that good enough for your anus? Don't get me started on how coddled the modern anus is.","Umm, Stanley. Maybe you could just unspool a little more each time you need to..."
10871,"Are you just gonna sit there, Office Administrator, or are you going to do something?","Dwight, can we talk about these cutbacks."
10872,"You know what Pam? You're right. This isn't just a business. This is a home, and I would much rather see a smile from Kevin than save hundreds on plumbing and electricity. [Kevin smiles]",Oh my God.
10873,What?,"According to the internet, the tallest man in the world is Chinese."
10874,What's America gonna do?,I know what we're going to do. We're going to put our best minds on it.
10875,What do we do? How do we stop this?,"How do we stop it? With a big idea. That's what America is built on, big ideas. Blue jeans, the Grand Canyon. Whose got one, whose got a big idea?"
10876,"How do we stop it? With a big idea. That's what America is built on, big ideas. Blue jeans, the Grand Canyon. Whose got one, whose got a big idea?",An idea bigger than the Grand Canyon?
10877,An idea bigger than the Grand Canyon?,"Yes, indeed. Yes Kevin."
10878,Once a week antacid is the idea to beat. Anyone else? Nobody? Okay then we are... yes.,Michael! An antacid pill that you take once every six weeks.
10879,Why not just go one for the year?,I don't know.
10880,"What if we all get together and help each other and hire a new guy, and then we all kill him, but first we take out like a hundred thousand dollar life insurance policy. I bet you guys like that idea don't you?","I think that's what they're doing to me. I can't prove it, but I wanted to see their faces when I said it. I learned nothing."
10881,"No he's not right. We're not. Where would we even drop it, Phyllis? Did you know that in China there are fifty six cities with over a million people? You know how many we have here? Nine.",[gasps]
10882,"Michael, China's agrarian. Urbanizing fast? You bet 'cha, but still agrarian.","In terms of land, not population."
10883,Where are you getting this information?,I got it from NewYorkTimes.com
10884,"Uh oh, getting nervous Oscar?","Okay, someone look it up."
10885,[reads text] 'Are you watching this?' Seriously?,Well are you?
10886,Well are you?,I'm sitting right here.
10887,Great. I was wrong. I'm wrong. Is everyone happy?,So I happen to know more than the smartest guy in the office. So what? [laughs] I don't care.
10888,So I happen to know more than the smartest guy in the office. So what? [laughs] I don't care.,"Okay, now where were we before I bested Oscar?"
10889,"Okay, now where were we before I bested Oscar?","Wow, so this building can get uglier."
10890,Or else? Or else what? There's nothing you can do.,We can move out.
10891,"[lights turn off] Really? [jumps to try and activate motion sensor, Kevin walks through the door setting it off, and the lights come back on]","So, does anyone wanna know where I've been for the last 2 hours?"
10892,"So, does anyone wanna know where I've been for the last 2 hours?","Oh God, I've been playing Zombie Soccer for two hours?"
10893,"Oh God, I've been playing Zombie Soccer for two hours?",I went out to look for a better office space.
10894,Are you trying to kill me?,Is the nail place Koreans or whites?
10895,Is the nail place Koreans or whites?,Koreans.
10896,Good. And the dry cleaners?,White.
10897,I have a computer question. Hey Oscar?,What is it?
10898,What is it?,Can you move aside so that I can ask Michael?
10899,Can you move aside so that I can ask Michael?,Alright. Alright I get it.
10900,"Michael, how do I create a new tab?",Try 'Control P'.
10901,[reading text] Megan Fox. Question mark. What's that mean?,Megan Fox! Come on!
10902,You accept these terms?,"Oh, its on."
10903,"In your perfect would, what would make this building awesome? I'm putting together kind of a wish list.","Well, I wish for a million wishes."
10904,Maybe over some coffee later?,Sure.
10905,"Woah, woah, woah. Do you know what you just agreed to?",Coffee Jim.
10906,"He's trying to set you up Michael. What's going to happen is he's going to try and bring up what ever you're talking about in a very casual way, but secretly he'll be trying to trip you up, and when he does, boom, its awful. Haven't you noticed that I don't bring up the Tour de France around him?",Yes.
10907,No politics?,"I'm pretty good on politics. 'California is bankrupt, and California, California.' [Jim and Andy follow Michael into his office] What?"
10908,"I'm pretty good on politics. 'California is bankrupt, and California, California.' [Jim and Andy follow Michael into his office] What?","Parley, my office, five minutes."
10909,Parley?,"Pirate code, he wants to meet."
10910,So everyone here knows pirate code?,"I understand it, I can't speak it."
10911,You've been watering down the soap?,Why do you even need soap? Are you that bad at going to the bathroom?
10912,Why do you even need soap? Are you that bad at going to the bathroom?,We need everything back the way it was.

10918,Is it going to be worth it?,No.

10923,"So, okay. You're not a liar too are you?",I've been known to bend the truth.
10924,Yeah?,"Y'know what, I'm the only one here who you haven't asked about the new office."
10925,"Yeah, but I'm still an employee here, and that part of me is really excited about the change of scenery. What's the square footage in the new place?","Uhh, I think it's something like umm..."
10926,How many offices are there? Oh I'll just look at the one sheet myself.,"Oh, actually I don't know what I did with the one sheet. Y'know, that's the problem. You only have one sheet."
10927,"[chuckles] You're a funny guy Pam. What's the first thing you guys are gonna do when you move in to the new office? I'm going to walk down the hall and say 'Wow, I can't believe this is real, but it is.' I can't wait.",Mmhmm.
10928,It's still on a bike path though right?,There's no building... it doesn't exist.
10929,What does that mean?,"I needed leverage so I pulled those pictures off the internet. It's just this Office Administrator thing, I don't wanna..."
10930,What?,Fail. I don't want to fail... again.
10931,"Well, I'm not an artist, and I'm not a salesman. So what would you call it?","Hey, hey, hey, hey, hey."
10932,"Did you know, that China has a new missile, that can sink a US Naval Carrier nine hundred miles off the coast?",We have missiles too.
10933,What?,I wasn't here. It's a pretty common saying. You may want to log it away for future use.
10934,How then do you explain that in the past year manufacturing in China has risen by 17% and in the US it has only risen by 8%?,Do you really think that manufacturing is a relevant indicator of where the world economy's heading in 2011? Do you know the comparative expansion of say the information sector? I'd say that's far more relevant. Wouldn't you?
10935,Do you really think that manufacturing is a relevant indicator of where the world economy's heading in 2011? Do you know the comparative expansion of say the information sector? I'd say that's far more relevant. Wouldn't you?,Don't... I...
10936,Wait. You forgetting something?,What?
10937,What?,"This chat. Two men, one white, one latina. A boss and a money cruncher. I could fire you."
10938,[reads text] Come to parking lot. Crazy pigeon action?,Shhh. You're gonna scare 'em away. [two pigeons are eating out of a soft serve cone]
10939,You gotta be kidding me. Who isn't jumping?,"I'll tell you who. Darryl, Phyllis, Stanley, Angela, and Oscar."
10940,You are?,"Yes, I'm jumping."
10941,Here's a question nobody's asking: Is this worth it?,"Don't answer that. People, listen up and listen good. We need to just get one picture where we're all in the air at the same time. Yes?"
10942,"Don't answer that. People, listen up and listen good. We need to just get one picture where we're all in the air at the same time. Yes?",Why?
10943,Why?,I believe in us. We can do this. Here we go.
10944,Why's it smell real? [Pam shows him a hidden car-freshener] Ah... good one.,"Oh, ho, ho, ho! Oh, ho, ho, ho, ho, ho! Merry Christmas, little children! [dressed as Santa]"
10945,How's everybody doing today?,Good.
10946,How's the party coming along?,Great.
10947,Are we over budget?,Nope.
10948,No? Good. Did anyone get drunk already?,Not yet!
10949,"Good for you. Angela, lay it on me. What's the problem?",Nothing. Should be fun.
10950,"So Stanley, how big is the bug up your butt today?",[cheerily] Pam got those sugar-free cookies I like. I'm doing fine.
10951,"Alright. Well, I will be in my office making toys for the good children. Andy?",Yea?
10952,Yea?,Whatcha got?
10953,Whatcha got?,"All good, Santa."
10954,"Blankets, what am I, five?",Erin and I make great use of ours.
10955,"Yes, Erin and I are still dating. Why do you ask me so often if we're still dating?",I'll take one of those pink pouches.
10956,"I feel good today. My little girl Jada? It's my turn to have her for Christmas this year. Two years ago I had her, and we had the best time. I tivoed her favorite shows, some things I've never heard of. iCarly... You know who's funny on that show? The friend with the video camera. He's got a nice way of talking.","Hey, it's snowing."
10957,"[mocking] Oh, my God! It's the first snowfall of Christmas. Is that just so magical for you, little girl? Can you not wait to have a hot chocolate, and cuddle up with Papa and tell him about all your Christmas dreams, hmm? It's not even a real snow. Look, it's a dusting. Pitiful.","[Jim goes outside, makes a snowball, and brings it back inside] Hey, Dwight. [Jim throws the snowball at Dwight and everyone laughs]"
10958,"Well, it's not a snowball, 'cause it's only a dusting. Right?",Look at that. There's a pebble in there. You coulda killed me.
10959,"Yeah, who's a little girl now? [everyone laughs]",You apologize to me right now.
10960,That sounds awesome. Can we all do it?,"No, Andy, it's a snowball fight. It's not fun. Go get your own thing. Beat it. [Jim continues to shake Dwight's hand] Jim, let go. Let go."
10961,Who are you dating in the public arena?,The senator.
10962,Pam? Pam?,Pam?
10963,Pam?,"Wow, there are, there are questions to that. Okay. Um, you know what, no questions. Last item on the agenda, Toby would like to make an announcement."
10964,"Uh, because you've been on the Lam? Because the 'boring police' have been after you, and they finally caught up with you?","Uh, no, the opposite. I was actually selected to be a juror on a very high-profile case."
10965,"You know what you, you, you leave these huge pauses in your sentences. What do you expect me to do?","What's the case, Toby?"
10966,"What's the case, Toby?","Well, I really can't talk about it, but it's a very high profile case."
10967,Is it criminal?,Yes.
10968,Have we heard of it?,I don't know.
10969,Is it the middle school teacher who tried to turn her foreign exchange student into a sex slave?,Come on.
10970,Was it the post office guy who rubbed his penis all over the mail?,"Guys, it's a really big deal. [rubs his neck]"
10971,What? What?,"Yeah, uh, she'll be starting next week. If you have any questions about the transition, just let me know."
10972,"Hold on, Holly's coming back here?",Yeah.
10973,"Guys, who's Holly?","That is a great question, Erin. How do you describe somebody who is at the same time an old friend, and was a lover, and was a complicated part of my past, and maybe, just maybe a part of my future?"
10974,"That is a great question, Erin. How do you describe somebody who is at the same time an old friend, and was a lover, and was a complicated part of my past, and maybe, just maybe a part of my future?",Wow.
10975,Could he help us with some parking tickets?,I don't think that's appropriate.
10976,"We still doing the gifts today? [Pam nods] I mean, it is the Christmas party. Well, the classy Christmas party.","Yes. But don't get too excited, 'cause I didn't have a lot of time this year."
10977,"[scats awkwardly] There's nothing classier than boring Jazz music. I am here to tell ya. And I made a bit of a judgment call. I hired one musician, because I thought, what's better, to hire an entire quartet for half an hour, or one bassist for the entire day?","Hey, uh, any volunteers to come with me to go buy a Christmas tree?"
10978,"Hey, uh, any volunteers to come with me to go buy a Christmas tree?","I would, but I don't want to get dirty. There might be girls at the party."
10979,Why do you always think that girls are gonna be at the party? No one invited girls. It's just us.,"I will help. Although my 'brid', my hybrid, my Prius hybrid, won't fit a tree. Which is ironic, considering how many trees it saves on a daily basis."
10980,"Oh, do you mean Darryl? That's a great idea. I'll ask him.",You know Darryl?
10981,You know Darryl?,Yeah. He works here. We all know him.
10982,"Come on, now, Justine, look... Listen, look, I've been planning this, okay? You cannot do this, Justine.",[on the phone] I'm not doing it! She told me she wants to have Christmas here.
10983,She did?,Yes. She wants to be around family for Christmas.
10984,What the hell are you doing here? You're supposed to be in the courthouse.,"Uh, we're on recess. I came for the party. Hey, everyone."
10985,What does the strangler look like? Is he gorgeous? He looks gorgeous in the drawings.,Yeah.
10986,"Um, I was laying on the ground, defenseless, and uh, he just kept throwing 'em until he exhausted himself. And, uh, [cell phone chimes] then... [reading text message] 'How 'bout icing it? lol. Dwight.'",Hi.
10987,"Is there any way I can get a hand with these, please?","I'm really sorry, I can't help you. I'm waiting for my boss' pretty friend to arrive."
10988,"There she is. Hey. Erin, would you help her, for God's sake?","Oh, you're Holly! Of course. Sorry."
10989,"[as Curly] Why, you're some sorta wise guy, huh?",[as Curly] I most certainly am.
10990,Did you bring us anything from Nashua?,"Oh, yeah. I brought um, some maple candy. But I have to admit, I got a little hungry on the drive, and I ate some of them."
10991,Would you put those out?,"To throw out? Or put out, like, six pieces for everyone?"
10992,"To throw out? Or put out, like, six pieces for everyone?","Oh, it's so nice to be back. It looks beautiful in here. Super classy. It's like a party for limousine drivers."
10993,"Isn't it wonderful? We love it here. Don't you love it? All right, let me show you to your desk. [in a stereotyped Mexican accent] I show you to your desk.",[in the same accent] Watch out for my guns they're both loaded. [makes gun noises]
10994,What kind of guns do you have? Six-shooter?,Aww...
10995,This is weird. I can't believe you're here. This feels like you never left. Doesn't it?,"Yeah, kind of."
10996,"Well, that's understandable. Still raw. Woody your favorite character?",Mmhmm.
10997,You know who my favorite character in Toy Story is? Andy's mom.,Why?
10998,Why?,"Because without Andy's mom, there's no plot. And without any plot, there is no movie."
10999,"No. I know. I was like, 'What? Are you serious?'",What a douche bag!
11000,Really? That's creepy. How did AJ get in your house?,We live together.
11001,"Oh, you do?","He had a little note pinned to him that said, 'You've got a friend in me.'"
11002,"Hey, how about this one?","Ehh, seems a little full of itself, right? Kind of a pretty boy? What if we got a really beat up one, like on Charlie Brown. And we just loved it for what it is?"
11003,"Ehh, seems a little full of itself, right? Kind of a pretty boy? What if we got a really beat up one, like on Charlie Brown. And we just loved it for what it is?",Maybe. I mean...
11004,"Jada don't want to spend Christmas with me. She told her mom it wasn't as much fun. And how could she say that? You know, I took her to the toy store to buy her own presents.","Well Darryl, no kid wants to buy their own Christmas presents."
11005,How do I do that?,"Bring her to the party. Yeah, we'll have Santa, and we'll play games with her. It'll be a lot of fun."
11006,Why would someone hug you?,"Hey there, Jada. Nice to see you again. I'm Santa Claus. Welcome."
11007,Are you serious?,It's a sophisticated take.
11008,Who told you that?,"Nora Ephron, in every romantic comedy ever made."
11009,So is it an open relationship?,"Oh, God, no."
11010,"Well, you're almost 40. Oh, do you not want kids?","Oh, I want kids. I really want kids. But AJ and I are practically engaged. We talk about spending our lives together."
11011,So where's the ring?,"Kelly! Um, how are you adjusting to the move?"
11012,"Kelly! Um, how are you adjusting to the move?","Nobody cares about that. Look, you have to make him commit, or kick his butt to the curb."
11013,Huh? You like that?,Seriously!
11014,Huh?,Okay. Okay. [Dwight throws another snowball and laughs maniacally]
11015,"So, cool right?",There's no connection between the origin story and the quest.
11016,"Okay, well, I just sorta meant, like, cute, right?","Well, did you come here for help, or did you come here for me to tell you how great it is?"
11017,"Well, did you come here for help, or did you come here for me to tell you how great it is?","I mean, help, if it's something simple, like add page numbers or laminate it or..."
11018,"Well, it sounds like you know what you want. [Pam walks away] It's also a little derivative of a serias called 'Bear Man'. Did you look that up?",No.
11019,You know what's crazy?,What?
11020,What?,"I can't reconnect with you right now. Hold on one second. [he hurls a snowball at Dwight with a lacrosse stick, misses, and shatters a window, everyone gasps] Excuse me. [clears throat]"
11021,"What if Meredith was taking her smoking break below that window? You know what would have happened? The shards of glass would have shaved her face right off. And, yes, it might have been funny. But it also would have been incredibly tragic.",I could not agree more. And just want to state for the record that I am intending to sue Jim for acute psychological distress.
11022,What are you talking about? You're the one terrorizing me.,"With snowballs, Jim? With fluffy little snowballs? No. I thought we were just playing."
11023,"With snowballs, Jim? With fluffy little snowballs? No. I thought we were just playing.","Dwight's right. What you did was dangerous and inappropriate. I'm really surprised at you guys. Last time I was here, you were both best friends."
11024,"All this arguing reminds me of a very funny story. You see this on my desk? [he holds up a toy taxi cab] Know who gave me this? My girlfriend Tara, who lives in New York City.","Wait, what girlfriend?"
11025,"Wait, what girlfriend?",I haven't told you about her.
11026,"I'm a man in my mid-40s and I still get zits. I think that's pretty interesting. But you know what? I am not on trial here. The Scranton strangler is. So, anyway, we have this great weekend, and she drives me to the airport, and we get to JFK, but I am flying out of LaGuardia. So we laugh and laugh and laugh, and then we spend the rest of the day walking around Slo-mo, drinking latte. And at the end of the day, she gives me this, and she says, 'Michael, maybe next time, you should take a cab.'",I didn't know you had a girlfriend.
11027,Did you see her face? Well it seems to me that there is a person sitting out there in the annex that still has feelings for Michael G. Scott. And it ain't Tara.,So you went homemade this year.
11028,"Yeah. Money problems, is that what this is about? I mean, oh, dear, I don't think we can help you out.","No, no. Jim had a great year, actually. I just wanted to get your opinion."
11029,Are you good at homemade?,Look at this.
11030,"[walks in with a dirty Woody] Who did this? It's obvious to me I'm not welcome here, but somebody better tell me who did this, or else I'm leaving.","Well, I don't think Erin seems to like you."
11031,"What happened? What happened? Toby, what did you do? I think Toby's very jealous of all the attention you've been getting.","No, I would never ever do anything like that. But it does seem like something you would do."
11032,"Oh, really? Turn it on me. Well, isn't that nice? Thank you very much.","Wait, wait, guys, listen. Toy Story is all about toys that come to life when people aren't looking. You don't think... it's not possible... that Woody did this to himself."
11033,Why would anyone frame you for that?,"Okay, I'm sorry, why are we discounting this whole 'Woody came to life' thing so quickly?"
11034,"Okay, I'm sorry, why are we discounting this whole 'Woody came to life' thing so quickly?","Ahhhhhh! [laughs] Surprise! It was part of the party. Pretty funny, huh?"
11035,"Ahhhhhh! [laughs] Surprise! It was part of the party. Pretty funny, huh?",You think this is funny?
11036,You think this is funny?,[laughs] I don't. But someday I think we will laugh about this... when we tell our kids...
11037,"All right. Shh. Okay, you know what? Holly, I didn't mean to do it. It was an accident. An accident borne of jealous feelings.","Michael, you have to let this go. I'm with someone else. I don't feel that way anymore."
11038,"Oh, really? You certainly seemed jealous when I told you about my fake girlfriend. That's what Jim and Dwight thought.","Okay, hey, hey, hey..."
11039,You made up a fake girlfriend to see if I'd get jealous? And you destroyed a gift my boyfriend gave me? What is the matter with you?,"When you got transferred, and I drove you up to Nashua, you said, 'Michael, I love you, but I can't do this.' But then, with this other guy, you don't have any problem with a long-distance relationship, do you? And you know what, that is what is the matter with me."

11233,"So you work here, huh?",Sales.
11234,"Oh, man. You remember that, huh?","Oh, barely. I'm so dumb, you know, stuff goes in, stuff goes out. Not like you probably remember every paper sale you ever made. Paper salesman genius."
11235,"Where's your jetpack, Zuckerberg?",Andy. I didn't think you had it in ya.
11236,What? Come on. It's time for grapes. [regular voice] Real fun day.,"So, I won."
11237,Yes?,"So I got us a compromise. This movie's called 'Hardware'. It tells the story of a killer combat robot, just like Wall-e, that the government invented to destroy humans. It's some of what you like and some of what I like, and... married..."
11238,There's a 'Shrek' two?!,"Oh, yeah. See you tomorrow."
11239,"Everybody, can I please have your attention? Ryan and I have a huge announcement.",Oh my gosh!
11240,Divorced?,"Just so you know, it's totally amicable. We're fine. We don't need people here to take sides."
11241,Wait. Can you back up? What's the story?,"We were having a beautiful weekend in the Poconos. We were making love, constantly. We saw the sunrise. Ryan was crying a lot."
11242,What?,"Sorry, when did you get married?"
11243,"Sorry, when did you get married?","Ummm, like a week ago, we got really wasted and it just felt right."
11244,And you didn't invite any of us?,"We are getting divorced, Andy! This is such a raw time."
11245,"Ok fine, you know what, this actually isn't amicable at all and we actually do need people to take sides. Who is on my side?",And who is on my side? [no one raises their hand]

11247,Just a minute. How long do we have to wait?,For what?
11248,For what?,You broke up with AJ weeks ago.
11249,Don't you have a sales call to go on?,"I don't understand. I really don't. I mean, we know we are going to start dating. Why not now?"

11251,Why is it such a certainty that we are supposed to be together?,Why does the sun rise in the morning? Why do magnets stick together? Because everybody says so. Everybody.

11257,Say it. Where?,"Ok fine, three hints. One! When you are getting colder, you're really getting warmer."
11258,Holly is ruining Michael's life. He thinks she is so special. And she's so not. Her personality is like a 3. Her sense of humor is a 2. Her ears are like a 7and a 4. Add it all up and what do you get? 16. And he treats her like she's a perfect 40. It's nuts.,Cheer up. We made a sale.
11259,"No I'm not. I'm not in a bad mood. I'm not, Jim. Hello? Ok fine, ignore me. Have it your way. Let's just talk about you, as always. Is sex different after the baby, Jim?","Alright, let me turn on some music."

11261,Hello?,"Hi Jim, it's Helen."
11262,Hey Helen. Is everything ok?,Everything is fine. Baby's fine. She has a tiny fever. I'm taking her for a check up. Nothing to worry about.

11268,"Jim, what?","Uh, so, Cece had a little bit of a fever. And your mom also locked her in the car."
11269,Oh God! What?!,"No no no it's ok. So, Cece is with daddy now. She's laughing and she's happy. And we are on our way to see Dr. Barbra."
11270,Ok. She's ok?,"Yes, and your mom got a very well deserved day off. So here's the thing though. I left Michael at the gas station on Benet."
11271,Got it. I will put out a A.P.B. Otherwise known as a 'Ask Pam Beasley'. ... Did the phone cut off?,Nope.

11276,You know what? Why don't you stay and I'll go?,Oh no no no. I'll be fine.

11278,Which on in particular?,"Yeah, which one?"
11279,"Yeah, which one?",Well the first one has a surprise factor. 'I'm a suck suck-suckidy Sabre!'
11280,You suppose?,What's it say?
11281,What's it say?,"I'm suppose to be wearing red gloves but my color cartridge portal, got jammed again.'"
11282,You?,I've been reading the comics to my daughter since she was three years old. Not once I have used the real captions to Family Circus. That crazy family is hilarious to her for one reason: me.
11283,Which way did he go?,"Hey hey hey. Let me answer this. Stupid question. He went back to the office, obviously, which is that way."
11284,Oh really? You don't think he walked by the bakery just for the smell of it?,She's right. He went that way.
11285,[at puppies] Hey you guys. Listen to me. Don't get hung up on just one girl because there are a whole lot of other girls out there. Look over there. See? They look cute. [at parrots] Hello! You guys are so beautiful. You're so colorful. I wish I could understand you. That's a metaphor I guess. [at snake] You are disgusting. You'll never find love. Yekkk.

11288,Yeah?,Yes!
11289,Why?,Unless we can all agree to some ground rules. It's either that or I can fax this to Joe and let her decide how to proceed.
11290,Seriously?,Wow.
11291,"Ok final thing, and this is a fun one: Instead of writing the caption directly under the picture, let's all try using Sticky Quips. All right? New, from Dunder Mifflin Sabre.",Sticky Quips are fun. They are safe. They are handy. I like to use Sticky Quips as regular Post-It notes when I am in a fun mood. [laughs] Not every day.
11292,All right. What do you do with the hog dogs that you don't sell?,Throw 'em away.
11293,"Well, okay, instead of throwing them all away later, why don't you just throw one away now into my mouth?",No.

11301,Okay. I'll be right back. [goes to leave but walks back]. Okay. You know what? I'm sorry. I'm sorry. I don't have my wallet and I was gonna try to dine and dash and that was stupid and I realize I can't do that to you fine people.,So you can't pay for your food?
11302,So you can't pay for your food?,"Well I can, but I will have to come back later tonight and pay you. But the point is I did the right thing."
11303,"Okay, all right. You know what?",You were trying to steal food from us?
11304,You were trying to steal food from us?,I am not. I just have had a bad day.  And I... okay. I'll be back later with the money. I'm just gonna leave right now.

11310,"Uh, excuse me, excuse me. How does the speaker know what the guy in the coma is dreaming?","Well, if you think it's so easy, Gabe, why don't you try it?"
11311,"Well, if you think it's so easy, Gabe, why don't you try it?","Umm... 'You don't have to sniff my rear end anymore, Bob, I'm the only one here.' Ha."
11312,Tasteless?,Tasteless.
11313,"More tasteless than this...'is that a palm tree or did Gabe get skinnier? Either way, let's pee on it.'  [laughter]","Ladies and gentlemen, I think we have a winner."
11314,Who's is it? Who wrote that?,"Yeah, who wrote it?"
11315,"Yeah, who wrote it?",Please. It was easy once I decided I wanted the dog to piss on Gabe.

11353,The temp at night?,What do you...
11354,"Since when is comfort the most important thing? I mean, I don't... I don't sit on your lap because it's comfortable. I sit on your lap because I like the way your thighs feel on my butt.","Yeah, but if they're uncomfortable, it makes me uncomfortable."

11376,Erin... what are you doing?,"Guys! Guys. Did you guys know that our own Michael Scott has made a movie, and that he maybe will let us watch it, but only if everybody's dying to see it."
11377,"Okay everyone, I know we're really excited to see this movie that everybody's in, but we have to remember that Michael is sensitive, so let's stay positive! And no laughing, no comments, just positive energy and we'll have a pure fun day! Okay?",Thanks mom.
11378,He cut the part where my circuit board malfunctioned! What was the point of spilling the drink on me?,"He finished his movie? [frantically trying to open her car door, as if trying to get away from the camera crew] No kidding. Wow, that's great. Yeah that's good for him."

11385,"Uhm, I loved that you got to work together with all your friends. Isn't that great when you can all work together like that?","No, no. Holly, this isn't Ocean's Eleven, where you get together with all your friends and just have fun and don't care about how it turns out. What'd you really think, honestly."
11386,"Is it, is it because you're afraid of where this is gonna take me? See, because I need you... to keep me grounded.",Not worried about that.
11387,"[angrily] It was eleven years, okay? This has been my dream for eleven years, and if you don't think it's great than you're basically saying that you don't believe in my dream.",Wha- It's your dream and you never even mentioned it before!
11388,Well why do you have to make a movie at all?,"Because, if I don't have this, what do I have? I have nothing."

11395,"Hardy har har. Okay picture this: Snowy ash drizzles from the sky. A ravenous pack of dogs surrounds you as the flame at the end of your stick dies out. There's only one hope left for you. The door to my shelter. You pound, you beg, Dwight! Please let me in! But I ignore your cries and do not let you in. You wanna know why?","Because of the sign, that says no pounding no begging."

11418,"Ok, but listen. We just don't have the budget for it. Okay? Reception needed a computer so we got one.","Well Andy's desk needs a computer. And, I mean, it's just kinda a coincidence that I work there, but..."

11665,How do you mean?,"Black Bears can smell a salami at five miles Michael, what are you thinking?!

11743,Why am I so sad? Am I doing the wrong thing?,Absolutely not. It's just that sometimes... goodbyes are a bitch.

11746,"Got almost everybody. So... Holly's my family now. [you see video of Michael getting into the cab, and driving off. As the cab leaves, Pam drives in] She's my family.

11748,"[all are in the conference room for Michael's party. Michael isn't there. Jim gives the camera a knowing look] Well if he's not gonna make it at least we should go ahead and eat the cake. [Kevin nods] I for one love the corners. [cuts a corner piece, picks it up with his bare hands, and takes a bite] Why'd I just do that? It's not even that good. I don't even want it. I had cake for lunch. [throws the piece in the garbage] No, you know what? I've been good. I deserve this. [grabs a piece from another corner. The office groans] What am I doing?

11754,Is that what he tells you at your little inner circle meetings?,Careful.  There is no inner circle.
11755,"Jim only says that because he's in the inner circle.  I also say that because I am also in the inner circle.  Did you get that, Ma?  Your boy, Kevin Malone, is IN the inner circle!  [thinks] Which doesn't exist.",[holding two cups of coffee] There he is!  Got ya coffee.  [offers cup to Dwight]
11756,"Who's the biggest client in the state?  I say we go get 'em, whatever it takes.  Huh?  What do you guys say?",Yes!
11757,"[shoots mini basketball at hoop on office door, misses badly] Is that ball lighter than usual?  Is that a Chinatown knockoff?","That's Toys R Us, I think."
11758,"No, that's definitely a knockoff.  You can feel the center of gravity's off.  Feel that.  [throws ball to Gabe]  What do you think?","[holding ball in open palm] Oh, yeah, totally.  Jim, you got ripped off big time."
11759,[calling for the ball] Deangelo! [shoots and makes it]  See what I did there?  That's what you need to do.  [makes shooting gesture] It's that little English.  The British are coming.,Yes.
11760,What?,"I'm sorry, I'm sorry, I'm sorry..."
11761,Why should I pretend that you are my boss?,"Because what would you have done in that situation, Kelly?  I'll tell you what I would have done for you.  I'd lie for you."
11762,"Because what would you have done in that situation, Kelly?  I'll tell you what I would have done for you.  I'd lie for you.","Yeah, but you lie all the time.  You lie for no reason.  Ryan, you just like to lie."
11763,You really would?,"[hears Deangelo entering] Hey, Kelly Kapoor, if I don't have those call logs on my desk, we're just gonna have to evaluate your future at the company!"
11764,"You know what... straight up, why don't you like me?","I'm just not a suck-up like everyone else around here.  Okay?  I do my job well, so why don't you just leave me alone and let me do it.  Okay?"

11766,What?,Okay?  I'm gonna win you over.
11767,Okay?  I'm gonna win you over.,No you're not.
11768,"What's wrong with juggling, Darryl?  I'm a big juggler.  I actually perform a motivational juggling routine.",Seriously?
11769,Seriously?,"Oh yeah.  I'd do it for you here, but uh, what would you say this room is, 300 square feet?  320?"
11770,"Oh yeah.  I'd do it for you here, but uh, what would you say this room is, 300 square feet?  320?",320.  Just freeballin' it.
11771,"It's a little cramped.  How many square feet out there?  17, 18 hundo?","Oh, I think it's 18 hundo."
11772,"Oh no, do you think it was stolen?","I gotcha covered, boss.  Used to play with the parabolas myself. [opens desk drawer and takes out balls]  Got some extra balls!  [throws them toward Deangelo, who dodges them]  Hey-hey-hey-ho!"
11773,"Sorry, I never touch another juggler's instruments.  You know, we're all here, I've got the music cued, why don't I just do my routine without the juggling balls? [starts to play 'Wake Me Up Inside' by Evanescence] Prepare... to go into the danger zone.  [begins pretend juggling routine]","Oh wow, you weren't kidding."
11774,"No.  Never.  Can someone please throw me a fifth ball?  If you dare!  [Kevin pretends to throw ball]  Incoming!  And we're on!  Remember, nothing's impossible!  Phyllis, where's Phyllis?",[raises hand] Here.
11775,"Do you believe in me, Phyllis?",Yeah.
11776,"[pretending to bounce balls off Phyllis at close range]  Feel that connection?  Don't move your head.  Please.  Thank you.  Oh!  Big hand for Phyllis!  [clapping]  That took a lot of guts!  [finishes routine]  Ho!  I'm Deangelo Vickers, thank you so much, hope you learned something.",Didn't drop a single ball!
11777,What could he possibly stand to gain from a fake juggling routine?,What could he possibly stand to gain from a real juggling routine?  How can you keep defending him?
11778,What could he possibly stand to gain from a real juggling routine?  How can you keep defending him?,He's good at his job.  And I like working for him.
11779,"Okay.  Then how about I'm the head of the Accounting Department, but he only ever talks to Kevin?  What about Pam and Kelly?  Also department heads.  But has he ever met with you or even asked you to do anything?",How could I not see it?  You're so right.
11780,How could I not see it?  You're so right.,[to Jim] Why don't you talk to him about it?
11781,[to Jim] Why don't you talk to him about it?,"And say what?  'Hey Deangelo, are you shy or just a sexist?'"
11782,"And say what?  'Hey Deangelo, are you shy or just a sexist?'",Why don't you just tell him how his actions are being perceived by the women in this office?
11783,Why don't you just tell him how his actions are being perceived by the women in this office?,Mmm-hmm.
11784,"And if he doesn't listen, then he can kiss his penis goodbye.  Snip snip.  Am I right, girls?","Hey, you got a second?"
11785,"Hey, you got a second?","Yeah, I got tons of time.  This job's a joke."
11786,So what's up?,"Umm, really, it's nothing, I was just talking to Angela, and she was --"
11787,"[opening door to Deangelo's office] Hey, saw Jim come in.  We meeting?","Yeah sure.  Let's make it a meeting. [Darryl, Kevin, Gabe enter office]"
11788,"What's the big secret?  Why are you even whispering?  Come on, it's the guys!","I know. [Gabe and Darryl stand on either side of Jim with paper and pens in hand]  Just the guys.  Well, maybe that's, uh, part of the problem.  I think...so what happened was, I was talking with some of the department heads.  Uh, some of the female department heads."
11789,Uh-oh.  Right?,Hot!
11790,Are you serious?  Who feels this way?,Oh.  Like nobody.
11791,"Umm, Pam?",It was --
11792,Was it Pam?,"That sounds like Pam.  You know how she gets.  Deangelo, she can get really bitchy.  [begins bad imitation of Pam] Kevin..."
11793,"Guys.  Hold on.  Doesn't matter who, okay?  I'm just happy that Jim brought it to my attention because honestly, I had - I had no idea.",That's awesome.
11794,"Erin, do you mind running down to the lobby and bringing up my brand new executive assistant?",Absolutely.
11795,"Hey, who'd you end up hiring?","Oh, I'm glad you asked, Jim.  Because apparently there's a rumor running around here that I am a sexist.  I can't work here effectively if you guys think I'm something that I am not.  I am not a sexist.  Raise your hand if you have a vagina.  [Deangelo raises hand, Kelly and Pam sheepishly raise hands] Raise your hand if someone you love has a vagina.  [Deangelo raises other hand, along with rest of office] Yeah, yeah.  Okay.  Just about everyone.  What about Deangelo's hand?  Oh wow.  He's got 'em both up.  [Ryan raises both hands]  Yeah.  Uh huh.  [others raise both hands] Yeah, so it bothers me when I hear that there's gossip around here that I treat women lesser than men.  Okay?  Frankly, we all look a little ridiculous when that happens."
11796,"Oh, I'm glad you asked, Jim.  Because apparently there's a rumor running around here that I am a sexist.  I can't work here effectively if you guys think I'm something that I am not.

Frankly, we all look a little ridiculous when that happens.","I'm not a feminist, but I think that the men in this office are being given chances that the women aren't."
11797,"Dwight, what's your take?","What's the argument here?  NBA, WNBA.  One is a sport, one is a joke.  I love sports, I love jokes.  Room for all."
11798,"What's the argument here?  NBA, WNBA.  One is a sport, one is a joke.  I love sports, I love jokes.  Room for all.","Man, you're smart.  [Erin arrives with new executive assistant]  Oh, hey!  Hi!  Hello.  Welcome.  Uh, everyone, I'd like you to please welcome Jordan Garfield.  This is everyone."
11799,"So, Jordan, uh, where did you work before?  Uh, a law office?","No, Anthropology.  We don't have this in that size, pretty lame."
11800,Lame?  You worked at Anthropology?,Yeah.
11801,That's like my dream job.  How did you even get that job?,"Well, I umm -"
11802,You chose this job over that job?,"Okay, okay, back to work, Kelly, we have a lot to get done today."
11803,"So, umm, is this your first office job then?",Yeah.
11804,"[heading into Deangelo's office] Jim, you coming?","Oh yeah, did he text us?"
11805,"Oh yeah, did he text us?",Yeah. [Jim looks at cell phone as Dwight's phone vibrates]
11806,"Jim, what are you doing?  Get in there.  This is not the time to take a stand.  At least he likes one of us.",He didn't text me.  [Andy's phone chimes]
11807,"Andy, what are you doing?","I'm going in, into the belly of the beast.  Gonna infiltrate and change from within.  [joins the group in Deangelo's office]  What's up, mancave! [makes barking noises]"
11808,"Internally, for office use [Jim quietly enters Deangelo's office and sits down] where do we get our paper from?  Do we go -","[to Jordan] Don't worry, the first day's always the hardest."
11809,Can I help you?,Nope.  Just... [Deangelo continues staring at him] Okay. [gets up and leaves office]
11810,"So, he kicked you out of the inner circle, huh?","Well, there is no inner...circle."
11811,Dwight?  Deangelo wanted me to ask you if there's anything I can help you with.,Really?  Anything.
11812,Really?  Anything.,Do you need anything?
11813,Do you need anything?,"Deangelo, tell your whore to leave me alone."
11814,"Hey!  Kelly, that's the last time I'm gonna talk to you about your paycheck!  Okay?  We pay you a fair salary here, and if you're only here for the money, maybe you shouldn't be here at all.",No one likes a money grubber.
11815,"I'm sorry, Mr. Howard, I apologize for grubbing for money.  I can't do this.  I can't do this.  I'm sorry.  I just can't do it.  Deangelo, Ryan is not my boss.  Okay?  Frankly, he hasn't had a real job here in years.",Ohh.
11816,"Is this true, Ryan?",I did not see Rango.
11817,"[knocking on door to Deangelo's office as loud yelling comes from inside it] Hey!  It sounds like you guys are having a lot of fun, but it's really loud, and some of us are trying to work, so do you think you could do it a little more quietly?","Well, that's gonna be tough, because we're getting a dunking clinic from Magic Jordan himself."
11818,"[chuckles] Oh, you mean Michael Jordan?",[laughs] Total brain burp.
11819,"You know what?  Instead of a game, why don't we do an exhibition?  I'd love to see that dunk of yours.","Yeah, we'll set that up one day."
11820,Why not?,Only because no one has called NASA to request a liftoff. [laughter] Let's go downstairs!  Okay?  Let's do it.
11821,Only because no one has called NASA to request a liftoff. [laughter] Let's go downstairs!  Okay?  Let's do it.,"Pass.  If I wanted to see a pissing contest, I'd lock Mose in the chicken coop."
11822,"Seems a little close, you sure that's the real foul line?","15 feet from the baseline, so, you need me to move it in?"
11823,"15 feet from the baseline, so, you need me to move it in?","Nah, that's 15.  Yeah."
11824,"And uh, you know what, to make it interesting, Jordan, why don't you sit underneath the basket?",Seriously?
11825,Seriously?,"Yeah, come on.  I'll dunk over you.  Best seat in the house."
11826,Someone want to sit in Kevin's lap?  Angela?,No.
11827,Oscar?,No thank you.
11828,Alright?,Yup.

11835,"[on phone] Well, I really appreciate the offer, but I'm just happy the way things are. Okay. Thank you. [to Pam] That was Jo, asking me if I wanted to take over as acting manager while they find a replacement. I told her... I don't want to mess this up, right? There's a consensus, people are happy.","[on phone] Dwight Schrute. Yes, I would. Thank you. [hangs up] Jordan, gather my things from my desk. [Dwight walks to the manager's office, rubs the door frame, sits at the desk reverently]"
11836,What have you done?,Mose... you'll never guess where I am right now.
11837,Do I at least get to go with you in this fantasy?,You'd slow me down.
11838,"Excellent. Morning announcements! There's been a problem with some people sharing copier codes. Your copier code is a distinct 21-digit number that is unique to you, and you only, okay? Don't share it. [Kevin looks exasperated] Jo Bennett, our CEO, will be here today for a high-level meeting involving Gabe and myself.","Ooh, about what?"
11839,"Ooh, about what?",That's on a need-to-know basis.

11841,"Oh my God, what is wrong with you?",Gotcha! Why are you late?
11842,Gotcha! Why are you late?,"It's none of your business, actually. It's very medical and personal."
11843,"I know, right?","Hey, Andy?"

11846,Can I talk to you a second about these client memos?,Sure. What's going on? [in room with Gabe]
11847,Sure. What's going on? [in room with Gabe],Are you still in love with Erin?
11848,Are you still in love with Erin?,What?
11849,What?,"Because I am. I need to get her back. [crying] I can't be alone anymore. Andy, do you like being alone with me right now?"
11850,"Because I am. I need to get her back. [crying] I can't be alone anymore. Andy, do you like being alone with me right now?","No, this is horrifying."
11851,"No. I don't like being alone with me either, okay? I have to get her back. Are you still gonna date her?","We're just friends, okay?"
11852,"We're just friends, okay?",Do you promise that?
11853,Do you promise that?,"Yeah, fine, I promise. We'll never date again. Can we go outside now?"
11854,"Yeah, fine, I promise. We'll never date again. Can we go outside now?","No, just give me a second. I don't want anyone to know I've been crying."
11855,"[seeing the Join the Fist flyers that Jim is hanging] Hey, hey, hey, hey. What do you think you're doing? What's this? What's the Fist?","Oh, it's just a social club. You know, like the French Revolution, or the Black Panthers, or communism. It's just a club. Guys talking, you know."
11856,You expect me to believe that you're starting a rebellion?,"Nope. Social club. God, I hate when everybody calls us a rebellion. [Darryl enters and brandishes his fist, Jim returns the gesture]"
11857,"Okay, you know what? I would love to join The Fist.","And we would love to have you. But not today. Unfortunately, it's a bad day, what with Operation Overthrow and everything, but I have noted it.  [Dwight tears the sign down, Jim hangs two signs in its place]"

11859,You mean the frozen mice for the piranha?,No. The blueberry Slurpee pouch.
11860,"Erin, I am in love with you. I don't believe in much, okay? I don't believe in horoscopes. I don't believe in Christmas. Uh, uh, I sure as hell don't believe in God. [Erin and Angela both look taken aback]",[quietly] What?
11861,[quietly] What?,"Or maybe there's a God. I don't know. I mean, it's just not a guy with a long white beard. [Erin looks shocked] Or it could be. I mean, it's possible that that is exactly what - what God is. But for all of the disbelief [phone rings] I believe in us. I believe in love. You have made me believe that for all of the hokum [phone continues ringing] out... there... uh, do we not have voicemail?"

11864,What?,"If I had thought that there was a real chance that Dwight would be permanent manager, I would have pre-quit. And you might be saying to yourself, 'Well that's pretty premature to think,' but I always say, it's better to be pre-pre-preprepared."
11865,"How you doing, Jordan?",I'm good.
11866,Why are you telling me this?,"Now I want you to find out what people are saying about me, things they don't want me to know abou-[Dwight opens a box and sits down in shock] Ohh... it's a holster."
11867,"Dwight, are you carrying a gun?","The holster was a gift from my great-uncle Honk. Um, I don't know. I guess he's saying that he's proud of me."
11868,"The gun is just an accessory to the holster, okay? I can't walk around wearing an empty holster.",Why do you need to wear the holster at all?
11869,Why do you need to wear the holster at all?,Why do you need to keep wearing those booby shirts all the time?
11870,Why do you need to keep wearing those booby shirts all the time?,Thank you.
11871,Why would I put a banana in my holster?,"In case you weren't hungry now, but you got hungry later."
11872,"Dwight, no gun, okay? Don't make us call Jo.","Okay. All right. Fine. Everyone calm down. Someone get me a banana. Sorry I freaked you guys out - aah! [Dwight goes to flip the gun and it fires near Andy's ear, making everyone jump]"
11873,My God. There is a hardwood floor underneath this carpeting. Why would they do that?,[trying to find a pitch] Eeeeeeee... There's like this crazy ringing going on. I can't - eeeeeee... I can't find perfect C.

11876,"Okay, why are you calling Jo?",I think I should go the hospital.
11877,What's wrong with you?,It's my ear.
11878,Really? You did? What hand was I holding the gun in? What did Andy's tie look like?,Navy blue. Little red anchors.
11879,I am supposed to collect eyewitness accounts. Who saw Dwight do this? [all raise their hands],"Okay, really?"
11880,"Okay, really?",Would you consider this a terrorist incident?
11881,Would you consider this a terrorist incident?,I felt terrorized.
11882,"Dwight, why is it on us to protect you?","Because you guys are my best friends, and I mean that. Managing you for this last week has been the greatest honor of my life. And if you ruin this, I will burn this office to the ground. And I mean that figuratively. Not literally. Because you guys are so... so important... to me. I love you guys. But don't cross me. But you're the best."
11883,"There he is! Our hero! [Both Dwight and Erin move to hug Andy] You look fantastic. How you doing? Here, tell us your war stories.","Well, I burst my eardrum. Doctor said it could take weeks to heal."
11884,Did they say what caused it? Because I know you like putting Q-tips deep into your ear canal.,Yeah.
11885,How's your hearing?,Temporary deafness in one ear. It was both ears. I couldn't hear a thing Darryl was saying while we were in the waiting room.
11886,American Idol? What? No.,Okay. I guess I can just not go. Do you guys wanna hear my solo?
11887,Okay. I guess I can just not go. Do you guys wanna hear my solo?,No.
11888,[singing] Why did my temporary boss go on a shooting spree?,"Okay, fine. You can go on your singing audition."

11893,"Hello, Jo. Welcome. Well, shall we begin?",Slow yourself down there. Just like a man. Wants to jump right into it while I still got my socks on. Jim Halpert - the only man that ever turned me down.
11894,"Well, I don't know about that. Just wasn't for me. But let me assure you, Dwight is firing on all cylinders. Right?","Well, some pretty big shoes to fill. I was sorry to hear about Deangelo. He was a good man. Tragic. [Jim coughs]"
11895,"[does jazz hands, Jo notices and eyes him oddly] Well, what can you do? Life.",We have to clean this up now!
11896,"Hey, Andy, did you tell Erin about our conversation earlier when you said you would never want to date her again?",Uh...
11897,"Did I say that earlier? Yes, I did. Because you, Gabe, were crying...","No, I was not."
11898,And sobbing uncontrollably. Yes. Uh-huh. You were in hysterics. And my maternal instincts kicked in. Is it actually how I feel? Yes. Or no. That is... between me and my diary.,"Oscar, can you print out last year's sale statements?"
11899,"Oscar, can you print out last year's sale statements?","Hey, Dwight, gimme a back massage."
11900,"You're kidding me. [reaches under Kevin's jacket] Oh God, what am I touching? It's moist.",I don't feel anything.
11901,"Okay, how's that?",Knead it. Knead it like a pizza.
11902,"Dwight! Walk me out. Let's talk soon. And stay on top of these people. You gotta admit it - it's nice to have a little power, eh? How's it feel?",Jo... I accidentally fired a gun in the office today.
11903,What?!,"I am telling you this because I care too much about this job to be blackmailed into doing it poorly. All I've ever wanted was to be manager here. And if you feel that you cannot promote me over this one accident, I understand. But if you think that extortion is worse -"
11904,Shooting is worse! Are you kidding me? It's not even in the same - you shot a gun? What is wrong with you?,"It was a Beaumont-Adams, if that helps."
11905,Who else would be responsible?,Pam made me put a banana in my holster.
11906,Okay. Did I make a mistake? Yes. Do I regret the decision that I made? Yes.,"Oh, stop asking yourself easy questions so you can look like a genius."
11907,You three are my search committee. You're in charge of finding me my next manager. All righty?,Yep.
11908,"Till then, we need a new acting manager. Now, who's got the most experience in this office?","Uh, well, we probably don't want to go just on seniority."
11909,Who is it?,"Hey, Dwight. What's up?"
11910,"Hey, Dwight. What's up?",Shut up.
11911,"Well, you do know that Jo was right to take the job away from you, right? There's no debating that. But, I will say... in your one week, every single one of the orders went out on time. And I think that is shagadelic, baby. [Dwight sees Creed claiming the desk in the manager's office]","[giving Kevin numbers for the copier] Four, one, seven, one..."
11912,Another one?,Yes!
11913,Could you turn the volume down on the beeping?,"Six, nine, shut up, Oscar. Eight..."
11914,Do I love being manager?... I love my kids. I love real estate. [slowly getting more excited] I love ceramics. I love my job. I-I love wrestling.,[to Jordan] Find out what language this is. [speaking in strange language]

11916,What are we doing?,We're making acronyms. Okay! What does the first 'B' stand for?
11917,We're making acronyms. Okay! What does the first 'B' stand for?,Um... Business!
11918,[conducting interview] Your paper experience is very interesting. Do you think you could use that experience to inform decisions here?,"Absolutely--I, yes. In fact, I actually have a three-step plan that I believe could effectively double your profits."
11919,Really?,Yeah.
11920,[waiting for Fred to continue] ...What is it?,Nice try.
11921,"I'm sorry, what is your three-step plan?","Well, I mean, I can't just hand you my plan. I mean, if you guys give me the job, then, then you'll get the plan."
11922,"[speaking faster] Well, I'm not gonna just make up that I have a plan. I got a plan. Believe me, you guys want it. You're in paper, right?","How would we know that, if you don't..."
11923,"I guess I could be, if I was... who would do that?","How about this. Why don't you give us a part of the plan, and that way we know you have it."
11924,[confused] W-What?,That's a verbal trademark. That's an agreement.
11925,"We are the Search Committee, hand-picked by our CEO, and tasked to find this branch's new manager. Not everyone we meet will be good, but someone's bound to be, right? [Andy, Kelly, and Darryl are each dressed up in suits for their interviews, Andy is also wearing an 'Andy for Manager?' pin on his jacket] And, to be honest, I think a lot of the decent candidates are right here in-house, so, I'm not too worried. But I'm really excited to spend a lot of time with Toby and Gabe. [quietly] Did you know that Gabe's last name was Lewis? I had no idea.","[in elevator with Phyllis and Darryl, all three are smiling, to Darryl] Good morning."
11926,Did you have a nice drive in?,I did.
11927,"The manager job? Nah, I'm barely interested. I just can't not go for it. You know, it's not the Bernard way. We give it the old college try, and then, in defeat, we show grace.","Still, I'd really like to see this office with you in the boss's chair."
11928,[checks to see that she is alone with Phyllis] Did you hear anything?,"Oh, I'm sure they'll let us know when they get the results. [Erin crosses fingers and smiles excitedly]"
11929,"[to Dwight, who is reading the want ads] Should you really be so blatant about that?","They won't make me manager, and I won't settle for anything less. I've gone about as far as I can here. That's obvious. Time to take my talents elsewhere."
11930,Are you really going to apply for work at Scranton Breadworks?,Bread is the paper of the food industry. You write your sandwich on it.
11931,Can you do any better on salary?,"Unfortunately, that range is set at corporate."
11932,"What about mileage when I use my car? I mean, gas ain't cheap, you know.",Heh. We think that 25 cents a mile is pretty generous.
11933,"How about 27? And uh, when I make long-distance calls, will they be monitored or is it on the honor system?","[on phone] Okay. [hangs up, smiling] How odd, a very unusual phone call from the Senator's office. The Senator wants me to have lunch with him at The Botanical Gardens."
11934,How will your experience selling refinery equipment translate to our smaller scale here?,"You don't work in sales, do you."
11935,"You see, I sit across from a man. I see his face. I see his eyes. Now, does it matter if he wants a hundred dollars of paper or a hundred million dollars of deep-sea drilling equipment? Don't be a fool. He wants respect. He wants love. He wants to be younger. He wants to be attractive. There is no such thing as a product. Don't ever think there is. There is only... sex. Everything... is sex. You understand that what I'm telling you is a universal truth,... Toby.",Yes.
11936,"Okay, I-I am, I'm almost a little concerned that you might be overqualified for the position. [Robert and Gabe chuckle at this, then Gabe stops chuckling] Do you, um, do you think that you are?",Do I look like someone who would waste my own time?
11937,Do I look like someone who would waste my own time?,No. [Robert then nods his head at Jim]
11938,"Can you... [seems intimidated, clears throat] You are a man of great confidence. Could you speak a little more to that, and, what the role of confidence... would be... in a dialogue with a subordinate?","Will you be heard? Will you have a voice? Will I steamroll over you? Do you feel heard right now, Jim? Do you have a voice, right now? You can answer me."
11939,"Will you be heard? Will you have a voice? Will I steamroll over you? Do you feel heard right now, Jim? Do you have a voice, right now? You can answer me.",Yes.
11940,"That was your choice, not mine. The fallacy is that it is up to the steamroller. It is up to the object... whether it will be flattened or not, and I can tell from the small interaction we've had already, you won't be flattened by anybody. Do you agree with me, Jim?",Yes.
11941,"Think about it! What other mammal, besides humans, drinks the milk of another mammal? I mean, you don't see a bear drinking raccoon milk.","[Jim and Gabe laugh, Toby smiles and nods] Oh."
11942,Oh? Uh... we haven't started the interview yet. Were you--were you joking?,Uh... [looks at camera] yes?! I was. [sits back down] Little joke!
11943,Uh... [looks at camera] yes?! I was. [sits back down] Little joke!,"So, how would you go about settling interpersonal conflicts within the office?"
11944,"So, how would you go about settling interpersonal conflicts within the office?",I thought that was your job.
11945,"Well, for instance, how did you deal with it when two warehouse guys got into a fight?","I'll answer that, Jim. I would use it as an opportunity to teach, uh, about actions... and consequences... of actions. [Jim and Gabe stare at Darryl]"
11946,[noticing Erin in the background leading a black man dressed in a suit through the office] Who's that?,"[ignoring Darryl's question] So I think all we need is a resume, and we'll be good right?"
11947,"[ignoring Darryl's question] So I think all we need is a resume, and we'll be good right?",I... I just thought you knew me.
11948,"Yeah, it's no big deal, just something that looks like that. [shows Darryl a resume] Cool? [goes to put the resume away]","Let me... [Jim shows him the resume again, Darryl looks at it a little longer this time] Oh. Cool. [Jim gives Darryl a thumbs-up, then looks at the camera as Darryl gets up to leave]"
11949,"[at the cafe on the first floor] Did, uh, you just interview?","Ohh, unfortunately, yes."
11950,What do you mean?,"That business can't attract anyone. It's awful up there. Those people seem like they're in prison, waiting out life sentences in a... dying industry."
11951,What makes you feel qualified to judge a place after a mere interview? [Robert stares at Dwight] What are you doing..? [Dwight sits up abruptly] Stop trying to figure me out.,I just did.
11952,Stop trying to figure me out. [Robert turns to ignore Dwight] Do you even know anything about paper? How it's made?,I saw an episode of how they make paper on Sesame Street. [nods at Dwight mockingly]
11953,"I'm gonna prevent inferior men from sullying my place of work with their weak, passionless leadership. Do you see my hat? No? That's because I just threw it in the ring.","You guys pay for relocation, though, right?"
11954,"You guys pay for relocation, though, right?","Well, why would you need relocation, if you already live in Scranton?"
11955,"Well, why would you need relocation, if you already live in Scranton?","Well, I'd want to move further away, you know? Just... I don't want any chance to run into my co-workers outside the office."
11956,"Well, I'd want to move further away, you know? Just... I don't want any chance to run into my co-workers outside the office.",Can I ask why you're leaving your current job?
11957,Can I ask why you're leaving your current job?,"[pulls out a tupperware from his briefcase and takes out a tupperware] I'm leaving my other job because they were all jerks, really. [opens tupperware] You know, all of 'em. You had your jerk-wads, and your jerk-offs, so, just between the wads and the offs, I just... I had to get outta there. [begins eating sandwich]"
11958,Is this a bad time to be doing this?,I'm having a bad time. [chuckles]
11959,"Oh, why did I believe that weirdo in the lobby? These are the nicest people I ever met.",[limo driver lets Angela out of the limo at the office parking lot] Thank you.
11960,"It's a little flashy. I mean, what am I? Naomi Judd?",Tell us the freaking story!
11961,"Okay. He took me to the replica of Monet's Japanese bridge, and then he put this flower behind my ear, which normally, I would hate, 'cause it's so civil rightsy. Then he got down on one knee, and he said, will you be a Senator's wife?",[laughing] Oh-ho-ho! He talked about himself in the third person?
11962,[laughing] Oh-ho-ho! He talked about himself in the third person?,"Yes, Pam. Not everyone is as informal as you and Jim. [imitating Jim's voice] Oh, hey Pam, dude, whatever, wanna marry me? [Erin, Kelly, and Meredith laugh]"
11963,"Yes, Pam. Not everyone is as informal as you and Jim. [imitating Jim's voice] Oh, hey Pam, dude, whatever, wanna marry me? [Erin, Kelly, and Meredith laugh]",That's not accurate.
11964,Andy? You all set?,"Okay, guys, it's time. It's pep talk time. Tell me what I need to hear."
11965,Are you sure this is a good idea? I hate to see you disappointed.,[grunts] Augh.
11966,"So, Andy, what improvements would you make as office manager?","For starters, I really think we can streamline communication around here... [gets cut off by Gabe]"
11967,How many windows are there in New York City?,What?
11968,What?,"Critical thinking. Common, on-the-spot question asked in an interview."
11969,Okay. Let me think... are you counting car windows?,No... How far away is the Sun?
11970,No... How far away is the Sun?,"[happily] Uh, 93 million miles."
11971,[to Gabe] Is it?,"Yeah! And the diameter of the Sun is 870,000 miles, which makes it 109 times wider than the Earth, and... [Gabe looks visibily annoyed] 333,000 times heavier than the Earth,..."
11972,"[on phone] Yes, there used to be a paper clip that would pop up and say 'Looks like you are writing a letter or resume. Would you like help? I believe his name was... [looks embarrassed at camera] Clippy.","[on phone] First of all, I want to thank you for your years of patronizing our company. I've got some bad news. We're going out of business. [covers phone, whispers to Pam] Saving face. [uncovers phone] Yep, yep. I understand that. Basically everything is falling apart here. Pam looks around the office and realizes only she has overheard this]"
11973,How is this on me?,Hang up. [Creed hangs up] Corporate needs you to find the differences between this picture and this picture. [shows Creed two similar-looking photos of some building] Intel has told us there were at least seven.
11974,"Your department's just you, right?","Yes, Jim, but I am not easy to manage."
11975,What was that?,"We just have a lot of serious candidates to get through today, so... [nods]"
11976,[getting upset] Am I not a serious candidate?,"What do you want me to say? I mean, there's a line of qualified people out there. We have a video CV from England. [to Jim and Toby] Are we all just gonna pretend to-- okay. [to Kelly] Um, what are your weaknesses?"
11977,"What do you want me to say? I mean, there's a line of qualified people out there. We have a video CV from England. [to Jim and Toby] Are we all just gonna pretend to-- okay. [to Kelly] Um, what are your weaknesses?","I don't have any, assh***."
11978,[walking with Jim in the parking lot] How's the family?,Good!
11979,Good. They good?,Yeah.
11980,What's your daughter's name again? Peepee?,Peepa.
11981,"Peepa, how is she?",Great.
11982,"Great! Oh, that's great... We never were very good at small talk, were we, Jim?",No.
11983,"I'm going to make you an offer. Okay? You even do so little as grant me an interview, I will guarantee you your dream work life. Okay? You roll in at 10 a.m. to your own private reserved parking spot, pick up your daily free coffee from Dwight's Caffeine Corner, unlimited sex breaks for you and Pam...",Yikes.
11984,"Unfortunately, Jo also took the job away from you because she doesn't trust your judgment. So how would that look for me, if I recommended you?","Fine. I'll do it without you, but you'll regret this."
11985,"The Senator? [Oscar nods] He was married before, and he has a kid.",[whispers] So!?
11986,[whispers] So!?,And don't say that thing about how lots of gay guys have kids.
11987,Did you see him at a bathhouse?,What bathhouse?
11988,What bathhouse?,The windowless building by the Baskin Robbins.
11989,"[confused, whispers] What?",Forget it. I'm never gonna know what goes on there.
11990,"You guys, um, talking Senator?",No.
11991,No. Why would we be talking about the Senator?,Cause he's totally gay? [walks away]
11992,Cause he's totally gay? [walks away],"Um, how do I know that Robert is gay? He 'liked' my facebook photos at 3 o'clock in the morning."
11993,"Um, how do I know that Robert is gay? He 'liked' my facebook photos at 3 o'clock in the morning.","[on video resume on a laptop] Name? David Brent. Occupation? Inspirer. Status?

[Pam looks confused] Do you still have the plans for the dream wedding that you couldn't afford?",That was our dream wedding.
12045,Niagara Falls? Pregnant? That was your dream? Pork medallions?,"[looks over at Oscar, who is quietly watching this happen] I hope... you have a very beautiful wedding, Angela."
12046,"What will be your first priority? I will have seven first priorities. Safety, profits, fostering a community of self-reliance and entrepreneurship, listening, respect for human life, bolstering our public image, and... [chuckles] getting everyone home on time. Dwight, let me be frank. In an accident that no one can blame you for, an antique gun was discharged while you were acting manager. How are we ever to trust you again? [whispering] That's a great question. [Jim nods] I am going to institute a strict no-firearms policy for this office that extends to myself as well. Wow. All of my concerns are disappearing.","Thank you, Dwight."
12047,"[sighs] Very, very interesting. And you know what? I'm impressed.",He's not a real candidate.
12048,"I don't know. Dwight seems like a great leader to me, and I look forward to the personal perks that he promised me privately. What do you think, Toby?","Well, we could try him out for a little while... [Jim drops his pen, looks exasperated] and if it doesn't work out, you know, maybe one of us could, you know, step in..."

12051,"No, why would you think that?","He and Kelly said, then they pre-fired me."
12052,"Well, it's not entirely up to you, is it? Seems to me like someone's getting a little power-mad.",Am I the only one who remembers what he did when he was in charge? I feel like I'm going a little bit crazy.
12053,Am I the only one who remembers what he did when he was in charge? I feel like I'm going a little bit crazy.,Tuna... You're completely sane.
12054,"Who do you like for the job? Is there anyone who maybe was a little underwhelming at first, but now seems like a safe, if not slightly unexciting, choice?","Okay, seems like everybody has an opinion. So, who else? Anybody?"
12055,"Okay, seems like everybody has an opinion. So, who else? Anybody?",Do you mean it? Anybody? Are you sure?
12056,Do you mean it? Anybody? Are you sure?,[while sighing] I suppose I am.
12057,Okay... well what do 'I' want in a manager?... let me see. [walks slowly across the office] what do 'I' want?...,"I don't think he meant, that--"

12060,Can I say...?,Yes.

12115,"Okay, not to point out the glaringly obvious, but doesn't the fact that I'm in this group make anyone feel just a little bit better? Oh! This crust is sharp!","I used to be young and cute and sorta funny and I could do those cute, little cartoons. And everyone who came through here was like, 'Who's that receptionist? I like her.'

12122,"Hi, Robert? Can you come out here please it's really important. Just wanted to clarify something. Some people here are under the misconception that some people may be considered, uh, let's say top-tier and others would be second-tier.",I never said that.
12123,"Thank you. Great.
Robert. I said winners and losers. Is that what you're talking about?","Oh, that, it might- That might actually be what I'm thinking of. Can you clarify that?"
12124,"Oh, that, it might- That might actually be what I'm thinking of. Can you clarify that?","Let me tell you some things I find productive. Positive reinforcement. Negative reinforcement. Honesty.

12241,Why would we take the dog?,What if he jumps out the window and runs away?
12242,What if he jumps out the window and runs away?,"Jim, he's not gonna star- [Dog lunges for open window and barks]"
12243,"Oscar, what do you wanna do, this is kinda your deal. You wanna dog?",[Oscar pokes holes in cardboard now taped over window] There we go. That should do it.

12264,Where are we in the process?,"I have a file of applicants here. I just gotta open it, look at it, interview a bunch of guys,hire some of 'em. So I'd say we're in the early stages of the process."
12265,Did you go out celebrating with the guys last night?,The guys did invite me out to celebrate but I decided to just stay home. Eat a bunch of tacos in my basement.
12266,"Right. Um, well how 'bout we take a look at some applications? ...This guy wrote his in green ink, that's pretty cool. Check it out.

12287,"No. Warehouse license....Masters in warehouse sciences?...I, I feel like Darryl has talked about a license of some kind.",Is this a joke?
12288,Is this a joke?,"No. Not joking. This is real....painfully real, what is happening right now."

12296,No? OK. I don't wanna be here anymore. Fire me.,"So Darryl says to me 'fire me'. But what he really means is 'I'm gonna say something really weird, try and figure out what it means.' So I say 'No, you're not fired.' But what I really mean is 'I have no idea what your talking about, but I'm gonna go ahead and hire some people for the warehouse and hope that you eventually start feeling better.'........I really hope that's what he and I mean."

12308,You wanna make me happy? Huh?,Yeah.
12309,"Haha, what?","I'll do it better than you. I earned it. I deserve it. I got passed over, God knows why, reasons I cannot and will not understand. The job was mine Andy, everyone said it was mine. Make me manager or fire me."

12317,And did your brains tell you to ruin these boxes with grease?,"OK Darryl, listen and then you will understand. The boxes were ruined during our first trial testing so now it's cool cause we found another use for them."

12327,Why's it so far away?,"Ok, I just asked that ques-, I don't know. I mean it seems like the door is huge, right? So you should be able to back the truck up to the paper."

12407,"That Andy, so hot and cold. One day he's like, fax these documents, please. The next he's like, Pam, you fax them, who cares what Erin's feeling, right?","Oh, Erin..."
12408,"Pam, how would you rate me as a receptionist on a scale of 1 to 3?","Um, 2?"
12409,"Um, 2?","That's like, the second to last thing I wanted to hear."
12410,"No, I mean, you're doing great, and Andy put you in charge of the whole party, right?",Yeah...
12411,"[sigh] What happened, Pam?","Okay. When I was 22, I worked there and everybody said the place was haunted. I didn't believe it until one day before we opened, I look up into the mirror, you know, behind the bar, and I see this old man dressed all in black, but when I turn around, there's no one there. So, I tell the cook my story..."
12412,"Wait, they have food there?","...and he said, That's what everyone sees, that's the Man In Black."
12413,"Oh, this Man In Black thing, what do you think that was about?",What do you mean?
12414,What do you mean?,"Was it, like, trickery in the lights, or maybe you were so primed to see it, then there it was?"

12416,"Mmhmm. No, but what I'm saying is, like, do you ever wonder what it was?","It was a ghost, I told you this on, like, our first date."

12425,"You guess? So, there is something you want that you do not have.",I try not to think about it.

12431,"November's sure creeping up, ain't it? Can't stop that month!",Yeah...
12432,"Hey, what's the jive with Angela and Phyllis helping with the party, you know?","Um, I just thought you could use some help, you know, because Robert came in and thought the party seemed a little kiddie, and I guess I agreed, and maybe we could mix a little more 13 into the PG."
12433,"But that's it? There's nothing about me, or I?","Can we talk about it at the end of the day? I gotta call, gotta make a call."
12434,"Can we talk about it at the end of the day? I gotta call, gotta make a call.","Oh, yeah, sorry. Yes, we can."

12445,What are we talking about?,I was talking about my wife and how she believes in ghosts. And then we had a little debate and Meredith said she believes in them too.
12446,[to Kevin] You seem unimpressed.  Ghosts don't scare you?,I'm only scared of real things like serial killers and kidnappers.  Not things that don't exist like ghosts or mummies.
12447,[screaming] Why on Earth would a museum put a mummy in it?!?,Witch's brew?
12448,Witch's brew?,I grew this party up real fast.  Get out of here little kid party.  Nobody loves you.  And clean up your room!  Grownups are going to use it later!  Oooh!
12449,Party looks fun doesn't it?  Everybody seems to be in there having a great time.  So maybe now would be a great time for me to pop back on the computer.,I'm using it.  I'm about to play Starcraft with him [points to Dwight].
12450,[to Dwight] Are you serious?,Yeah I'm serious.
12451,Pam do you think anyone's going to notice I've worn this costume before?  When I wasn't pregnant.  You know I bet nobody would believe it still fits.,Hey guys.  I'm an Oscar [gestures to face] liar [gestures to nametag saying 'Representative Weiner] weiner.

12457,Where is this from?  That is so upsetting!,That was awful.  Robert I apologize.
12458,Why didn't you simply ask Andy to clarify?  Asking is a very easy thing to do.  You're obviously very close. [Andy and Erin look awkwardly at each other and Robert].  Oh I see.  This no longer seems like my business [Robert sits].,All I know is you wanted to have a talk with me and I got nervous so
12459,Did you think I was going to fire you?  No I wasn't.  [to Robert] I'm sorry this must be really uncomfortable for you.,I'm never uncomfortable.
12460,Two dates? Three dates?,Thirty-one.
12461,Jim doesn't let me wash his NFL jersey during the playoffs. How is this any less logical?,"Careful, whoa. First of all, it's not like I think that's going to help the Eagles win."

12463,"You wanna attack or let them come to us? Your call, B.",Unleash the hellstorm.
12464,Is she Asian?,"I don't know. She's from somewhere, I bet. Maybe from the forest."

12466,"Looks terribly real, doesn't it, Creed?",No...
12467,Are you scared of snakes?,"You don't live as long as I have without a healthy fear of snakes, Bobby."
12468,[to camera] What am I up to?,"Like, a few years down the road, Cece says, 'Mom, there's a ghost in my closet.' Now, you say one of two things - one, 'You're just having a bad dream,' or two, 'Let's go see what it was.'"
12469,"Almost instinctively, she turned to her husband. 'Oh, wait,' she thought, 'I don't have a husband.' For Lydia and her husband had had an argument, one they couldn't get past. Each night, they slept one inch farther apart, until one night, Lydia left. It was about this time she lost herself in imaginary worlds. She had quit the book club, the choir, citing something about their high expectations. Her lips slowly grew together from disuse. Everytime she wanted to act and didn't, another part of her face hardened, until it was stone. And that fevered night, she rushed to the nursery, threw open the door, 'Baby, are you okay?' Baby sat up slowly, turned to mother and said, 'I'm fine, b!tch, I'm fine.'",[laughs]
12470,Toby?,"Oh, hey, Bert. Wanna see the dance? Dem bones, dem bones, dem dry..."

12475,Have you seen a ghost?,Seen and banged.
12476,"Ok, I met him in a bar, right? There's something weird about him. He doesn't smell right, the clothes are all tattered and dirty and from another age. Anyways, we end up back and my place and we go at it all night-","Meredith, don't."
12477,Have you considered the possibility that you slept with a drifter?,He didn't smell like a drifter.
12478,What are you anyway?,"I'm a Jamaican zombie woman. Leave me alone, ghoul."

12480,Who's your favorite character?,The city of Atlanta.
12481,"If ghosts are real, how come everyone knows what they look like? It's not like a bunch of people got together and agreed on a lie.",Thank you.
12482,"Oscar, how are you on that side?",This isn't about sides. This is about me seeing a blueish gray old man in the mirror and then he vanishes.
12483,"Pam, this is important. Was he me? Am I him?","No, Creed."
12484,Whose your favorite iron chef?,[speaking at the same time as andy] This is atrocious.

12488,Is that off again?,Oh yeah.
12489,Are you really this lazy?,I'll be there.
12490,What do you got?,"[opens folder] Allow me. You're going to love this. [struggles opening folder] Ugh'should've used a shorter string. Never mind, I know it by heart. It is a system that holds people accountable for everyone else's work."
12491,Have I not been worthy of your trust? Have I not been a reliable number two?,Do not go there! You're the deuce I never want to drop.
12492,For you?,Yes. For Gabe.
12493,Who are you seeing? That's gr',Whom I'm seeing is Val from down in the warehouse.

And as a fail-safe also every negative email you've ever written about him to the group will also be forwarded to him.,What emails are you talking about?
12499,What emails are you talking about?,"Robert's favorite songs: Creep by TLC, Creep by Radio Head. You remember that one Jim? There is no way he hasn't strangled at least one stripper. Oscar. He eats his yogurt like he is punishing it for disappointing him. Kelly."

12502,"Are you sure this is a good idea? I mean the thing about this office is, we make a lot of mistakes.","But the device will change that. Without a safety net, people will improve."

12514,"You're a real crumb bum, you know that?","Hey, you can't just change the rules because you don't like the outcome. What about you, Kevin? What about you and your fake task? Can you tell me now where paper comes from?"

12594,"Dwight, am I hot right now?","Why would I or anyone else think that you're hot right now? I can't impregnate you, and that's the driving force between male-female attraction."
12595,"Why would I or anyone else think that you're hot right now? I can't impregnate you, and that's the driving force between male-female attraction.",What about before? Was I attractive before?
12596,What about before? Was I attractive before?,"Meh... you were at your most attractive when you were 24 with a slight, gradual decline and a steep drop-off when you got pregnant for the first time. Gradual recovery and, uh, well now, obviously, you're at an all-time low."

12598,None taken. What do you got?,"It is called the matchmaker test, and it is very powerful. Basically we have Pam ask Jim which of his friends he would set up with Cathy. If Jim picks a really hot friend, then we know that he thinks that Cathy's hot."

12607,"[singing] Have you heard about the midnight rambler? [Lisa, the guitarist, enters] Hey, come on in, baby. Yeah!","Hey, I was talking to Cathy. Turns out she is single."
12608,I thought it might be fun to set her up with someone. Any ideas?,"Oh, you know who might be good? Mike Tibbets."
12609,"Oh, you know who might be good? Mike Tibbets.","Mike Tibbets, really?"
12610,"Mike Tibbets, really?",Mm-hmm.
12611,"Hey, who's this Mike Tibbets guy? What kind of car does he drive?",Not his mom's car.
12612,Touche?,[sees photo of Mike Tibbets] Eww!
12613,"Yeah, but I do Pam, okay? It's called being a nice person.",I don't see what's so ugly about him. He's got the broad face of a brewer.
12614,Hmm?,"Yeah, Jim barely talks to Mike. We had to go through like two levels of friends to even find his profile. Jim picked someone just unattractive enough to shut me up without tipping it."
12615,With the crotch?,With the crotch.
12616,Who said that?,Exactly.
12617,How'd I get this long triangle?,"Okay, just shut it."
12618,Is he puffing out his chest?,I can't tell. It's unnaturally sunken. [Jim says something and Cathy laughs] Busted. He just was mirroring. Did you see that?
12619,I can't tell. It's unnaturally sunken. [Jim says something and Cathy laughs] Busted. He just was mirroring. Did you see that?,No. Maybe he just said something funny.
12620,Why's he making her laugh so much?,"Just going to walk over here- [fake trips] whoa, whoa, I'm slipping and falling! Oh, stumbling, I need something to grab on to! [grabs Jim's crotch]"
12621,Are you okay?,"I'm fine, I'm totally fine."
12622,Yes? [Jim pushes Dwight's hands away] Wha- Jim.,[to Cathy] Sorry about that.
12623,Dwight! [pushes Dwight's hands away] Why?,"I'm sorry, I fell down, Mr. Balance."
12624,"[to Pam] Does your husband have very soft erections? Because if not, I just grabbed a very soft penis for nothing.",Why was he making her laugh so much?
12625,Why was he making her laugh so much?,"Oh, hey, I'll just be a second."
12626,"[to Jim] Oh, that line from Zoolander?",Mm-hmm?
12627,Mm-hmm?,It was from a deleted scene so we were both right.
12628,[to Jim] Yeah?,You okay?
12629,You okay?,Why won't you just admit that she's attractive? It's kind of annoying that you won't say it.
12630,Why won't you just admit that she's attractive? It's kind of annoying that you won't say it.,"Okay, what can I do to make you believe me?"
12631,"Okay, what can I do to make you believe me?","Well, Dwight had this idea, and I thought it was kind of crazy. But maybe that's where we are now."
12632,"She called it crazy? Aw, man, that's insulting. All I did was propose a makeshift lie-detector test. Monitoring his blood pressure, pulse, perspiration, and breathing rate.","Yeah, its nuts. But I don't know what else to do."
12633,And she called it nuts?,"Seriously, that was hot. Feel like you and the newsman had a groove going."
12634,Did you know that Lisa toured with Chaka Khan?,Are you serious? From Star Trek?
12635,Are you serious? From Star Trek?,"[to Val] Hey, you caught some of that?"
12636,"[to Val] Hey, you caught some of that?",I caught it.
12637,"What, you don't like the blues?",I might enjoy seeing you guys play the blues.
12638,[to Pam] Really?,This could all go away if you just tell me the truth.
12639,"Uh, are you all in line?","Why don't you go check out the sympathy cards, old man? [to Jim] Now I'm going to ask you just a few simple questions. Wait for this to constrict. Here we go. Is your name Jim Halpert?"
12640,"Why don't you go check out the sympathy cards, old man? [to Jim] Now I'm going to ask you just a few simple questions. Wait for this to constrict. Here we go. Is your name Jim Halpert?",Si.
12641,"Wait, that's it? That's the question you're going to ask him?",We have to start with a baseline question to establish what the truth is.
12642,"Jim, are you serious?","Oh, you know what? This reminds me, Cece needs a new toothbrush."
12643,"Oh, you know what? This reminds me, Cece needs a new toothbrush.",Maybe we could switch instruments.
12644,"Yeah, maybe everyone move one instrument to the right?",We had to leave because of creative differences.
12645,"Do you really, Tin Man? Okay, where were we?","No, I'm not worried. Because this lie isn't for me, it's for Pam. And when she gets her body back and her confidence back... yes, I will tell her the truth. That I had feelings for a co-worker today that I haven't had in years. But in my defense, he was grabbing my crotch fairly aggressively at the time."
12646,Do you find Cathy Simms attractive?,No.
12647,"Ah, see, was that so hard?",I am not lying.
12648,Really?,"Pam, are you really gonna listen to his stupid homemade test?"
12649,"Pam, are you really gonna listen to his stupid homemade test?","I would listen to my homemade test, because your husband is definitely lying. In fact, he's lied about every question. Even his name. Who are you really?"
12650,"I would listen to my homemade test, because your husband is definitely lying. In fact, he's lied about every question. Even his name. Who are you really?","Wait, what?"
12651,"Wait, what?","Look at the numbers. Every single time, it's come up 150 over 100. Your husband is a pathological liar."
12652,Doesn't your dad have high blood pressure?,"Yeah, but I don't smoke."
12653,When was the last time you went to the doctor?,I don't know.
12654,"Dwight, stop. I'm not kidding, I mean, I need you to take care of yourself. What would we do if something happened to you?","Okay, easy. Trust me, I'm around for the long-haul."
12655,"It's not really your choice, is it? Death waits for no man.",Okay.
12656,Doesn't it worry you in the slightest that Jim is not his real name?,Just go home. It doesn't matter.
12657,"Oh, is it okay with you? Because if it's not, you work for me, so... Comply with all applicable laws, regulations, policies and contracts governing our business. Be honest, fair-",[whispers to Jim] I'm gonna do it.
12658,How do you feel?,Drive carefully!
12659,"[on the phone] What?! They took another client from us? Okay, bye. Man! Business is war! Customers, clients- it's like a war out there.",I am a leader. But you can only inspire people so much in a place like this. So today I'm turning the inspire-factor up to ten with a little help from my friend America's bloodiest battle.
12660,Why even read business books? We should be studying war. Going to places like Gettysburg. Where is that?,It's right here in PA.
12661,Gettysburg? Hmm. Could be interesting. Second-most northern battle in the Civil War.,Actually it is the northernmost.
12662,"Yeah, well, the bus has free wifi and I made special low-sugar lunches for everyone. And is anyone kosher or halal?",What's the halal option?
12663,What's the halal option?,"Dates, tabbouleh, and a bagel with cream cheese."
12664,"You know, it's the same as the kosher option. There's a lesson in there. I mean, I can't force you to go. You're not my slaves. Thanks to Gettysburg. But... who's coming with me?",I'm in.
12665,Ooh. Isn't that the one where the guy becomes limitless?,"It's just not appropri- I mean, if we were going to visit Bradley Cooper's birthplace, I'd be the first one suggesting it. I'd be rooting for it."
12666,Here. Like it?,"Oh, if you buy the picnic table then you've got to get the fire pit."
12667,"Plants and- hi, Robert! Hey, um, how are you doing? Good to see you again.",Where is everyone? Where is Andy?
12668,Where is everyone? Where is Andy?,Andy took some of the other people on a corporate retreat to Gettysburg.
12669,"Whoa, where you going?","Visitor center. Gonna grab a map for the memorials, right?"
12670,"Visitor center. Gonna grab a map for the memorials, right?","Yeah, we're not going to the visitor center. We're not tourists."
12671,"Dwight, what are you telling this girl?",The truth.
12672,"Stop filling her head with nonsense, okay? She doesn't know any better.","Oscar, I am so glad you just got here. I would've believed everything he said."
12673,"Really? Why don't you tell us the real history, Gore Vidal?","Okay, I will. I don't know who that is, but I'm gonna tell you this-"
12674,"Gettysburg was very important. Credit where credit is due, okay? Big, mad props to Gettysburg. Was it, however, the most northern battle of the civil war?","Yes, yes, yes!"
12675,"No, it was not. Was it the second-most northern?",What?
12676,What?,Sure! I will cede it was the second-most northernmost battle!
12677,"Was it the northernmost? No. Get out of here, Oscar.",Get out of here!
12678,"I am so eager to hear your game-changers. Let's dig in, shall we?",May I go first?
12679,May I go first?,Absolutely.
12680,"Raw fish- the disgusting food from Japan that Americans would never want to eat. Now, we can't get enough of it. From movie stars to construction workers, sushi is what's for dinner. Let me throw another idea at you. Origami. What? The crazy art of paper folding from, that's right, Japan. Don't you wish you could go back to 1980 and open the first sushi restaurant in Manhattan? We can do that! With... origami. It's the sushi of paper.",This idea hasn't gripped me. What else did you come up with?
12681,This idea hasn't gripped me. What else did you come up with?,"Well I had to memorize the presentation, Robert, and it took a long time to build the swan, so-"
12682,"If your woman is like mine, I bet you come home to hear the same thing all the time. This paper is so hard. It scratches. Why can't there be a paper just for me? Well now there is. 'Papyr.' Paper for women. It's pink, scented and silky soft. Now, you can watch the game and she can write a letter to her sister.","The situation you described, returning home to a wife complaining about her paper being too masculine, is not one I'm familiar with."
12683,"That's fascinating. Tell me, what's the significance of the peach orchard, thought?","Oh, well, that's a great question. Actually some of the most-"
12684,Can you tell us about the battle of Schrute Farms?,"Uh, I haven't heard of that one."
12685,"Really. Okay, follow-up question. How much are they paying you to keep your mouth shut?",I apologize for my friend and for the Republicans who are cutting your funding.
12686,[taps Gabe's shoulder] Are you Lincoln?,"No, no, I'm-"
12687,"Well, you know how in the vending machine they have the chocolate chip cookies in the A-1 spot? They do that 'cause they think A-1's the best spot for the best cookie. But the real best spot is D-4. Right? That's where the eyes go. So...",Cookies. Cookie placement.
12688,"Who else agrees with Kevin, that we're wasting facilities, manpower, on our underselling products when we should be pushing our top-performers? [everyone raises their hand, Robert laughs] There you go. Consensus.","Okay, we are now on a planet where Kevin is the most creative person around, and I am just some good-looking guy."
12689,"Kay, so another thing about oatmeal cookies. Who even wants them? I mean, I've seen Toby eat one, like, once, but other than that... [scoffs] like, forget it.",Interesting. So what is Dunder Mifflin's oatmeal cookie? What is the product that no one wants?
12690,Interesting. So what is Dunder Mifflin's oatmeal cookie? What is the product that no one wants?,how about that two-hole-punch letter? Only the lawyers want that punch at the top and they use legal.
12691,how about that two-hole-punch letter? Only the lawyers want that punch at the top and they use legal.,"That's the oatmeal cookie. Fantastic, Kevin. Fantastic. [laughs]"
12692,"By the way, did we leave all the food on the bus?",Let's talk about food for a second. Food for thought.
12693,"Hunger for chicken chimichangas. Right, Darryl?",That's good.
12694,"Exactly. Now do you know the Civil War soldiers were hungry for? Pride! Now, each battalion had its own flag and they guarded these flags with their lives. Colonel Harrison Jeffords of the Fourth Michigan Infantry saw his flag being carried away, chased it down with nothing but a sword. Fought tooth and nail at the foot of that flag until he died. He wasn't about to let them have that flag. Pride. Right, guys? [holds up flag] I commissioned this flag for Dunder Mifflin. Cost me two hundred dollars.",Only two hundred dollars?
12695,Only two hundred dollars?,"We are all branches on this tree. And from the tree comes paper. We're all part of a business. But business is war. What's that I hear? Uh, a rebel paper company is coming to take our flag! Wha- what's going on here? Wee-hoo! Come and get it! Who's gonna get the flag? Who's getting it? Whoa! Hey! Ho! Don't look where I am, look where I'm going. Juke right, juke left."
12696,"We are all branches on this tree. And from the tree comes paper. We're all part of a business. But business is war. What's that I hear? Uh, a rebel paper company is coming to take our flag! Wha- what's going on here? Wee-hoo! Come and get it! Who's gonna get the flag? Who's getting it? Whoa! Hey! Ho! Don't look where I am, look where I'm going. Juke right, juke left.","Andy, this is inappropriate. People died here, man."
12697,"Get the flag! Get the flag! Come on, Big Tuna. What you gonna do about it? We got a flag right here. Wee-hoo!",Spangler Springs is a mile this way.
12698,And why is Black Rock suddenly the paragon by which all hedge funds must now be compared?,I don't know.
12699,Really?,Yeah.
12700,Schrute Farms did you say?  That is a fascinating little chapter of the Civil War.,You've heard about it?
12701,You've heard about it?,YES!  Ha!  Prepare to be refuted!  Go on.
12702,What?!? No!,Big Mac idea.  That sounds encouraging.
12703,Well what is the idea?,Every time you buy a Big Mac you set one ingredient aside.  Then at the end of the week you have a free Big Mac.  And you love it even more because you made it with your own hands.
12704,You know what?  Now I remember.  That was your idea. [patting Kevin on the back] That is 100 percent your idea.,Oh my.  It was just actually cookies the whole time?
12705,Oh my.  It was just actually cookies the whole time?,[making pencil imprint] Dammit.
12706,You guys came.  Where's everyone else?,Back at the bus.  We were locked out.  Phyllis is sitting on the ground eating a dirty sandwich.
12707,What are you talking about?,Our office has a disease.  And it goes by many names.  Sarcasm.  Snark.  Wisecracks.  You take things people care about and you make them feel lame about it with your jokes.  That's what you did with this trip.
12708,Andy ' this whole idea of our situation being just like war?  It's just not true.  We just work at a paper company.  And you're our regional manager.  And guess what man?  You don't have to prove anything.  We like you as regional manager.  Andy if you don't believe me take a look at what's on my head.  I'm wearing a very pink hat.  I've been getting weird looks all day because I'm pretty sure 'DM does GB' means something kinda sexual.  But guess who's wearing them?  All of us.  Just for you man.  That's huge.,You don't like the hats?
12709,You don't like the hats?,They're terrible.
12710,Haha! There he is. You mind lending a hand? I'm typing up a memo to share your ideas with the board.,I can do that.
12711,Isn't Gettysburg like three hours away?,No. It's like two hours and forty-six minutes.
12712,Tuna?,Yes! Tuna of the land. Turkey. With pesto.
12713,And to drink?,Water.
12714,Where do all the cool kids go when they come to this consecrated ground?,That is what I'm showing you.
12715,"I know what you guys are all thinking right now: Hey, let's go pee on the grave of some confederate soldiers, but you know what? Joke's on you. It only makes the flowers grow back more beautifully.","Best thing you can do for the deceased is to pee on their graves. Then you dance and work the urine into the root systems. Doesn't hurt to have a smile on your face, either."
12716,"Are you sure? Yeah, it's locked.","It's not locked, gimme that..."
12717,"That's weird, if it's not locked, why isn't it opening?","It's, it's latched closed."
12718,"Ok, you know what? Andy probably has the number for this guy. I'm gonna find him.",I'll come with you.
12719,What did you say?,"Nothing, I just-"
12720,What would you say?,That it'll be the first shipment out today.
12721,"That is exactly the right thing to say! Do it! Git-er-done! Phyllis, you just married Joe Order, you're new name is Phyllis Order [fill this order], get it?",I don't get it.
12722,"Standing is proven to be healthier, increases productivity and just looks cooler. Picture someone doing something heroic. Now was he sitting or standing? Not counting FDR.",Every second you sit there is an hour off your life. Look at all of you. I feel like you're in a suicide cult.
12723,Oh yeah?,Are you really comfortable standing there? I tried one of those and I just never hit the sweet spot.
12724,Are you really comfortable standing there? I tried one of those and I just never hit the sweet spot.,"Hey guys let's just all admit it. Ok? Dwight's better than us. He had the guts to stop sitting. And he's never, ever going to go back on it right?"
12725,"Hey guys let's just all admit it. Ok? Dwight's better than us. He had the guts to stop sitting. And he's never, ever going to go back on it right?",That's right Jim.
12726,Taking a load off huh?,No. Putting a load on more like it.
12727,[sees a pole poking out Dwight's pant leg] What are you up to? Oops look out! [grabs Dwight's wallet],What are you doing? Give that back. Come on!
12728,What are you doing? Give that back. Come on!,Prank! [throws money from Dwight's wallet on the floor]
12729,You know what it's not my best. Because you could just easily bend over and pick it up right?,"I could, but I just don't feel like it loser."
12730,Because you're sitting?,Standing.
12731,Because you're sitting?,Standing.
12732,[loudly knocking on the window] In four seconds my wife is going to be coming through that door. I told her she could work here. Under no circumstances can that be allowed to happen. [to Mrs. California] There you are! Honey how on earth could you miss the elevator?,What was that?
12733,What was that?,I don't know. He wasn't talking to me. But if I were you I wouldn't hire his wife.
12734,[laughs] Remember how you said that you were looking in the office to do calisthenics and aerobics?,Uh weight lifting yeah.
12735,Well today's your lucky day. I have opened in this very office building Dwight Schrute's Gym for Muscles. You wanna take a look?,I'll take a look.
12736,Two secretaries could convey a sense of importance and success to our clients. Certainly worth exploring; wouldn't you agree Andy?,I'll explore exploring it.
12737,Ok uh next stop on the tour sales. Here we go. Station stop Jim Halpert. Oh boy our resident truth teller. [Jim laughs nervously] Alright have at it. Let 'er rip. What do you hate about this place?,Well it's sales. So you have to be able to live in the world of rejection.
12738,Maybe you do. Hi. I'm Dwight. Sales is really not so hard ok? It's paper. We have it and they want it so bad they are willing to pay for it.,Jim?
12739,Jim?,Well it's not that easy. It's kind of sometimes difficult.
12740,Oh how am I supposed to pull this off? [montage of office workers in friendly interactions with Susan]. The entire office is being nice to her than they've ever been to me. What I wouldn't give for one of Phyllis' classic room clearing farts right now.,Ready? What do you think?
12741,Ready? What do you think?,Um no. This is not a gym. This is like a scene out of Saw 5.
12742,"You haven't even looked around yet. Look. Gravel bucket squat yoke [squats, grunts and lifts] Right? Dedicated phone book ripping station [tries and fails to tear a phone book in half]. You ever cut tin before? Five yards in and your forearms will be on fire. Plus I will buy the tin back from you that you cut for two cents a yard. Now let's go over membership. I'm going to need the first month's and the last month's up front. $49 per month. But every third month is $59 a month. But the fourth month is a discount month at $19 per month'",Obviously you know how a gym works. So you know I'm not going to pay money for this. You want people to come to your gym? Make a real gym.
12743,Obviously you know how a gym works. So you know I'm not going to pay money for this. You want people to come to your gym? Make a real gym.,Darryl... [picks up sledgehammer and swings it at a hanging tire]
12744,Are you telling me that there's no one in this entire office that could use an extra pair of hands?,[laughing nervously] Yes.
12745,So what happens next?,We get you over to HR and then we get you set up with accounting. [phone rings] Hang on. Hello?
12746,We get you over to HR and then we get you set up with accounting. [phone rings] Hang on. Hello?,[on phone] Say hello grandma.
12747,"Hold one finger up to Susan. You'll just be a second. You numbskull. You were given a very simple task. I could not have been more clear with you. Now say, 'are you taking your medicine?'",Are you taking your med-meds?
12748,Are you taking your med-meds?,Why can you not say exactly what I tell you? Undo this. Undo it. [Robert and Andy hang up phones]
12749,Why can you not say exactly what I tell you? Undo this. Undo it. [Robert and Andy hang up phones],You didn't say goodbye to your grandma.
12750,Who's spotting who? Don't use the bike in the corner. That's Bruce's. Jeremy says',"Enough Oscar, enough."
12751,Kelly?,I have these new sneakers which are basically like a gym for your feet.
12752,Did you bring your passport with you?,Who walks around with their passport?
12753,Who walks around with their passport?,"Well, I do. Always ready for adventure."
12754,Have you had any?,No.
12755,"Andy, if he didn't want her working here then why did you hire her?",it was a mistake. But one that can be fixed by all of us being mean to her.
12756,How can we do that? She's simply wonderful.,This is all pathetic.
12757,How mean are we talking about?,"It would be great if she were gone by lunch. Erin, you're up. Find her a place to work, but not too comfortable."
12758,"Um, do you think it would be possible to move to that desk over there? Because this seems a bit cramped and I don't have a computer.",Well that's a sales desk.
12759,[grabs phone] Aw... He's so tiny. Is he in a ladle?,"Yeah, he's in a ladle."
12760,That's adorable. How on earth did you get him in a ladle?,He did it himself.
12761,"Andy! Andy, could you step in here, please? We'll fix this.",[in robot voice] What is going on?
12762,[in robot voice] What is going on?,"[chuckles] Please. Andrew, my wife... has brought up an issue that requires your attention. So, uh, if you'll excuse me, I should step out, get to the ATM before that homeless man sets up camp for the night."
12763,"Okey-dokey, artichokey. You hate it, don't you?",Do you not want me here?
12764,Do you not want me here?,Why would you say that?
12765,Why would you say that?,It's okay. I understand. I'm not sure how I would feel about having the boss' wife work for me either.
12766,Why would you not want me working here?,I don't know. [chuckles]
12767,"I think I understand what you're going through. My husband can be a very difficult man to read, can't he?",Yes! The dude is an enigma.
12768,"Mm-hmm. So he is mixed up in this, isn't he?",Ah... [stammers]
12769,What do you think you're doing?,Getting my sweat on.
12770,"I build you this temple to the human body, and you're lifting what, five pounds?","I just did, like, 35 minutes on the treadmill."
12771,I was watching you. You want to know how long it really was?,No.
12772,"Dude, I'm gonna be here all week, right? Five days a week, I figure I'll start slow.",Is that the same philosophy you apply to buffalo wings? [points] I want you to bring that same buffalo wing passion to this gym! I'm gonna make you look like Lebron James!
12773,Is that the same philosophy you apply to buffalo wings? [points] I want you to bring that same buffalo wing passion to this gym! I'm gonna make you look like Lebron James!,It's Lejon Brames.
12774,Is it? Because we talked about it and it seems like that might be what you want. Which is fine.,Where did this come from? Did Andy say that?
12775,Where did this come from? Did Andy say that?,"No, he did not, but I could tell he was struggling to understand what was expected of him."
12776,"What's the struggle? He made a great call, hired a great person.",You sure about that?
12777,You sure about that?,Absolutely.
12778,No games?,No games.
12779,Andy?,Yes?
12780,Yes?,Why do you keep looking at my husband?
12781,Why do you keep looking at my husband?,"Andy, just answer the question."
12782,No games?,No games.
12783,"That's not true, is it?","No, it's not. I tell the truth most of the time and I was just telling the truth about your husband. Jim knows. He was there."
12784,"Let's get Jim in here. [Jim shoves out of fram in his chair, Robert looks for Jim] Where's Jim?",He just rolled out and crawled out.
12785,"Can you call security, tell 'em to keep an eye out for him? Time to settle this.","[to Hank who is closing the gate] Oh wait, wait, wait! Hold on, hold on. I just need to get through. Just real quick. Real quick, open... uh, okay. [runs]"

12787,Okay. What about your friend?,Oh boy.
12788,"First thing, we're gonna stretch the pelvic bowl. Ready? Get down on the floor.","Okay, I'm not doing that."

12971,"What, as some sort of last hoorah?","Yeah. All of us in the pool, saying hoorah. Maybe the last one that says hoorah is it."
12972,"Hey Oscar, was that you who just created a party out of thin air or was it me?","That was you, Kevin."
12973,"You going tonight, kiddo? Cause I can give you a lift.","Oh, I don't know, Meredith. It seems like you shouldn't drive maybe ever."
12974,How do you know where I live?,Andy followed you home after the Christmas party.
12975,Why?,He wanted to make sure California didn't put it in you.
12976,Wow. Andy's such a weird stalker. Following me home like that when he has a girlfriend? I should get a restraining order. [squeaks],"[sticks a hand in the pool] Oh, it is warm."
12977,[sees Andy's hand in his pocket] What are you doing?,Hmm? Flicking a bug off my wiener. [they both laugh]
12978,Hmm? Flicking a bug off my wiener. [they both laugh],Gross. I'm getting a drink. Do you want anything?
12979,Gross. I'm getting a drink. Do you want anything?,"No, I'm good."
12980,How is everything? How's your car?,It's great. You know. Reliable. Great mileage.
12981,Is that so? How about this weekend we take that sucker to a duck pond or something? Maybe get caught in the rain?,"Well, I can't. I'm going skiing with Jessica. you know, a couple of dopes on the slopes."
12982,No. What?,Hey.
12983,"Uh oh, look at this. Red plastic cup, red plastic cup. How about that?","You know, you are just as dumb at night."
12984,What you doing?,I'm relaxing. Scram. [pushes her]
12985,"Hey, Stanley. Um, what happened to my pants?",I moved them. Pants only need a chair if there's a person in them.
12986,"Come on, don't you want to play?",Oh really?
12987,Oh really?,Yeah.
12988,"Yeah, you want to play you little hick? [kicks her in to the pool, Erin screams]",Whoa.
12989,How many bottles? Three hundred?,"[laughs] About twelve hundred. What the hell, grab a bottle. Less inventory for the lawyers."
12990,Really? Why?,I don't know. Maybe not. Just come.
12991,"[laughs] You regret attacking me now, hick? Huh?","Stop it. Dwight, I was flirting with you. I was trying to use you to make Andy jealous."
12992,I'm not going to help you. Why would you choose me? Because I'm mighty? Because I'm the manliest man in the office? I'll do it. [he picks her up],[giggles] Oh Dwight!
12993,[to camera] Is he looking? [shakes her head] Oh. You can stop.,"Okay, you can stop."
12994,"Whoa, you guys, I just found this insane engagement ring. Is anyone missing this?",The main stone's missing.
12995,"Toby, what's compelling about this is the note of persimmon. Right?",Note? It's a symphony.
12996,Note? It's a symphony.,"Okay, you have to join my wine-tasting club."
12997,"Toby, you are playing a dangerous game. Guess I'm through the gateway now, though, right?","[to Val] You know, I don't think I've ever been in this exact angle before. I was scared at first, but I like it."
12998,You in?,"Yeah, sure, sure. I'll be right in."
12999,What is the most romantic possible thing?,We can get some chicken fights going in the pool.
13000,Dang it! What the heck already?,"Hey, Cathy. Chicken fight!"
13001,"Okay, yeah. Who's going to be my partner? Where's Jim?","I'm right here! [gets in pool] Cold. Cold. Come on, Cath."
13002,I can't believe you're wearing it. Are you not superstitious at all?,Shh. Of course I'm superstitious. What are you talking about?
13003,Shh. Of course I'm superstitious. What are you talking about?,"The ring of a failed marriage might have some sinister energy, right? Am I just being silly?"
13004,"The ring of a failed marriage might have some sinister energy, right? Am I just being silly?","Oh, I don't think you're being silly."
13005,[comes up from under water] How was that?,Okay. Watch my toes. [does hand stand]
13006,Hey Val. Want a beer? It might taste better than that pool water you've been drinking.,"No, I'm good. Thank you."
13007,Cool. [to Kevin] Does Darryl not swim?,"That's racist! I don't know. But I would say, by looking at him, no, Darryl does not swim."
13008,One more?,Yeah!
13009,"[muffled] Dwight are you okay? Hey, damn it-","[coughs up water] Erin, did we win?"
13010,"[coughs up water] Erin, did we win?",Sure. Sure we did.
13011,"Ugh. Same old party, same old people. Am I right? Reminds me of Phyllis's birthday.","Ooh, do not remind me of Phyllis's birthday."
13012,"I know. [laughs] But boy, that Erin. She sure is a ripe little tiger, isn't she? Rroww! And to think, I always thought of her as a second Meredith. Respectfully, I don't want us walking into a similar Angela kind of situation.",Mmm.
13013,Yeah. Oh wow. How did you know it was mine?,The Bernard family seal. Duh.
13014,"Oh, you weren't going to do that?","Honestly Erin, I don't know what I'm doing. I... I just... I don't know. Thank you."
13015,"Hey, um, I think you parked my car in. Is there any way you can move your van?","Oh, I'm sorry. When I got here, I put my keys in a bowl."
13016,Are you serious?,"Robert, I want you to know, I'm here to rock with you as late as you want, man."
13017,"Two pools. A divider. A bridge. Good choice. It says everything about everything, right Robert?",What's the water like?
13018,What's the water like?,Nice.
13019,"Hey, have you ever been checked for scoliosis?","I don't know, why don't you check me Dr. Shrute. [laughing]"
13020,"You date a guy, you find out he was engaged to your coworker so you throw cake at him. It's over. You start liking him again so you ask him out with a puppet show. He says no. Then he follows you home to make sure that you don't kiss somebody. Then he ignores you at a pool party? Am I right ladies?","[Erin helps Dwight stretch his inner thighs] Yeah. Oh, yeah. Oooooh, yeah."
13021,You guys ready?,Bring it on guys.
13022,Ready?,I'm ready.
13023,"Stress is like the uptight mayor or a town who's saying, 'Hey, we're uptight, you can't dance,' and then you have to be like, 'Oh yeah, Mayor Stress? Well watch this!' And then... we dance. Oh how we dance. [dances to Kenny Loggin's Footloose] Sex also works.",Hey! Jim's back from jury duty.
13024,How was jury duty?,"It was pretty uneventful, actually."
13025,What was the case?,"Uh, hit and run."
13026,Did you send him to the slammer?,Nope. Not guilty.
13027,Is it black? 'Cause that would be hilarious.,Why?
13028,Why?,You know.
13029,Would it be more hilarious than Angela having a Chinese baby?,"A little bit, yeah. Right guys? Back me up."
13030,"A little bit, yeah. Right guys? Back me up.","Eh, a little bit."
13031,"Oh, did I win the pool?","Ah, no. Right month, wrong year."
13032,"Come on, Judge Judy, tell us your case. What were the deets?","Mine was actually a pretty boring case, so-"
13033,How could it be boring? You were there for five days. Titillate us.,"Yeah, you owe us. I had to stay until six twice to cover for you. My wife got to the TV first, had to sit through damn Rizzoli and damn Isles."
13034,"[whispering] Guys, I don't know how many of you have seen- Gabe? Bring it in. I don't know how many of you have seen a premature baby before. It's going to be really tiny, so please don't say anything offensive.","Got that, bimbo?"
13035,"Got that, bimbo?","Got it, bimbo. [Oscar knocks at the door]"
13036,Yes?,"Knock, knock. Oh!"
13037,Oh... I don't- I don't want any- what are you guys doing here?,We wanted to say hi to the newest little Dunder Mifflinite.
13038,And the victim rode his bicycle into the left hand turn lane but the perp was already in the left-hand turn lane?,Mm-hmm.
13039,"What's up, gangstas?",Jim was lying about jury duty. He was lying the whole time so he could go do yoga or go canoeing. I don't know what this pervert likes. Fire him!
13040,"Okay, okay. [sits, exhales] But let's just say that Jim was lying about jury duty. You would have to fire him, right?","Yeah, sure, of course. I'd fire him to Timbuktu. [Jim laughs nervously]"
13041,"No, not after what I told Dwight about firing you. No. Here's what we're going to do. We're going to have ourselves a good old-fashioned cover-up. Have you ever heard of a Connecticut cover-up?",No.
13042,Do you know why you never heard of it?,No.
13043,Are you sure you can keep this under wraps?,They used to call me King Tut because I'm so good at keeping things under wraps.
13044,[pulls food truck up to where Dwight and Nate are standing] Where you want I park?,"Okay, everybody, gather 'round. Got a real special surprise for you. [indicates Ernesto and assistant who are carrying empanadas]"
13045,Como esta? [speaks Spanish],"Uh, I'm going to say 'I' when I'm talking for Ernesto, so instead of 'he says blah, blah, blah,' I'm going to say 'I say, blah, blah, blah,' but that's for him. Anyway, it was something like, 'He remembers Toby.' [makes face] 'I remember Toby.'"
13046,"Okay- oh, Jim. Hey, this guy look familiar?",Uh-
13047,"Yeah but who remembers all their customers? I mean, I can name like three of our clients.","Okay, he remembers Toby, the most forgettable man in the known world. [Ernesto says something in Spanish]"
13048,"Great. And while we're enjoying these delicious empanadas, Jim, why don't you tell us your story again?",Why? Everybody's heard it.
13049,Why? Everybody's heard it.,Walk us through it. What time would you get there every morning?
13050,Walk us through it. What time would you get there every morning?,"Hey, Murder She Wrote. How about we drop the whole 'Murder, She Wrote' thing, okay? Jim was at the courthouse for jury duty every morning. How do I know? Because I drove him there."
13051,"Hey, Murder She Wrote. How about we drop the whole 'Murder, She Wrote' thing, okay? Jim was at the courthouse for jury duty every morning. How do I know? Because I drove him there.",Why?
13052,Why?,Why? Why? [looks at Jim]
13053,Why? Why? [looks at Jim],Because my car broke down.
13054,"Wait, wait. You live by the courthouse. So you drove from near the courthouse, out to Jim's house, and then back to the courthouse?","Thirty minutes out, thirty minutes back, easy hour. And I would watch that cute little tushie scurry up those courthouse stairs every morning and that was that."
13055,"[to Ernesto] I'm sorry, do you have any American Mexican food?",We're getting buried out there. What was that stuff about the car breaking down?
13056,We're getting buried out there. What was that stuff about the car breaking down?,"Well, I think you handled it pretty well."
13057,"Okay, listen, all right? Dwight's on to us, he's going to figure it out really soon, so let's just get ahead of it, let's tell the truth.",[sighs] I don't even know what the truth is anymore.
13058,Is he really five pounds?,Mm-hmm.
13059,"Nine pounds? Really? I thought you said five. You know what? I was under so many drugs, I felt like I was at a James Taylor concert or something, oh. So, what did you bring?","Oh yeah, I don't know if it's right, but-"
13060,"Uh, excuse me, can I have everyone's attention for a second? First off, I just want to say that I'm really sorry, I didn't know that my absence last week would have been a burden on any of you, because, though I did have jury duty last week, they did dismiss me early on Monday. And I think you're going to find this pretty hilarious. I kind of, uh, well, maybe took the week off.",What?
13061,What?,Funny? No? Nobody laughing?
13062,Funny? No? Nobody laughing?,"[laughs] You're screwed! Oh, it's happening. It's really happening."
13063,"What the hell, Jim? I covered for your bony butt.","Pam really needed some help with the kids, so, I promise my intentions were good."
13064,"All right, well. Let's get this show on the road, shall we? Allow me to give you a hand. [puts Jim's things in a box] Here we are. So long, clump-mate. I'm going to miss you. Truth be told, I never thought that this was how it was going to end. I always thought that I was going to defeat you somehow. But you've defeated yourself. [laughs]","Dwight, cut it out. I'm not firing Jim."
13065,"I know what I said. Jim, you're in deep doo-doo. Do you understand? I have one thing to say to you, and I'm going to say it in front of this whole office. Look me in the eye. [gives Jim a limp slap]",That's it? This is crap! [dumps the box on Jim's desk and leaves]
13066,That's it? This is crap! [dumps the box on Jim's desk and leaves],"[on voicemail] You've reached Gabe Lewis, I'm currently indisposed. Leave me a message. Ciao. [beep]"
13067,"It's fine. Pajamas aren't supposed to be baggy, right? It's not the barrio.",The only premature baby in this room is the baby this baby ate.
13068,Really?,Angela.
13069,"Oh, hey. Have you seen Gabe?","He went to the car or something, but he'll be back."
13070,Don't you want to see the baby?,Psh! Why? I know what Angela and the senator look like. I can mash that up in my head right now.
13071,Psh! Why? I know what Angela and the senator look like. I can mash that up in my head right now.,I promised I wouldn't tell.
13072,What?,She got pregnant before the wedding.
13073,How long before?,"A month. [Dwight leaves, Oscar calls after him] You didn't hear it from me!"
13074,Dwight?,Dwight.
13075,[to Cece] You want a giraffe?,"Yes, I am brining my kids in to help me get out of this hole. And you all remember my beautiful wife, Pam."
13076,Split the difference?,Jim.
13077,What?,Hi.
13078,How about a little visit?,"Wow, what a surprise. That's crazy. You guys get to meet the little heck-raisers."
13079,Did you say something about this one bringing in something for these people?,"[gasps] Yes! Cece wanted to thank everybody for letting her daddy stay home with her all last week and play, so she brought you a little treat."
13080,Cookies?,"No, but that would've been a really good idea."
13081,"Wow, these are incredible. Cece, did you do these?",No.
13082,"She says 'no' to everything. You know, she thinks my name is 'No.' Cece, do you want some broccoli?",Yes.
13083,Why am I shorter than the table that I'm standing next to?,There's cross-hatching in some of these. That's kind of advanced for a two-year-old.
13084,"Cece, this is your big sister Kelly. Did you color this pretty picture?",No.
13085,"Hey, Cece, why don't you draw another picture for us, exactly like this one, or at least in the exact same style?","You know what? I don't think you need to do things on command. That's very weird. I'll just take that. Thank you. I think we should just wrap up the show, kiddos. Right?"
13086,"You know what? I don't think you need to do things on command. That's very weird. I'll just take that. Thank you. I think we should just wrap up the show, kiddos. Right?",[cries] Mama!
13087,Need I remind you that we were together a month before the wedding?,That is completely untrue.
13088,Completely true. Remember? Angela. No.,You said that Robert was not fulfilling you-
13089,All done?,Yeah.
13090,"Before I go, may I?","Sure. [gives Philip to Dwight] Watch the head, watch the head."
13091,"Nurse, you know that baby in there, baby Philip? Cancel the circumcision.",Who are you?
13092,Who are you?,I just might be his father.
13093,"[Philip is crying] I know, buddy, I know. Cece, you want to come? Want to come out?",No!
13094,"Oh bud, I know. Do you have a pacifier or anything?","I'm looking, I'm looking for the pacifier."
13095,You want to grab her?,"I'm gonna grab her, okay."
13096,"I have a kid. Last week, Jim at home? That was no vacation.",Jim.
13097,"Dwight, what the hell? You can't smoke in here.","Oh, right. [sighs] The office looks different now. Huh. Smaller. Maybe I just feel bigger. Hello Gabe."
13098,You had something important to tell me?,"Oh, you know, I did but now it seems infinitely insignificant."
13099,"Jim? Oh, right. Nah, forget it. He was doing it for his kids. I get it. Kids drive us dads crazy. Sometimes I feel like they're raising us. Am I right?","I would love for everyone to just forgive me. But, if that's not happening, I'm not averse to just buying them all off."
13100,"Alright guys. You know how we all like the red licorice but it's always buried behind like a ton of black licorice? [points to pile of candy] Bought it all. Now it's like red city in there. So, enjoy it.",Mmm-hmm. Moneybags. Must be nice.
13101,So you effectively spent what...four dollars on the entire office?,"Uh, I can't get a handle on it. Am I cheap or rich? I can't..."
13102,"Uh, I can't get a handle on it. Am I cheap or rich? I can't...",You're nothing. When I think about all the gas money I spent on you. Washing my car to make sure you-
13103,"[interrupting] Alright. Well, enjoy the red licorice, and good riddance, right? [tosses black licorice into trash]",Whoa whoa whoa whoa whoa! So you're just gonna throw away perfectly good food?
13104,Whoa whoa whoa whoa whoa! So you're just gonna throw away perfectly good food?,"It's not really food, right?"
13105,"It's not really food, right?",I'm really hating this Jim guy!
13106,When were you going go-karting with Darryl?,It's a lunch thing.
13107,"Ok. Well, hey, you're not here. You don't know, Ok? It's intense. They made me eat black licorice.","I have a recurring nightmare that I've been wrongly accused of a crime and twelve of these idiots are on the jury. Stanley is fast asleep, Kevin eats the evidence, Phyllis's name is Allison but it really is Phyllis, Jim is foreman of the jury and pronounces me guilty. The cop takes me away and tells me that I've been a bad boy and we have sex in the hall. She leaves the handcuffs on. They take me away to prison. The guards are all women. [sighs]"
13108,"Hey, aren't you an actor?",No.
13109,Weren't you in Sweeny Todd last year with Andy?,"Uh, no."
13110,You hired your actor friend to come here as a cop?,That is so offensive and ridiculous. I-
13111,Are you glad to be back?,"Yeah. Yeah, I mean I could have used another week, or three."
13112,What are you doing here? You just had our baby. Our collective Dunder Mifflin...family baby. Four days ago.,I wanted to come back to work. Not everybody needs some long luxurious Parisian maternity leave. [removes coat]
13113,What?!,Damn girl! Your body!
13114,"Really? I feel like this big rhinoceros. Anyway, I wanted to thank you guys for covering for me so I made some treats. I've got brownies and magic cookie bars.",[murmurs of delight as people shuffle toward the treats]
13115,"Oh Angela, those brownies have walnuts in them and I think Kevin's allergic to walnuts. You're allergic to walnuts, right Kevin?","Extremely, but I'm gonna fight through it."
13116,When did you find time to do all this?,"Babies sleep a lot Pam, if you feed them enough. Brownie Pam?"
13117,"Babies sleep a lot Pam, if you feed them enough. Brownie Pam?",Thank you. [takes bite] Oh my gosh. It's really good.
13118,What?,I think you're going to like it.
13119,That...[quickly] you got a promotion! [Dwight turns back] Right? I mean that's not the kinda thing you wanna read quietly at your desk.,"If you make me head of sales one more time, I swear."
13120,And here's some facts for you. Did you know frogs can hear with their lungs? And that flamingos can have orgasms that last 30 minutes.,Ah! Love to learn.
13121,What do we have here?,"Val knit me a beanie. But I can't if it's a 'we're just friends' beanie or a 'I'm hot, you're hot, let's get it poppin'' beanie. So I'm gonna up the ante, give her a clearly romantic gift, and we'll get to the meaning of the beanie."
13122,Really?,Mm hm.
13123,Does this have anything to do with what you were talking to Andy about?,"God, you're such a spy."
13124,[clears throat] Notice anything different about me?,You're wearing the beanie. You like it?
13125,You're wearing the beanie. You like it?,Super comfortable. Like sweatpants for my head.
13126,"I like to knit, don't hate. And who's that for?","Oh, this is a gift, for....my man Nate here."
13127,What?,Yeah.
13128,Can I open it?,"No, no, no. Maybe just later."
13129,How'd you know?,Just a hunch. Your gift is on the way.
13130,"My first task as special project manager Dwight Shrute? Assembling a crack team. I need people who are loyal. People who'll help me get an inroad with the gay Hispanic community. People who won't be missed. We don't need idiots, good for nothing's, methheads or... What's your name?",Kathy.
13131,Why? Does he think you're going to Florida?,I hope not. [laughs] Because I am not going. Two question marks?
13132,I hope not. [laughs] Because I am not going. Two question marks?,"No, just do one. Two question marks is kind of aggressive. You know it's like wha-what?? Just do one."
13133,"No, just do one. Two question marks is kind of aggressive. You know it's like wha-what?? Just do one.","You wanna take Darryl, Phyllis, Toby, Angela and Oscar?"
13134,"You wanna take Darryl, Phyllis, Toby, Angela and Oscar?",Yes.
13135,Can I interest you in someone less essential? Like uh a Creed or a Meredith perhaps?,Oh my god.
13136,Are you kidding me?! I'm supposed to get in an airplane with those nincompoops? We'd never get off the runway.,"Alright, look. I gotta keep this office functioning somehow. So, I have put together a list, here's your team. Darryl and Phyllis you can have, but you're also taking Kathy, Kelly and Kevin."
13137,Kevin!? Kelly!? Kathy!? Andy just gave me a chain with three weak links. Have you ever tried to use a chain with three weak links? I have. And now I no longer own an arctic wolf.,"Well, let's hear it."
13138,"You wanna call someone? That texted you!? Do you wanna drive them away? I mean, ugh.",[on phone] This is Darryl.
13139,"Oh, sorry I asked for the main shipping number. I just need the address for the warehouse? I want to send my girlfriend some flowers.",Your girlfriend? Is your girlfriend Val?
13140,Your girlfriend? Is your girlfriend Val?,"Yeah, do you know her?"
13141,"Yeah, do you know her?",We're friends. We're friends.
13142,"Cool. Um, so can I get that address or...?","Yeah sorry, I'm just looking for a pen."
13143,Why do you need a pen?,Back off! I got my reasons.
13144,"May I have your attention please? Could Kathy, Darryl, Phyllis, Kevin and Kelly please join me in the conference room immediately?",Why?
13145,Why?,"Oh, no big deal. It's just that you five have been deemed most deserving of a three week all expenses paid business trip to Tallahassee, Florida."
13146,What?!,"Oh, I'm sorry Stanley, I can't share any more details with you. You see, Andy rejected you."
13147,"Wait. Kathy gets to go? Uh, why does she even still work here? Pam is back.",It just feels like a slap in the face.
13148,"I can understand your pain and your rage, but you know what? Andy is an honorable man, let us not question his choices. I'm sure he had his reasons.",We're not questioning his reasons. I just wanna know what they are.
13149,What are the criteria for going?,"It might be innate goodness versus innate badness? But there's an easy way to find out. [knocks on Andy's office door] Oh Andy, gotta few questions for you."
13150,"It might be innate goodness versus innate badness? But there's an easy way to find out. [knocks on Andy's office door] Oh Andy, gotta few questions for you.",Mooshie mooshie. [Dwight laughs]
13151,"Uh, the Florida picks got out, and people were just kind of curious as to why they weren't picked and maybe you could just clarify?",Well uh...well the deliberations were confidential so...I feel like we should respect that.
13152,Respect it? You're trying to tell me Kevin Malone deserves more than Stanley Hudson.,Hey!
13153,Important? Oh because you and your enormous monster baby are so important to the branch.,My baby is not a monster!
13154,"Guys. Guys. Guys. Come on, seriously? We cannot let this trip cause this kind of rift, guys!",Stop calling us 'guys'.
13155,Five to six hours?,Three to four hours.
13156,"I have already picked my team: Darryl, Oscar, Angela, Phyllis and Toby and that is the team that I am taking. What's that? It's not up to me? I only have influence? Well, that's all Baltzer Gladfielder had and no one eats owls for Thanksgiving.","You have two young dynamic people in this office who know trends, who know youth. That's myself and Kelly Kapoor, you need one of us there."
13157,Or both?,"Not both. Just one, me. Or if not me, Kelly. Ideally me. Again, youth knowledge. That's what you get when you put Ryan Howard on your special project team...or Kelly Kapoor. Again, not both. Thanks."
13158,"Because I feel like that I'm in a place with my gambling rehab that I can finally start going to dog racing again. You know, just sitting, watching, enjoying the sport? Maybe putting down a few dollars if there's like a crazy mismatch or something...","Ok. Thank you Kevin, we'll let you know."
13159,When do we leave?,Thank you.
13160,"Yeah, wow. It's almost like we're not all experiencing the same winter?",Florida Stanley smiles. Florida Stanley is happy to go to work. Florida Stanley is who you want on your Florida team.
13161,"Hey guys, any spots left?","Erin, you wanna go to Tallahassee?"
13162,"Erin, you wanna go to Tallahassee?",I do. I really do. I think it would be a nice way to clear my head.
13163,"Really? Oh, great. Good, ahem, good.","Now, is it too dark to say that Cici's having an operation?"
13164,"Now, is it too dark to say that Cici's having an operation?",I think you need to go to Florida.
13165,I was going to say good because I'll have all the help I need?,"Yeah, that's what I'm saying. They're incredibly helpful, you're lucky to have them. I mean with them there, you probably won't even know I'm gone."
13166,"Well, [Jim enters] No! No! Absolutely not! You are not going. Over my dead body, no. Andy?","Tuns, I'm really sorry. You're too essential to the operation here, I can't let you go."
13167,"Hey, quick question: Do you shower at night or in the morning? Cause I wanna shower when you're showering. Save some water.","OK, listen up everyone, here's who's going to Florida: Kathy.."
13168,What?,'.Stanley..
13169,Why is it so hot in here?,"Hot? What are you talking about? This is a nice temperate Florida morning. Eighty-five degrees, seventy-five percent humidity. This is the exact environment you will be facing for the next three weeks of your life. Welcome to special projects orientation. The next three weeks of your life are gonna be the most miserable you've ever faced. They're gonna be hard, they're gonna be dirty. You're gonna wish you were dead."

13171,"But? There's not buts. That's it. You'll wish you were dead. You seem a little disturbed, you wanna stay here?","No no, I want to go."
13172,Is that the buzzer from Taboo?,"SHUT UP MAGGOT! YOU DON'T WANT TO GO, RING THE BELL! RING IT! Ring it."
13173,How many of you have seen the documentary Deliverance?,How did a mosquito get in here?
13174,How did a mosquito get in here?,"I released three hundred mosquitoes in the conference room, just temporarily. When I'm done, the frogs will take care of the mosquitoes. [Frog in plastic cage ribbits]"

13180,"So, what is this special project?",Basically Sabre has tasked us with helping them branch into the retail marketplace. They want to set up their own version of an Apple store.
13181,You know what might be great? Is if instead of a genius bar we have a lounge area where people can ask questions about the product with other customers who liked it.,"Yeah. And they should have a place where people can check their computers or printers before they see you so you don't have to carry it around like a dope. Like a coat check. [Dwight writes on whiteboard] Oh, don't write it down unless you like it."
13182,It seems to me that the Apple store is kind of like a party. So I think our question is: How do we make this a better party?,No. We sell business tools and the stores need to reflect that. They need to be all business. Let all the other stores look like a toy store.
13183,"Dwight, is now a good time to go over what you expect of us?",[long pause] Yes. What are my expectations for the group?
13184,[long pause] Yes. What are my expectations for the group?,"I have been given the responsibility to manage Stanley, a solid player, Ryan, who is capable of surprises, Erin, an excellent follower and Kathy, a probably not totally useless enigma.

We're already twenty minutes late."
13187,"Hey, hey, hey, hey! Wake up! [Erin kicks him] Ow! Why are you sleeping that way?",Oh. I was reading the mattress tag and I fell asleep.
13188,Heeeere's Dwi- what the-? [sees trashed room] Oh man.,What do you think happened?
13189,What do you think happened?,"Looks like Jim got mixed up with some bad apples. [sees 'IT WAS DWIGHT' written in lipstick on the door] Oh no, no, no, no. It wasn't me. I gotta find Luwanda at The Alcohol Club. Oh. [Jim falls out of the closet, Erin and Dwight scream]"
13190,"Cool, for your kids?",Yeah. It's weird being away from them. Never done this before.

13195,Who says none of us are diarrheal?,Are you sure it's stress? Because I did poison you.
13196,Are you sure it's stress? Because I did poison you.,"Very funny, Jim."
13197,"Oh no, I'm serious. I was thinking, 'For this trip I have to do something epic, so what should that be?' and then I thought of it. I'll poison you. What are you gonna do? You gonna steal my newspaper or put a cricket in my cereal or something?",I'm gonna set your face on fire.
13198,"That's a good one. [a red sports car drives up] Whoa, Stanley! Did you just come back from burning down a rival nightclub?","Laugh it up, Halpert. I'm in Florida for a month without my family. I'm gonna enjoy this. Want to get in? You can work the iPod."

13200,Did I say 'Messina?' [tires screech],Ahh! [laughs] Sorry I couldn't resist. It's so quiet.
13201,"Hey, can you pick up the pin? Some of us like to work in our bare feet.","Of course, I will pick up the pin. It is right here. Got it."
13202,Can we see that? Did you really find it?,"Yes, right here. Got it. Dink, ow. [chuckles, clicks tongue] In the trash."
13203,"Hey, why is it so quiet? Shouldn't the phone be ringing? Uh-oh. Erin set the phone to voicemail.",Oh great. [overlapping chatter]
13204,Oh! There we go! Pam?,Yeah?
13205,Yeah?,Can you get the phone?
13206,Can you get the phone?,Well I'm not the receptionist.
13207,Will one of you get the phone? I am freaking out! I know it's for me. [Andy and Pam silently argue] Are you guys kidding me? Stop flirting and someone get the phone!,Somebody! Answer the phone.
13208,"Fine. Hello, Dunder Mifflin. [ringing continues] Hello, you've reached Dunder Mifflin. How may I be of service?",Man.

Well, sorry to disappoint, but my huge, whopping penis is right here, [points to her head] and I'm not afraid to use it. So stop looking at my breasts, and start looking at my penis. [slow clap] I'm Nellie Bertram, president of special projects. In the next few weeks we're going to throw everything you know about business out of the window and do it our own way. Are your minds blown? So, how did this special project come about anyway? Well, I interviewed to be the manager of your branch. [points to Jim] After you decided I wasn't 'a good fit-'",It was-
13215,"Ah! It was. I went on a shopping spree. Very destructive. I bought thirteen pianos. Then I realized, what if Sabre had a store? Hmm? So I called Jo, old friend, founder of Sabre, and I told her and she grabbed me by the shoulders and she said, 'Yes!' So let's talk about the Sabre store then. Probably gonna look stupid, right? Like a big turd with a door on the front, right? What do you think it should look like?","Um, it might be fun if each store had a different theme, like a beach one, a winter one, a jungle one."
13216,"Oh, no, it does. It does. It has to be winter, and I reject it. So I drew up a design concept. Probably gonna be rubbish, right? Would you like to look at it? Just so you could laugh at it.",Yeah!
13217,What is the antidote?,True love's kiss.
13218,"I'll do it! I always say, 'You want something done right? Ask Dwight.' Right? Dwight. Right? Dwight. Right Dwight, right Dwight. Sorry, now you'll never be able to get that out of your head. [reaches up, whimpers]",I can do it.

Okay, what poison mimics the symptoms of appendicitis? Oh, you don't know? Hold on. [to Jim] What kind of poison did you use?","Dwight, I didn't poison you. I was kidding."
13220,"Yeah, I'm gonna need an ambulance. Hold on, I have the address in my phone. [sees chart on screen] Hold on. Hold on one second. Uh, quick question. Vice president, uh, who is that? There's no name listed.",Is there not? Maybe I'm just waiting for someone to wow me. [winks]

Kill Mose before he kills you. [presses button] Mose, hey, it's Dwight. Listen, yeah, I just want to give you a heads-up."
13238,That was an interesting diversion. Shall we get back to the meeting?,"Whoa, are those mini pizzas?"
13239,"Whoa, are those mini pizzas?","Yeah, I figured we'd keep things savory while Oscar's mouth is in canker country. I also have some bacon-wrapped dates on deck."

13254,"Really? Okay. Retail consumer habits is... [sighs] The only thing you need to know about retail consumer habits is that consumers are mindless lemmings. They just want to be told what to do. [Erin makes the first slide appear] Fast forward to today, and the retail consumer is independent, well-informed, super smart. Super smart. Okay.",Shopping habits are both seasonal and cyclical. What does this mean?
13255,Shopping habits are both seasonal and cyclical. What does this mean?,I can field this one.
13256,"No, sit down. 'Seasonal.' Well, the Christmas shopping season is certainly a busy one, back-to-school is, as well, and in early summer it seems to slow down a bit, but shopping is also cyclical. The menstrual cycle determines every choice a woman makes. You see, during ovulation, a woman's only goal is to get pregnant, and during menses, she is sad that she has failed. And how does the woman console herself? Shopping. Shopping. Just- Jim, could you fetch me some ice chips? Thank you. Just gonna... take a... brief pause at this point.

Is Dwight's pillars, and there is only one: desire. Do we have a desire to dominate the retail space? Not just succeed in it, but to dominate, and looking around this room I'm not so sure that we do, but we can get there, and I can lead us there, and that is all that matters.","Very true. Where there's a will, there's a way. I once spent a passionate night with Hugh Grant's brother, John Grant. He's older than Hugh, just a little bit uglier. How did I pull that off?

13334,Can you' without running to the other side of the room all night?,"Yes, I can. [Cathy laughs] uh, all right. I'm really sorry. I think we'll just' we'll just watch. You can watch, not watch, whatever you want to do. Take another shower, I don't care."
13335,"Hey, Darryl. You okay?",She's got a boyfriend.

13339,"[louder] Six months?' um, okay, I'm in love with Kelly.","Put your forehead near mine,  and see if you can read my thoughts."
13340,"Try again' Ugh, I'm still getting numbers! Seven, one, one' is anyone around here thinking the numbers seven one one? 'Cause please stop, okay?","Dwight, give me a key card to your room. Meet me in seven minutes for some one-on-one time."

13342,"What? Oh, Jim, I thought we talked about this. You're cool, right?","Cathy, go."
13343,[wearing face mask with spray chemicals in hand] Where's the bug?,Awesome.
13344,"Aah! Stop, it, oh my god! That burns! what is that?!",[continues spraying the bed] It's a compound of chemicals I pulled off the maid's cart!
13345,Oh yeah? What's the first best?,"[at the door, unsuccessfully trying to open it with the demagnetized key card] Dwight? [knocks] Hello? Dwight?"

13351,"Test launch day, people. Now, I would like to fill you in on a little secret about me to inspire you today. Now, I know you probably all think I'm this patrician goddess. But here's the truth. I was born in the little working class town of Basildon, and until the age of 32, [cockney accent] I talked like this, which was bloody horrendous, innit?

Ryan, you ready to do this?","When people see this presentation, they're gonna [bleep] in their pants."
13354,"Perfect casting, right?","Schrute's out to get me. But I'm playing the long game. As soon as he messes up, I swoop in like a sexual predator."
13355,"I want to create a sense of wonder and enthusiasm as if, at the end of E.T., candy poured out of the screen. Do you understand? I wanna get goose pimples.","Speaking of pimples, let's release the BLOGGERS!"

13363,"Will someone please explain what's going on here? Since the interesting thing happened til now, so much time has passed, it's like my life is buffering.","Here's what happened. Pam and I were arriving for the day. And there was a gang in the parking lot on bikes, on, on motorcycles. And they were just hassling Pam'"
13364,So you're a blogger right?,Yeah. Blogger.
13365,How can we feel safe knowing that there are gangs here? We should call the police right now!,No.
13366,"No, no, no, no, no, we don't need to call the police. They'll just ask everybody questions, get up in everyone's business, right, Pam?",Police are a hassle. We settled this on the street.
13367,Why would you care what the police think of our neighborhood?,Because I have neighborhood Pride. 1-8-5-0-5.
13368,Me?,Right Toby? Will you teach us self defense?
13369,Right Toby? Will you teach us self defense?,"Yeah, um... I can't believe you remembered. I do self-defense. Um, I'll go put on my cup."
13370,"[on phone] Yeah, no, it seems to be going great. Andy got beat up by a fifth grade girl?","Look at that guy. He's got his Sabre phone on, and he's not even using it."
13371,"Dwight, what is a fail? That sounds bad.","Oh, no, no, no. It's good. It's really -- on the Internet, it's a really -- that's a really good, good, thing."
13372,Are you trying to sabotage this entire event?,I'm very sorry.
13373,"We gave you an Arrowhead for free for the day. How hard would it have been to do this, hmmm? 'Hello. Hi sweetie. It's Jim.

Is there anything I can do, maybe pretend to be Chuck?"
13374,"I'm really sorry. Is there anything I can do, maybe pretend to be Chuck?","You could have pretended to be Chuck. I begged you to pretend to be Chuck, but you chose to be yourself, and you can no longer be Chuck! ��Surrender the tripack. You know what you have to do."
13375,[laughs] You know what I mean? One of these buttons is -- damn it. Take over.,"Oh hey, Hey, hey, you guys, you must be lost. Listen. Excuse me, sir.

The elderly suck the life out of the young. Get them out of here!"
13376,"Self-defense is not some fun boxing match, okay? This is about escaping with your life. So... strike, scream, and run. All right? Let's try it.",[smacks Meredith's head] [screams] [runs out]
13377,"What the hell, Toby?","Okay, look, in a real crisis situation, you're not gonna have to time to think, okay? So just remember, I-A-A-T-G. 'It's all about the groin.'"
13378,"Okay, look, in a real crisis situation, you're not gonna have to time to think, okay? So just remember, I-A-A-T-G. 'It's all about the groin.'",What if you're being attacked by a ' smallish man who happens to not have a groin?
13379,What if you're being attacked by a ' smallish man who happens to not have a groin?,I don't think that's very common.
13380,What if you're being attacked by a 4'11' man who is penisless?,Why are you fixated on this hypothetical transgendered attacker?
13381,Why are you fixated on this hypothetical transgendered attacker?,"Why don't we start with the basics? Show us how to defend ourselves against a baby, and then like, a fifth grade girl, and then, you know, if we have time, on up to a scary man."
13382,"Why don't we start with the basics? Show us how to defend ourselves against a baby, and then like, a fifth grade girl, and then, you know, if we have time, on up to a scary man.","Well, the most common scenario is a larger man attacking a smaller female."
13383,"So in that scenario, what if the victim sucker-punches the attacker in the face? What can the attacker then do to better protect himself?","It's interesting that you're drawn to the point of view of the attacker. ��You would like the turn of the table. Okay, the latest Chad Flenderman novel... [everyone groans] written from the point of view of his nemesis, Dr. Lucifer Wu."
13384,Can I please leave? I have a rape flute.,"All right, well, let's try one simple technique together. Okay, why doesn't everyone stand? Okay, so... you're being attacked. You've got your hands up. Simple palm strike to the chin. Up to the chin. One, two."

13388,You know what?,You just need to realize that so much rides on this. You have no idea.
13389,What's a book? [giggles],"On my God. You're so embarrassing. ��My mom would say the best stuff, though."
13390,What did you think of the presentation?,"I thought it was great, sweetie. I would just fix that one --"
13391,Why are you just standing there? Go to a nearby store and get him a yellow or green sports drink!,"Now, if your attacker is willing to defile a corpse, you better stop playing dead right away and just make it known that you're alive."

13393,What?,You've gotta be kidding me.
13394,"Poor Andy! First you got beat up by a gang, and now she kicks your ass?","No, Kevin -- [sighs]"

13399,"No, there is shame in it, okay? We have to draw the line somewhere.","Oh my God, I think I see the imprint of a ring pop."
13400,Have you seen Erin?,I'm on break.
13401,Oh God... ��Hey no! Where do you think you're going? You've gotta stay for the big presentation we've got this young wiz kid -- Ryan. He's like an even more handsome Bill Gates.,When's the presentation?
13402,When's the presentation?,It's moments away. Just stay here!
13403,"[on phone] Hey Uncle Lucas, it's your nephew Ryan. Honestly, I could use a prescription for ritalin right now. Well, I know you did one for Aunt Carol. Oh, so it's different because it's your wife? ��Well, that doesn't make any sense to me.",How you doing?
13404,How you doing?,"Don't talk to me right now. I'm sorry. I- I know you're my boss, but seriously, you need to get the hell out of my face. What I don't understand is... [voice fades]"
13405,You're not married yet?,"[laughs] Oh, I was. My husband was my best friend. He passed away."
13406,Someone rejected you? With that body and those bazongas? Forget him!,Yeah! Forget him! And you should forget your husband.
13407,How long has he been in the bathroom?,About ten minutes.
13408,Jeez! What's he doing in there? [cell phone vibrates],"Oops, that's my phone. Am I allowed to answer it or are you gonna freak out?"
13409,"Oops, that's my phone. Am I allowed to answer it or are you gonna freak out?",Are there any bloggers around?
13410,Are there any bloggers around?,It's Ryan. 'I'm sorry. I lied. I'm not in the bathroom. I can't do it. I need to see my mom. I'm going home.'
13411,What is the delay here? Where's Ryan? Why is he not here?,"I had to send him home. As brilliant and creative as he is, he is nothing... compared to this guy!"
13412,What?,That's right. Will you just give us a second?
13413,That's right. Will you just give us a second?,You are gonna bloody ruin it. You're gonna bloody ruin it because you're a no-good half-assed cock-eyed...
13414,A costume?,"Of course there's a costume! [laughs] ��Oh, this is gonna be great. There's nothing like some last-minutes changes to really energize a presentation."
13415,Did you pass out in there? What is taking so long?,I've been in here for 20 seconds.
13416,Hurry up. Let me in. I wanna watch you get dressed. Did you find the eyeliner?,I'm not wearing eyeliner.
13417,"Okay, this isn't over. Let's stay focused, okay? ��We made fun of Andy earlier for getting beat up by a little girl, but... little things can be dangerous.","Whether it's a gremlin or chucky the doll. The key is to throw it in something. Like a fireplace, or a tub of electricity."
13418,Good point? What is a tub of electricity?,I don't... I don't...
13419,"You know why I got hit by girls? Because I stood up for others. Pam and for Toby. ��I stepped in and I didn't care that I was standing up to girls. You may wanna ask yourselves, 'Where were you when the girls came?'","Tough day. Yes. But I feel good. I put the office in their place, took a bunch of pain killers, drank a half a bottle of wine, took my pants off. ��I just feel good!"
13420,[gasps] What?! Why is that?,"He's gone, damn it! He's been promoted to VP of Sabre Retail and he's staying in Florida forever."
13421,How could I have been more clear? He had a massive stroke [slight pause] of good fortune and he is now in a better place.,"If Dwight's not coming back, does that mean we can open his treasure?"
13422,"If Dwight's not coming back, does that mean we can open his treasure?","You guys, we've gone over this, there is no treasure. [Erin retrieves the 'treasure box' and slams it down on Dwight's desk]"
13423,"When the team left for Tallahassee, Dwight told everyone not to touch his treasure. [cut to Dwight holding treasure chest and telling the office 'Don't touch my treasure. Ok, you understand?'] Obviously he wants us to obsess about it. There's nothing in there. [has realization] Which is obviously what he would want us to think, making it the perfect place to hide a treasure. Oh god, I'm Wallace Shawn in The Princess Bride.",I think that Dwight wanted us to realize that this conversation among friends is the true treasure. [everyone disagrees]
13424,"[feigning surprise] A dart? Are you kidding me? Who would put a poison dart, well, I mean, I don't know that it's poison. I mean, I just have to imagine. God, I'm glad he's OK though. Kinda sounds like he deserved it, opening another man's treasure and all. Wow!","[on a golf course] Well, mister ball, it's been a pleasure. Now, give my regards to hell. Da! [hits ball]"
13425,[to Robert] You think you're excited? You should feel my nipples. [Robert gives a fake laugh],"Oh, that reminds me. [reaching into golf cart] Little something from all of us. [hand Dwight a small wrapped gift]"
13426,"This is the last time I'll ever see Dwight. It's a weird feeling, it's, um, what's the word? It's not, it's not bittersweet. It's uh... sweet. Yeah.","[entering Andy's office] Hey, man. Selling cookies for Jada. Want the same as last year?"
13427,"[entering Andy's office] Hey, man. Selling cookies for Jada. Want the same as last year?","Would if I could. And I can so I will. Put me down for one box. Don't care what it is, dealer's choice."
13428,"[entering Andy's office] Knock, knock. Hey, Sasha's first year in the troops, so I'm selling cookies for her. Anyway, would you like some?",No. No.
13429,What?,I been selling here for five years. This is my spot.
13430,"You can't claim territories. This is the only place I interact with people. Can't you sell at your church or barber shop? [Darryl looks hurt] Or chess club, or?","You know what? It's your first time, let's split the office. You can have sales, the annex, Creed, and I don't know I'll just take, uh, accounting."
13431,"You know what? It's your first time, let's split the office. You can have sales, the annex, Creed, and I don't know I'll just take, uh, accounting.","That's it? Yeah, well, ok. Thanks Darryl."
13432,"That's it? Yeah, well, ok. Thanks Darryl.","OK, great."
13433,"When can I introduce you to my grandson? He's a wonderful swimmer. Shallow end, deep end. He does it all.","Well, today might be kind of tough, Irene. I have to talk to my old boss, Andy, and tell him I'm staying in Florida. [hands Irene a mug]"
13434,"[takes mug] Thank you. [takes a sip] Oh, what kind of tea is this?","Oh, I boiled some Gatorade."
13435,[approaches Kevin] Would you like to buy some cookies?,"Cookies, eh?"
13436,"Cookies, eh?","[singing] Oh, the springtime thinks that it's the best. And fall time thinks that it's the best. Cold time has, kind of a strut. And Valentine's thinks that it's the best. But gather round, peeps, I'll tell you the truth. Nothing beats the cookie season, that's the truth."
13437,"No, no, no. It's not fair. What if Kevin wants to buy cookies from me?",I do.
13438,See?,"That doesn't mean anything. [to Kevin] Kevin, do you want to buy cookies from me?"
13439,"That doesn't mean anything. [to Kevin] Kevin, do you want to buy cookies from me?","Oh, I definitely do."
13440,"You know, why don't we split the order? It's only fair.","No. Wait, no. I'm buying, I make the rules. I actually do want you to fight over me. I wanna be wined and dined and... 69ed."
13441,What's that?,I'm gonna tank the Sabre store at the presentation to the board.
13442,I thought you liked the store?,"Well, the store is lovely. You created a wonderful space to showcase our product line. Great job. Cheers."
13443,"But, there's a reason we sell our products online and over-the-phone. Have you ever used Sabre electronics, Jim? [Jim shakes head] They're cheap. They're unintuitive. The Sabre store would work if we adopted the carnival model of leaving town once everyone's wives do us.","Wow. When you put it that way, I guess it does sound pretty terrible."
13444,How did that look?,"I'm not just saying this, that was the best thing I've ever seen."
13445,"When you guys do that whole power of two shebang, how 'bout I pop up also? I guess we'd have to say 'power of three'. Hm, actually, you know what, yeah, that actually works. [to Nellie] You'd spin off right. I'd spin off-","You know what? That is a great idea. Cathy, write that down and print it out. It's gonna make some really good toilet paper."
13446,"You know what? That is a great idea. Cathy, write that down and print it out. It's gonna make some really good toilet paper.",[enters room] All right. There he is.
13447,What are you doing here? I thought I got rid of you?,Can I just talk to you for one quick second?
13448,Can I just talk to you for one quick second?,"What, your stylist ran out of 'messy spray'? [others laugh]"
13449,"What, your stylist ran out of 'messy spray'? [others laugh]","Um, actually it's, it's for your own good. I think maybe we should- [gestures toward hallway]"
13450,"You want to do something for my own good? Turn around, walk out that door, do not stop 'til you get to Scranton, find my cell phone charger, mail it back to me, and then go hell. [others laugh]","Nice. [To Jim] Hey, Halpert, anyone ever tell you you look like Wooly Willy?"
13451,"Nice. [To Jim] Hey, Halpert, anyone ever tell you you look like Wooly Willy?",[to Packer] Silence.
13452,Can you help me? I'm trying to make a video chat with Andy.,Just open the program and type in his user name.
13453,Can you just do it?,"[after briefly typing] Here, type in your password."
13454,"[video chat begins, Andy's head enters the screen from the side] Hello?",That's so weird. There's something wrong with my laptop. [turns laptop on its side] Oh. I fixed it.
13455,"[on phone with Jim] He said, 'I did like Dwight'? He's gonna fire him.","No, no, I think it was more like, 'you know, I liked him, but I don't anymore because he did a bad job, so I'm definitely gonna yell at him'."
13456,Did you actually try your hardest?,"Yes... my pretty hardest. Look, you haven't dealt with him in awhile, all right. He's like super Dwight. It's like he's been bitten by a radioactive Dwight, or som- Stanley, back me up."
13457,[to Kevin] What's a skinny guy like Toby know about cookies? You can't trust him to understand the wants and needs of the thick man. Maybe Toby from two years ago.,[laughs] Yeah.
13458,"That's true. If I have a question about my cookies at midnight, who am I gonna call? Darryl. Toby's probably in bed with some model.",Thank you.
13459,"Look, I need this. Ok? Your daughter is a pretty little girl. Let her go door-to-door. You think people gonna buy cookies from my [hesitates] chubby daughter?",Oh. [looks away]
13460,"[to Kevin] Oh, you know what you have to do? To decide? You need to make them do things for you. And, like, buy you things.",Or have them sing that song! That the frog does in Looney Tunes.
13461,"I don't buy it. It, that is a freckle. That is not a tan, ok? I'm gonna have to inspect it in person when you get back here. I want you looking totally 'puerto ricania' when i see you.","Well, Andy, I'm not coming back."
13462,What?,I have a job here. I work for an old lady. [turns laptop to put Irene into view]
13463,Andy?,"Yeah, that's awesome. That's great."
13464,"No, it's not worth it? That's too bad. 'Cause I was feeling particularly hungry this year.","Yeah, ok so what, you buy 40 boxes?"

13467,You're not talking... triple digits?,"Oh yeah, I'm talking triple digits. [folds arms satisfied while Toby and Darryl look at each other] Again. [both start performing Hello! Ma Baby again]"
13468,"You again? Gosh, I keep throwing you away, you keep flying back here. You're like an Amish return stick.","OK, great, listen to me. Listen to me. [Dwight makes funny gesture] No, no, I know. Will you just let me tell you one thing, please?"
13469,"OK, great, listen to me. Listen to me. [Dwight makes funny gesture] No, no, I know. Will you just let me tell you one thing, please?","Yes, you may tell me one thing. Wait, you want to borrow money?"
13470,"Yes, you may tell me one thing. Wait, you want to borrow money?",Listen to me. Robert is going to veto the Sabre store.
13471,Wait. [holds up fingers] He's gonna kill the store? And he's gonna fire me?,Yes.
13472,You know what? You might want to get to the airport. It's gonna take you a long time to get through security with all those beauty products. Bye.,"Dwight, come o-"
13473,"Gross! Don't lick my hand! God, why is there so much saliva?",AlI had to do was think about pie and my salivary glands did the rest.
13474,"What? What, what, what, what, what?","[clutching side] Oh, god! You... oh! My appendix-"
13475,You all right? You ok?,[stops whining and charges Jim] Rrrah!
13476,[to Cathy] Where the hell is he? I cannot do this without him.,I don't know. He's not picking up.
13477,Sup?,[notices Andy boxing up things from Erin's desk] What are you doing?
13478,[notices Andy boxing up things from Erin's desk] What are you doing?,I'm just dealing with Erin's stuff since apparently she's not coming back. And she didn't bother to tell anyone.
13479,"Ryan, why didn't you tell me?",Thought you checker my Tumblr?
13480,Thought you checker my Tumblr?,You never update it.
13481,"Does anyone else think this is weird? And like, kind of uncool, actually? To leave us without a receptionist?","We'll find another receptionist. I mean, that's easy. We'll be fine. [Andy nods reluctantly]"
13482,What are you doing?,I was trying to go-
13483,Get up. All right? I'm not gonna let you by.,Then you know what? I'm just gonna have to run right through you.
13484,Then you know what? I'm just gonna have to run right through you.,OK. [Dwight runs in place] What are you doing? Are you really revving up? you know that doesn't work.
13485,OK. [Dwight runs in place] What are you doing? Are you really revving up? you know that doesn't work.,[tries to jump off wall] Jackie Chan! [falls and groans]
13486,"Okay, now who do I ride to the kitchen like a pony?","Don't make me be your pony, Kevin."
13487,What do you mean?,I'm out. And so is Toby.
13488,"[tackled by Dwight] What are you doing? No. No, no, no.",This. Ends. Now.
13489,Why?,Anything else you need to talk about?
13490,Anything else you need to talk about?,Nope. I think that was it. [Dwight gets up and walks away]
13491,[to Nellie] Are you kidding? [to Robert] She's the queen of the whole freaking Magilla!,"And yet Todd, it's you who's fired."
13492,"What, you, I, I can't get fired. I'm an institution. I have been at this company for 20 years. How many of you have been here that long, huh? [Dwight exits meeting room and helps Jim up]","[Dwight and Jim enter office] Hey, hey. They're back. [Everyone greets them]"
13493,"Dwight, what are you doing here? I thought you were supposed to be in Florida?","Yeah, the crazy thing about that is, um, wow you look great. Did you lose some weight?"
13494,"Yeah, the crazy thing about that is, um, wow you look great. Did you lose some weight?","Thank you, for someone who actually notices this. No, I didn't lose weight. But I started using my makeup to contour my face to look skinnier. I actually put on five pounds."
13495,"I'm going to Florida to get Erin. [grabs coat, runs out, then returns] Forgot to turn off my email. It's crazy, right? It's just, when she said she was leaving, I felt so- [looks at computer frustrated] 'You're about to close four tabs, are you sure you want to continue?' Yes. I am sure. Ah, slow computer!","[telephone ringing] This is Pam. Oh my God, are you sure? Uh, okay. Okay, um, we'll be right there. Everybody, the balloon is falling."
13496,"[telephone ringing] This is Pam. Oh my God, are you sure? Uh, okay. Okay, um, we'll be right there. Everybody, the balloon is falling.",Nice.
13497,"How long do you think it's been up there, Kevin?","I just remember pushing aside my silky bangs to say, 'Look, a balloon.'"
13498,Hey. So they accidentally gave us an extra egg sandwich this morning. Who wants it?,oooh
13499,"Mmm. [bites sandwich] Oh, that is disgusting. Do you call that a King James breakfast pie?",What brings you to town?
13500,What brings you to town?,"Certainly not the Harry Houdini Museum. What a nobody. Oh look, some Hungarian just found their way out of a sack. Let's build a shrine. No, I've come to work here."
13501,What?,How could Robert transfer Nellie here after the Sabre store debacle? She stinks of failure. The fact that she could show her face around here is an embarrassment. I should know. I'm in an identical situation.
13502,How could Robert transfer Nellie here after the Sabre store debacle? She stinks of failure. The fact that she could show her face around here is an embarrassment. I should know. I'm in an identical situation.,Robert did say you'd be joining us. Welcome. I'm Tony.
13503,What?,"I- I said I'm Tony. Okay I made a mistake. I thought it might go unnoticed. But uh, I'm Toby."
13504,You messed up saying your name?,"It happens, okay? Uh, so let's just find an empty desk for you, and uh, I'm sure Robert will be with you as soon as he gets in."
13505,"It happens, okay? Uh, so let's just find an empty desk for you, and uh, I'm sure Robert will be with you as soon as he gets in.",That one looks empty.
13506,"Oh, is it?","I have one simple philosophy in business: if the seat is open, the job is open. It's how I came to briefly race a formula one car. The three slowest laps ever recorded."
13507,How are you? How's your family doing?,Bye.
13508,How are you adjusting to life in Scranton so far?,"So far, so good."
13509,"Ah, well, it is astounding what a difference that can make, isn't it?",Mm-hm.
13510,"Now. Let's find you something fun to do here, shall we?","Oh, I've already found it. I am manager, a natural next step. It fits like a glove."
13511,"Do you really? Because it is 10:00. I've been in this chair for an hour, and no other manager has come and sat in my lap.","Excuse me, has anyone seen Andy this morning?"
13512,"Excuse me, has anyone seen Andy this morning?","Huh. Yeah, that's weird. He's usually here by now. Right guys?"
13513,"Huh. Yeah, that's weird. He's usually here by now. Right guys?",[on phone] Hello.
13514,"Andy, it's Robert. Why aren't you at work?","Hey, Robert. Ah, I really wish I could come in to work today, but I'm super sick."
13515,"I'm in Florida to get Erin. As soon as I heard she wasn't coming back to Scranton, I jumped straight in my car and drove straight down till I hit the ocean. My heart is my map. Turns out, Tallahassee is about 200 miles inland, so I overshot a good amount. But still, not bad for a heart map right? [picking up dead fish] Oh, no. Thanks a lot, BP.",Not much we can do about this until he gets here.
13516,Can't you do something about this?,"Sometimes the flowers arrange themselves, Jim."
13517,#NAME?,What is going on? And where's Andy? And what is going on?
13518,What is going on? And where's Andy? And what is going on?,"Erin, you got a package."
13519,"Where's the postage? I mean, there's no shipping label.",Did you wash your hands?
13520,Did you wash your hands?,Yes.
13521,"Andy, what are you doing here? It's great to see you.","Uh, I am here to take you back to Scranton. Because I love you and I want to be with you."
13522,Where's the ring?,Hm?
13523,Hm?,"Where's the ring, Lancelot?"
13524,"Where's the ring, Lancelot?","Uh, would you guys mind if we talked privately for a second? Sorry, Glenn."
13525,"Uh, would you guys mind if we talked privately for a second? Sorry, Glenn.","Um, Andy... I am so happy to see you. But I'm not coming back with you."
13526,[whispering off screen] Why won't she go with him?,[whispering] I don't know. Maybe it's 'cause he's not that handsome.
13527,"So what is going on? That does seem to be the question, doesn't it? [in American accent] Hey, this is messed up, bro. Who is this weird lady? [normal voice] I know. It's a lot. So, who knows what's going on? Anyone? You, yes. Wait, I am very good at intuiting names. Is it... chumbo?","I think it's a cross between Dumbo and Jumbo, with a hint of chubby. It's not a name."
13528,"So no one can tell me what's going on. Well, let me illuminate things for you. We are getting to know each other. [in American accent] But why, m'lady? [in normal voice] Because I am your new manager.","Robert, is Nellie our new manager?"
13529,"Robert, is Nellie our new manager?",[laughs] This is an odd situation. But it's very interesting how it's playing out.
13530,We live in this world of routines and rhythms. Kevin ate someone's lunch. Phyllis has a new necklace. Who is this woman?,"I came in here simply trying to get to know you, learn your names, maybe have someone teach me the company song. And what I got in return was nothing but disrespect. You leave me no choice but to get to know you in a more intimate way."
13531,Hot tub party?,Performance reviews.
13532,How can you give us performance reviews if you don't know us?,"On first impressions, so I recommend smiling. It goes a long way with me."
13533,"So, Andrew, how does your skinny brunette girlfriend Jessica feel about you visiting your ex-girlfriend?","Well, we're not really dating anymore, so... basically, I mean, I just have to cross a few Ts and dot a few I's, you know."
13534,You didn't even stop to pee? Gross.,Any luck?
13535,Any luck?,No. He just keeps letting all the calls go to voicemail.
13536,[on phone] Andy?,Jim?
13537,Jim?,"Andy, where are you?"
13538,"Andy, where are you?","I- I'm home in bed. I've been in bed all day. I got the-- I got the serious poops, man."
13539,"What? You're in Florida? Andy, Nellie Bertram's trying to take your job.","What do you mean, take my job?"
13540,"What do you mean, take my job?","Like, set up camp in your office and is calling herself the manager."
13541,"Guys, we cannot do these performance reviews, okay? If we go into them, you're basically accepting Nellie as your manager, and trust me, you do not want her as your manager.",Trust you? The way Pam trusted you to provide for her so she wouldn't have to work?
13542,Trust you? The way Pam trusted you to provide for her so she wouldn't have to work?,I like working here.
13543,"Dwight, should she be our manager?",I wouldn't let her manage a celery farm.
13544,And when was the last time Dwight and I agreed on anything ever? [clears throat],"All right. Let's get going. First up, it is the woman with the beautiful fingernails and the tiny feet, Phyllis."
13545,What?,"Dwight, you carry this company on your massive shoulders. You are our Atlas, and for that do you not think you deserve a raise?"
13546,"Dwight, you carry this company on your massive shoulders. You are our Atlas, and for that do you not think you deserve a raise?",There's no limit to what I think I deserve.
13547,Then you accept it?,Five percent. No less.
13548,"So Phyllis, now you know the rules of the game. Would you care to have a go? I'm fairly certain you're going to like it.",Phyllis.
13549,Really?,"Oh, yeah. The way you conquered your fear and came in here, and now the way you sit there... all very impressive."
13550,Um... are you aware that Nellie is giving out raises?,I am not. Huh.
13551,"Let me guess, you want one too? Take the family to Disneytown?","Land. World. Uh, it's not that I don't want a-- well, yes, I guess I'd take a raise. That's not what I'm saying. That's not-- sorry."
13552,"Jim, would you prefer a nature metaphor or a sexual metaphor?","Oh, god, nature, please."
13553,"And there are no rules to that game. That wasn't so perverted, now was it?","Was that it? No, that wasn't bad."
13554,"Was that it? No, that wasn't bad.","My point is, there is one person in charge of every office in America, and that person is Charles Darwin. In the end, doesn't he decide who the manager is?"
13555,"My point is, there is one person in charge of every office in America, and that person is Charles Darwin. In the end, doesn't he decide who the manager is?",No. I would've said no.
13556,"I mean, if we go in there and take these raises, what are we saying? That it's okay for someone to just take someone else's job? Shouldn't work like that.","No, you know what? Nellie's right. That is exactly how it should work. Darryl, this office is mine now."
13557,"No, you know what? Nellie's right. That is exactly how it should work. Darryl, this office is mine now.",No.
13558,#NAME?,"No, go ahead."
13559,"Well, I was just going to say that, if I had my own fountain, it would be two frogs that are spitting into each other's mouth. It's just stupid. What were you going to say?","Andy, you broke my heart. Do you know what it feels like to be constantly rejected by you and to have to watch you date someone else?"
13560,"Andy, you broke my heart. Do you know what it feels like to be constantly rejected by you and to have to watch you date someone else?",You broke my heart too.
13561,"Really? Okay, well, um, I like consistency in the manager's position, no weird silent coups. Stuff like that. I'm easy.","That's not really what you want. What you want is a good night's sleep, working mother of two."
13562,"Whoa, that's kind of condescending. Would you say something like that to Jim?","Does Jim have to breastfeed? Did Jim carry around those babies for-- what is it? 12 months? Be honest, does Jim really get up in the night?"
13563,"Does Jim have to breastfeed? Did Jim carry around those babies for-- what is it? 12 months? Be honest, does Jim really get up in the night?","Well, I mean, the only reason he doesn't is because I'm breastfeeding, and Phillip doesn't like a bottle."
13564,You must be exhausted. Fancy a nap?,No.
13565,"I think you're amazing. You know that, right? Go on, say it: 'I'm amazing.'",[drowsily] I'm amazing. [sighs]
13566,Really? 'cause you've been kind of a B to him all afternoon.,"I was protecting you because I thought he was no good. But I can tell you really like him. And he's willing to lose his job for you, in this economy with Europe on the brink--"
13567,"Irene, what would you do without me?","We're not your concern, sweetheart. Besides, Glenn's going to sue Home Depot."
13568,Why?,He got his foreskin caught in some lawn furniture.
13569,"Why are you so staunchly defending your friend, who has abandoned you? Wouldn't you rather come talk with me? Maybe definitely get a raise?","Yeah, that's the thing. I don't know if you can even give raises."
13570,"Jim, have you ever heard of a character named Tinkerbell?",Yes.
13571,She dies! Now who here believes in Tinkerbell?,Let's see it. Show of hands.
13572,How?,"Come on Jim, you're killing her!"
13573,You don't have a toothbrush?,No.
13574,How do you not have a toothbrush?,I just... there's always one around.
13575,You just use whichever one is sitting there?,I always find one. Have you ever heard of buying a toothbrush?
13576,I always find one. Have you ever heard of buying a toothbrush?,Of course. I own my toothbrush.
13577,Hey Jim. Stanley's back from the hospital today. Can you sign his card?,"Oh, great. [reads] 'Glad they didn't mix up your tonsillectomy with a moustachectomy.' Oh that's not good."
13578,"Okay, Phyllis sits across from him every day. Phyllis, does he have a moustache or not?","Oh, I don't know. Now I think he doesn't."
13579,"Okay, the man's worked here for 25 years. How can none of us picture his face?",Cause we come here to do our jobs. We don't stick our noses in other people's business.
13580,"Okay, which one of these looks more right? [holds up drawing of Stanley with and without a moustache]","Neither of those looks like any person that has ever existed or been dreamt of in the history of human insanity. That said, the one on the left."
13581,"[bell dings] Guys, that's the elevator. What if it's him?","Okay, quick. Who says moustache? [Pam, Oscar, Dwight, and Creed raise their hands]"
13582,"Okay, quick. Who says moustache? [Pam, Oscar, Dwight, and Creed raise their hands]",Yep.
13583,"Who says no moustache? [Jim, Angela, and Phyllis raise their hands; Gabe enters, hiding Stanley's face]",[reveals Stanley's moustache] Ah! Ha ha ha!
13584,"Is this a video conference you're having with 'Drake, featuring Swizz Beatz'?","Um, no, I was just, um, just having a cup of coffee, kind of warming up for the day."
13585,"[laughing] Nellie, really, nine fifty?","Oh, here's what happened. Seven forty-six, my alarm clock goes off. I hear it. Whack the snooze."
13586,"Well, yes, uh... there is the whole moving to Scranton nonsense. Thirty boxes arrived yesterday from England and two trunks from Florida. Then I have to move in to my apartment in this dreadful, God knows where it is backwater suburb of a suburb, and I mean, no offense but are there a lot of Irish people living around here?",[in unison] Yes.
13587,Who's a native?,"Uh, excuse me, the tone here is getting quite hostile. I would appreciate it if you would keep that stuff on the basketball court. [everyone groans]"
13588,What does that mean?,"Okay, okay."
13589,"If you'd let me finish- Or the squash court, or the Supreme Court. Hmm?",Nellie?
13590,Nellie?,"Yes, Robert!"
13591,"Let's help her out, shall we? Go above and beyond today to show her some of that warm Scranton hospitality. Jim. Dwight. Take the day. Help Nellie move those boxes into her new place.",Why Jim?
13592,Why Jim?,"The rest of you, let's throw a party at the end of the day to welcome the newest member of our little community."
13593,"I'm sorry, we're throwing a party for someone because they're being horrible?","I'm sorry, we're taking work time to move someone's personal belongings into their new apartment."
13594,Why is she here?,[sings] Two crazy kids on the journey of life.
13595,"I know, right?","She's always late, she's always rude..."
13596,[whining] What?,I just need you to know-
13597,What is it? I didn't sleep well last night. [they laugh],[lifting box] Ugh! Ow.
13598,"Nellie, that reminds me. Do you want this chair in the bedroom? 'Cause to be honest, I don't think it's gonna fit through the door.","Don't listen to Jim. Have you ever seen him play Tetris? 'Oh, I think I'll just use this line horizontally. Oh, I had no idea what a gift this line is.'"
13599,"Don't listen to Jim. Have you ever seen him play Tetris? 'Oh, I think I'll just use this line horizontally. Oh, I had no idea what a gift this line is.'",That was one time-
13600,"Oh, no. Really? Magic? No, no, no. Let's not go there. No, nothing is more repellant than magicians. Bunch of grown men waving wands, pulling bunnies out of body crevices. Magicians are repulsive. Next topic.","[cell phone rings] Excuse me, one second. Hi."
13601,"Hey, what's up?","Ah, nothing, just hauling some cube with Dwight."
13602,What?,Trust me.
13603,"[knocks on car window] Andy! Hey, what are you doing here?","Hey, Lauren. Look at you."
13604,"Why is Erin with me? That's a great question. She is my coworker, and she needed a ride because she totaled her car.",Oh. God.
13605,"Okay Andy, that is a bachelorette party, this is Jessica's friends and they've been drinking during the daytime. Should we go?","Yeah. Uh, you know, we had such a quick window to make this work, I think we should probably just-"
13606,Whoa. Who is this guy?,Here's the two of them taking a hike. I'm guessing he's some kind of friend.
13607,Like a boyfriend?,You read my mind.
13608,"I couldn't afford the flat myself. So I sold it at a loss. Ah, but what's ten years of bliss down the drain  compared with the thrill of starting over with nothing and no one?",I'm so sorry. These must be very painful memories.
13609,"God, no. That's the most embarrassing thing of all this. What kind of fool gets her heart broken by bloody stage magician?","[in the phone] You know what, Pam? I was thinking maybe we should change course here. Let's give up on all this mean stuff."
13610,"[in the phone] You know what, Pam? I was thinking maybe we should change course here. Let's give up on all this mean stuff.","What? No! No, I just had this brilliant idea- everyone loved it. You don't have a copyright on pranks. I might be better at this than you."
13611,"What? No! No, I just had this brilliant idea- everyone loved it. You don't have a copyright on pranks. I might be better at this than you.","No, that's not what I-"
13612,"Jim, could you give us a hand?","Absolutely. Yeah. [whispers] Call it off, Pam. Call it off, okay? It's way more complicated than you think. Cancel the magician. Trust me."
13613,"Absolutely. Yeah. [whispers] Call it off, Pam. Call it off, okay? It's way more complicated than you think. Cancel the magician. Trust me.","Oh, okay. Okay, I will. [hangs up phone]"
13614,What are you talking about? Yes we can.,What I mean to say is we don't want to.
13615,It'll be fine. Just act natural. Do you want a gummy penis?,"No, uh, I'll just have some gummy bears."
13616,"Ew! Aww! That seems gross at first blush, right? But relationships are always more complicated than you think. I mean, we don't know Matthew's history with this other woman. Maybe she saved his life. [laughs] I don't know.  I just- I don't think we should rush to judgment about Matthew. Maybe we don't pop that one.","No, pop it. Pop it! [Lauren pops the balloon, party guests cheer]"
13617,"No, really. [to Jessica] Where's my Andy?",I dunno.
13618,Aww. Are you going to sing for us?,"Well, you guys are doing a pretty good job with the scary yelling, so..."
13619,"Okay, they're almost here- What? Come on. If you guys are gonna be mean, could you at least be subtle? [rips down ugly photo of Nellie]","Oh, in the warehouse we use code names for people we want to talk about. Andy was Jelly Roll. Mike was Dennis the Menace. Ryan was douche bag."
13620,"No, that's a great idea. Let's have a code name. How about Mondays? I hate Mondays? Mondays are the worst?",Nobody's named Monday.
13621,"Hey, how about we go with Pam? Simple, easy to remember.",Cause there's someone already here named Pam.
13622,"Best gig ever. They asked me to play only originals. I said, 'Have you heard my originals? They're terrible.' They said, 'Even better.' I said, 'I get it. It's an ironic party for Nellie.'",Maybe we should just go.
13623,"No. I gotta do this. Hey Jessica, could I talk to you?","Uh, yeah, sure. What's up?"
13624,"Uh, yeah, sure. What's up?","Uh, maybe we could talk in private?"
13625,"Uh, maybe we could talk in private?","Uh, yeah. What is it?"
13626,"Uh, yeah. What is it?","Well, first just let me say that I hope when I'm done with the sort of ugly bits that we can stay friends."
13627,You're breaking up with me?,"Uh, no. No. You always do this. You twist my words around. Part of me thinks we should just end this right now."
13628,"Oh my God. Are you leaving me for Erin? You said she wasn't relationship material and she wasn't as good as me, but it's her, isn't it?",Whoa! That? No. Okay. You want honesty? Super-honesty time. I'm gay.
13629,Whoa! That? No. Okay. You want honesty? Super-honesty time. I'm gay.,What?
13630,What?,"I am gay, and I prefer men."
13631,-that you guys hate Pam. Do you ever wish she would just... disappear? [sets off flash paper],"Oh! [laughter, murmuring]"
13632,Right? Rough scene.,Yeah.
13633,"Are you Nellie? Oh, I think you're my volunteer. Come on over here, huh?","Oh, I'll do it. I will volunteer."
13634,"Oh! Big guy, huh? How's the air up there? Watch out for... birds. [chuckles] All right, let's uh- let's do some card magic. Now, what I want you to do is... I want you to pick a card just by looking at it. Do not say what it is.",[picks a card] It's the four of hearts.
13635,"Looks like we got a guy from another country here, huh? No hablo el cardo, senor? Hmm? Ha. All right, the card is picked. Now sir, will you please shuffled the deck? [Jim drops the cards] You didn't just do that on purpose, did ya?",[to Dwight] Why is Jim treating the magician poorly?
13636,[to Dwight] Why is Jim treating the magician poorly?,"Little known fact about me. Before I was a magician, I used to work at a rope factory."
13637,"[yells] What the hell? All right, where's Phyllis? Who's Phyllis? Look. This is really uncool, okay? I put on a clean show here-","Okay scram, wizard."
13638,What?,You heard me!
13639,"Well, I thought it was quite fun. In fact, I think they're brilliant employees, in their own way. Don't you see what I see?","Interesting. Yes. No, yes, I see that. Great work, team. Great party."
13640,"You think this is a great party? This cake has vegetables in it. Like a salad bar, Robert. How do I get this taste out of my mouth?",What? Why are we-
13641,What? Why are we-,"I just gotta do one thing. [leaves car, knocks on door]"
13642,What are you doing here?,"Hi. Super-duper honesty time. I'm not gay. In fact, I'm so not gay, I'm in love with a girl. Her name is Erin Hannon and she's right there. She's sweet, funny and beautiful and total relationship material."
13643,Why the hell did you come back here?,Go away.
13644,"Get out! You ruined my party! Who does that? Are you kidding me? [Andy and Erin run to the car] Yeah, run away!",You're disgusting!
13645,What? That ain't right.,"Yeah, he came and went."
13646,"Wait a minute! You said it was a magician, right? [Pam nods] You don't think he could've used... it couldn't have been...",Let's just- let's go.
13647,So how was the drive in?,"Oh, nobody knows how to drive in the rain."
13648,You don't say?,Yeah. You know the roads are actually the slickest in the first half hour?
13649,Yeah. You know the roads are actually the slickest in the first half hour?,"Oh, the plants are gonna love this."
13650,Time's almost up. How many are left?,"Just one. 'This weather makes me want to stay at home, curled up with a good book.'"
13651,Phyllis. This rain... does it make you wanna be doing something?,What do you mean?
13652,What do you mean?,"You know, like aren't some things just so nice and cozy in the rain?"
13653,"You know, like aren't some things just so nice and cozy in the rain?","Hey, come on."
13654,What happened to old salty?,Nellie let me bobble-ize him. His name is now Captain Mutato.
13655,Yes?,"Whoa. Well, you must be the famous Nellie Bertram I've been hearing all about. I am the famous Andy Bernard you've been hearing all about."
13656,"[cries, slams fist on desk] Why?",[Ryan and Kelly make out in the nook] But she's had a bad influence. She's like an addict. [Ryan and Kelly argue] And I just had to get her clean.
13657,Don't shake our baby?,Yeah.
13658,"Hey, um, what's the deal with this guy? He's really into Kelly, huh?","Yeah, they're really great together."
13659,"Maybe we weren't right together, but... it's weird. I'd rather she be alone than with somebody. Is that love?","That's about it, yeah."
13660,I'm sorry?,This is what I was trying to tell you.
13661,"Great. Five, four, three, two, one. Angela, please dock Nellie's pay a hundred dollars. Angela?",Do you want to go again?
13662,Do you want to go again?,Angela?
13663,Angela?,Let's go again. Five... four...
13664,"Seriously, Angela?",I got a little bit of an anger problem. Got me in some trouble a couple years ago.
13665,"Whoa. No. Are you kidding? You were so sexy. Just the thought of you last night, like, crazy turns me on. It just didn't last night.",Really. It's not a big deal.
13666,Yes?,Did it affect you outside of the office?
13667,Did it affect you outside of the office?,How?
13668,How?,I don't know what the technical term is... Penial softiosis?

13710,Huh?,"I know a few of his songs, but what were his big ones?"

14588,"Uhh, a little bit. It's a lot of pressure, you know, but that's what I signed up for right?","Jim, limo's here."
14589,How you doing?,"Alright. I mean, it's what you want, so..."
14590,"Me and Val were going nowhere and if I'm gonna be working in Philly, I'm gonna need my freedom. So, I convinced Val to breakup with me. Here's how you do it. You say, 'What are you gonna do, breakup with me?' Like it's a joke, and then you gain a lot of weight.","I'll never be sorry, not for a moment of it."
14591,Jeez H. in the morning. Will you stop your nagging already? No wonder Jim left you.,He didn't leave me. He just went part time. [Meredith scratches her head vigorously] Can you just fill out the form please?
14592,He didn't leave me. He just went part time. [Meredith scratches her head vigorously] Can you just fill out the form please?,Yes.
14593,"Oh God, Meredith, lice? Did you not sign a pledge to shower?","What? Lice? Oh my god. Lock the doors, we are on full quarantine."
14594,"What? Lice? Oh my god. Lock the doors, we are on full quarantine.","Dwight, relax. It's just lice. Maybe, possibly."
14595,Just lice Pam?,"Of all of the vermin in God's great green kingdom, lice are the ones I detest the most. My first day of school, I had lice, and no one would play with me. For 15 years, they called me freak and four eyes and sci-fi nerd and girl puncher. All because I had lice when I was 7."
14596,"Pam, really? Come on.","Hey, what do you want? I know who I am. Nobody's taken Meredith Palmer to the opera to meet the queen."

14599,"I wash my hands at least six times a day. Toilet seat covers? Yes, thank you, even when I pee. Apparently, none of that is protection enough. Not when it comes to Meredith.",What are you wearing?
14600,What are you wearing?,"It's a Hazmat suit. That stands for hazaderous materials men's suit wearing. If you rent more than four times a year, it just makes sense to buy. Is there anyone else here that is lice free? [Phyllis, Kevin, Darryl. and Nellie raise their hands] Excellent. Do you have your own hazmat suits?"

14606,"Oh my God, Meredith what are you doing!?","Baking a cake, what does it look like I'm doing? Getting rid of the lice."
14607,"Baking a cake, what does it look like I'm doing? Getting rid of the lice.",Oh stop! I am so sorry!

14609,What do we do about our heads?,I'm not gonna lie. Lye!

14611,[walks in conference room] Shaboom! How do you like me now!?,Oh.
14612,"No, no, it's not a big deal, please. No. Um, Meredith can I get you something special while I'm at the store, candy, or...or one of those stylish turbans?",Thanks Pam! I'll take a pack of Nicorette gum and a pack of Kools.
14613,"What's gonna make you feel better, big guy?","When I was a kid, my grandmother used to make me chocolate cake when I wasn't feeling good. She's not around to do that anymore. I'm sorry, I just need a moment to myself just to clear my head."
14614,Are you kidding me? I can literally scalp tickets to this.,"Well, do you think you can sink one from deep?"
14615,"Well, do you think you can sink one from deep?","Listen, I don't mean to intimidate you, but I did play a little high school ball."
14616,"Alright. [Jim's phone rings] Oh, sorry. I'm so sorry. It's my wife, can I take this?",It's your wife? You better take it.
14617,It's your wife? You better take it.,"Right! [Jim laughs as he answers the phone] Hey, what's up? Everything ok?"
14618,"Right! [Jim laughs as he answers the phone] Hey, what's up? Everything ok?","Oh, no everything's great! Um, I was just calling to see how the meeting went."
14619,"He's really making you work for it, huh?","Yes, it is very stressful. You sure everything's okay?"
14620,"Yes, it is very stressful. You sure everything's okay?","Great. I am killing it over here. [drops mayonnaise on the ground] Jim, I gotta go."

14624,"Oh, Creed, I'm so sorry. I'm...I'm already partners with Pete, right Pete?","Uh, yeah. We promised each other if we ever got lice, we'd buddy up. Sorry, man."
14625,"Hey, Creed, wanna be my buddy?",Oh God. Stuck with the weirdo.
14626,You don't want bugs. You know? Who knows where those bugs will end up?,[putting mayo on Stanley's head] You're getting a bargain. I ain't got no hair no more.
14627,[putting mayo on Erin's head] How's that?,I feel it working. [Erin and Pete playing around with the mayo] Eiffel tower!
14628,Can I help you?,"Well, we don't want to pry but we heard you broke up with Darryl."
14629,"Ok, thank you. Is that all?","No. No, that is not all. Let me tell you what real life is like. The men dry up, and the nights get lonely. The only calls on your machine are for collection agencies about that pair of motorcycle boots you never even wore.

You buy a diamond ring for yourself, wear it on your right hand, and tell yourself, you're all you need. One day, you're alone, tired. At your feet, a dying bird. But where did it come from? Why did you kill it? Is it because in some strange way it is you?"

14741,'Loyalty pledge'?,"Come on, Dwight, stop overreacting. I'm getting all my work done here. No customers have complained. Nobody even knows."
14742,"Bust out your complaint files. I need everything you've got on Darryl since he started working for Jim in the last few weeks. Break it down by keyword, okay? 'Infuriating, irresponsible'...","They got us set up with Windows 95, ��so you're kind of dreaming here."
14743,[writing on white board] Customer Loyalty. What is it? Can you hold it in your hand? Can you nudge it with your finger? Can you dump it on a woman? No. Why? Because it's an idea. But what does it mean?,"Ooh, it's when you get a free sandwich after you've already eaten ten sandwiches."
14744,Not even close. Mr. Romanko has been a client for 20 years. He came in today in a rage. Why? Because of Darryl. Because Darryl was focusing on outside projects and needs to remember his first priority-- the client.,I wouldn't say a rage.
14745,"No, you're not going anywhere, okay? You are angry, and we are gonna hear you out, all right? Because business is about relationships, and the key to relationships is what, Darryl? ��L--",Loyalty.
14746,"Yes. I mean, it is everything. Let's all ask ourselves, have we been faithful in our relationships?",That's none of your damn business.
14747,I'm sorry. Do I still need to be here?,Yes.
14748,"So is it all right for her to flirt with Creed, for example?",Let's try it out.
14749,"Oh, I'm sorry. Didn't you cheat on Andy?",Yes. And he didn't like it.
14750,"Does Mr. X know that Erin has a boyfriend, or did Erin keep that from Mr. X?","Okay, this is really hard to follow. Can we just say Pete because that's the guy that Erin's flirting with?"
14751,"Okay, this is really hard to follow. Can we just say Pete because that's the guy that Erin's flirting with?","Ladies and gentlemen, the Little Ladybug Ballerinas."
14752,Really?,"Oh, I'm sorry. Sorry."
14753,"[whispering] Hello? Yes, this is Pam Halpert. I got the mural? [Loudly] Oh, my God!",Shh!
14754,"Thank you so much for coming. Darryl and I will be here to serve you for years and years and years and years. [chuckles] So, should we go call Jim and tell him to go screw himself?","Dwight, look, I'm sorry you're having a hard time with this, okay? Athlead is my future. No disrespect to Dunder Mifflin, but if I can have fun at work, I want that."
14755,"Dwight, look, I'm sorry you're having a hard time with this, okay? Athlead is my future. No disrespect to Dunder Mifflin, but if I can have fun at work, I want that.",It can't be more fun than selling paper and paper products.
14756,"Are you pretending to be crazy, huh?","Well, Andy's cute, but he's too vanilla, whereas Pete - he's just one sick dude. I mean, you know this guy likes to get weird."
14757,"People, it's 2013. Erin is a strong, independent woman. Who says she has to end up with any man?","Okay, can everyone please stop speaking for me? Andy is my boyfriend. Pete and I are just friends. And that's the end of it. Right, Pete?"
14758,"Okay, can everyone please stop speaking for me? Andy is my boyfriend. Pete and I are just friends. And that's the end of it. Right, Pete?","That is correct. Come on, guys, where is this even coming from?"
14759,"That is correct. Come on, guys, where is this even coming from?",Your feelings for Erin? Probably your heart... and a little bit your penis.
14760,Your feelings for Erin? Probably your heart... and a little bit your penis.,[groan]
14761,"Peter, please. We completely understand your concerns here. Let us just show you the latest projections. Jim?","Uh, Wade actually has those on the road, but he's gonna be calling in with those numbers any second. So just hold on one s--"
14762,You looking for fun? It just found you! Woo! [laughs] Here we go! Yeah!,"Yes, we will be delivering a shipment of paper today, but I will also be delivering you a big shipment of fun!"
14763,How far is this place? [turns off radio],"Uh, not far at all, but I thought along the way, we could play some sports. [throws small ball at Darryl]"
14764,"I'm just curious though, what do you have against Pete and Erin?","Well, Andy wrote me a really nice recommendation letter for the adoption agency, and I-- I just sort of felt I owed him one."
14765,'What we have'?,Mm-hmm.
14766,It's 30 degrees out. You drinkin' a mildshake?,"Nope. [throwing milkshake] Fire in the hole! [laughs] Oh, yeah! Now that's what working at a paper company's all about!"
14767,"Wait, what you doing? No, I need the k-- We have to go.",You just threw a milkshake in a restaurant where they make minimum wage.

14769,Wait. What?,"[recorded on phone] Excuse me, I have to get back to work."
14770,What? What was that? Did I just hear you laughing with glee?,No. I was clearing my throat.
14771,"So, how's it going?","We lost Bridgeport Capital. I have no idea what happened. It's like everything I did, he just wouldn't go for it."
14772,Can you figure out how to upload Cece's dance recital? I definitely could use a pick-me-up.,"Um, actually, funny story -- I didn't get it. I shouldn't have been so cocky about my rectangle-holding skills after all."
14773,"You're not serious, are you? You didn't get any of the recital?","No, I got the teacher introducing them and then the applause afterwards. But not so much of the middle part."
14774,"Oh, great. So we'll see somebody else's kid with Cece in the background? I mean, it's really not that hard to film a video.",Is there-- um... you want to ease up a little bit?
14775,Is there-- um... you want to ease up a little bit?,"Look, Pam, I don't know what to tell you. I mean, what do I do? It's gone. That moment's just gone. I missed it."
14776,"Look, Pam, I don't know what to tell you. I mean, what do I do? It's gone. That moment's just gone. I missed it.","I don't know, Jim -- maybe you should have been there."
14777,"You're not serious, right? I mean, how is that fair? I'm in Philly. These are my days in Philly. You've agreed to this.",You know what? I-- I-- I don't think you want to start a conversation with me about what's fair. Okay? This is way more intense than I ever --

14779,"I don't know how else to tell you, okay? I'm doing everything I can every week to bring home something...","I am-- I am-- I am trying to make everything perfect here, okay? So that you can have everything that you want."
14780,"I am-- I am-- I am trying to make everything perfect here, okay? So that you can have everything that you want.","I'm doing this just for me? Is that what I'm doing? I'm doing it just for me. If that's what you think, then this is a really sad night. But you know what? I got to go. Okay?"
14781,"I'm doing this just for me? Is that what I'm doing? I'm doing it just for me. If that's what you think, then this is a really sad night. But you know what? I got to go. Okay?",Yep.
14782,We'll talk tomorrow?,Yep. I'll talk to you tomorrow.
14783,"Hey, you okay?","What am I doing wrong, Brian?"
14784,"What am I doing wrong, Brian?",Nothing. You're doing the best you can.
14785,"Hey, it's just a tough situation, all right?",It's getting tougher. I just didn't know that it was gonna be this hard.
14786,"Hey Brian, you got a sec?","Yeah, hold on a sec."
14787,"Sure, anytime. Uh, how about you and Jim? Everything squared away?","Yeah, mostly."
14788,When are you gonna boom me?,"Uh, listen, they're cracking down on us talking to the subjects. It's a lame rule, but, you know, I wanna' I, I'll see you later."
14789,"Hey, so I hear you're bringing in some people to interview for the sales job?","That's right, a couple of old friends. Ballers only. Must be this cool to ride."
14790,"Oh, did I? Oh, yes, I did.","Wallace is letting me hire a junior sales associate to sit at Jim's desk while he's away in Philly. Finally I'll have someone at my desk clump who gets me. It's like, 'Really, Jim? You don't understand the difference between a slaughterhouse and a rendering plant? Uh, remind me not to lend you any dead cows or horses.' Wow."
14791,"Wallace is letting me hire a junior sales associate to sit at Jim's desk while he's away in Philly. Finally I'll have someone at my desk clump who gets me. It's like, 'Really, Jim? You don't understand the difference between a slaughterhouse and a rendering plant? Uh, remind me not to lend you any dead cows or horses.' Wow.","You know what, man? I deserve this job."
14792,"You know what, man? I deserve this job.",Mm-hmm.
14793,"You know what? You're gonna get your interview, okay? I know that you're going head-to-head against some real superstars, but you got a really good chance.","Clark has no chance. I mean, he's up against my buddy Rolf, for God's sake. Guy goes fishing with hand grenades. And Trevor ' he'll make you laugh so hard, you'll puke your pants."
14794,"This sucks, you know? You put in 12 grueling weeks at a company, and what do they do? They make you compete for a promotion, like an animal. You know, I thought this was an office, not the Thunderdome.",Big changes coming to the old desk clump. No longer a Pam-Jim alliance against Dwight. Now it is Dwight and a friend axis against Pam.
14795,"You could've just called that an alliance too, right?",I chose my words very carefully.
14796,[sighs] You interviewing for the sales job too?,No. You're interviewing for it. I'm getting it.
14797,Rolf Ahl? Sounds kinda like Roald Dahl.,Go to hell.
14798,When are you talking to David Wallace?,"I'm talking to him this afternoon, but don't get your hopes up."
14799,"Well, a lot of that information is private. How do I know you're qualified to evaluate me?","Well, I'm the one offering the job."
14800,What are your credentials?,I've worked here for 12 years. I won salesman of the year. I'm an Assistant to the Regional Manager.
14801,"Well, they can't all be winners. But Trevor's next and he's a real professional. You say, 'Jump,' and he says, 'Oh who?' He loves to jump on people, that Trevor.",What makes you think you'd be an effective paper salesman?
14802,What makes you think you'd be an effective paper salesman?,"Ooh, okay. Didn't see that one coming. Can I take a 20 on that? Maybe we can circle back around to it."
14803,"Ooh, okay. Didn't see that one coming. Can I take a 20 on that? Maybe we can circle back around to it.","Well, it's a pretty basic question for a potential paper salesman."
14804,All right. Do you see yourself as more of a team player or a self-starter?,"No, no and no."
14805,"Checkmate. You win this one, my friend. Do you validate parking?",This is a bus transfer.
14806,"Hey Jim, do you mind if I look over these price sheets before my interview?","Sure, yeah, go ahead."
14807,"Thanks, dude. You'you sure it's okay? 'Cause you're kinda'","Yeah, absolutely.  Do people like sitting next to you? You're clean, right?"
14808,"Yeah, absolutely.  Do people like sitting next to you? You're clean, right?","Oh, Dove Men."

14812,"What are we working with, peppermint or wintergreen?",Wintergreen.
14813,"You know what, Dwight?",And anoth'
14814,"Come on, man. I mean, did Trevor do that? Did Rolf do that?","Oh, you think they're my only friends? I've got way more friends than that, and they're all better than the losers who work here."
14815,"Oh, you think they're my only friends? I've got way more friends than that, and they're all better than the losers who work here.",This is not natural.
14816,"Well, of course not, but does physical appearance include smell?",They smell so bad.
14817,"If I ever get that bad, you'd tell me, right?","Meredith, I tell you all the time."
14818,What quality would make you a good sales associate?,People person.
14819,"You know we live together, right?",Yes.
14820,So why is this on your resume? [door slams],So how'd you guys hear about the position?
14821,So how'd you guys hear about the position?,My'my mom.
14822,You were in the shower or he was in the shower?,"Everyone was in the shower. It's a cow shower, so there's like, a ton of people in there."
14823,So you guys all know Dwight already?,"I was his babysitter, and then we dated for a while. He was a passionate lover and the sweetest little baby."
14824,You went to X-Men school too? [exhales],X-Men school?
14825,X-Men school?,"When I was young, I spent several years at a private school where I was told I would be taught to harness my mutant abilities. Turned out it was a conman copying Charles Xavier's School for Gifted Youngsters from the X-Men comic books. Took me years to figure out that it was a con. Some people never figured it out."
14826,How is it my fault?,"Here's an exercise for you, Jim. Imagine there are consequences to your actions. Imagine the whole world does not revolve around this. There are others."
14827,[presses speaker button] This is Dwight Schrute. Who am I speaking to? And don't lie. I can tell if you're lying.,"Hey, Dwight. It's David."
14828,"Really? That's interesting. 'Cause I was thinking that since Jim is only here part time, he might not be as invested in the decision-making process as someone like me who's here every day. And frankly, killing it lately.","I was just thinking that because this person is gonna be sitting at my desk, near my wife'"
14829,No. Why not do it now?,Yeah. What's up Jim?
14830,Yeah. What's up Jim?,"Uh' [clears throat] Well, it's about Athlead. I'm sorry. Does Dwight have to be on this part of the phone call?"
14831,"Uh' [clears throat] Well, it's about Athlead. I'm sorry. Does Dwight have to be on this part of the phone call?","I'd love to be in the loop, David."
14832,Why you make trees into bushes? You don't make paper from bushes.,"Hide, they're giving out jobs upstairs. Why don't you go up and get one?"
14833,"Hide, they're giving out jobs upstairs. Why don't you go up and get one?",Thank you.
14834,You know who else was a freak? Spider-man. And he was also a hero.,"Your friends are like Spider-man, if he had gotten bitten by a spider and then got really into masturbating."
14835,"Man, how cool is it gonna be when I start working here? Paintball fights at lunch.","Mandatory paintball. Uh, wolf, please report to the parking lot for mandatory paintball at lunch."
14836,Do you want this paper?,I sure do.
14837,Okay. Good. That was great. So. Wow. You're still at the 570 number?,I am.
14838,"Nate is a proven entity, but not without his handicaps; hearing, vision, basic cognition. Trevor is great, but I saw no fire in him today. And this is a guy who loves to start fires. Troy is literally one of a kind. He's a goblin, or a hobbit, or a kobold, which is a type of gremlin. And yet I'm hesitant. Why can't I pull the trigger on any of them?","[groaning] No, no, no. I just need to tell them. I just need to tell them. [knock at door]"
14839,Do you need to be changed?,I do that myself now.
14840,Mm. Are you going to make a decision soon? I've been double-parked for five hours. I'm wondering if I should move my car.,"No, you've been towed by now. They tow after about 45 minutes."
14841,Can you imagine how insulting that would be? The contempt that a person like that would have to have for you.,I wish I could hire all of you.
14842,"Psst. Jim Jim? [whispering] Jim, turn around. Jim, turn around. Jim, turn around.","Ahh, I love staring off in one direction. If I'm not looking south, I'm not livin'.  That's what I always say."
14843,"Aah! God, that sucks! Aah! What are you gonna do? I mean, it's your call.",Nope. Your friends not turning out to be as great as you thought? Not even Gabor?
14844,Nope. Your friends not turning out to be as great as you thought? Not even Gabor?,I guess I just have higher standards for my work colleagues than for my friends. I just couldn't picture any of them in the old gold and gray.
14845,"Well, I for one, was amazed at how qualified everyone was. You?",Yes. Thank you. Amazed.
14846,I'm sorry?,What? This is such bullcrap!
14847,What? This is such bullcrap!,"Well, you know, Wallace put me in charge, so you have no say."
14848,Wow. So much crap. It's just a load of B.C. How could you do this to them?,Too much now.
14849,"Do we get our resumes back or do you keep them? Because I only have the one, and I have a chili recipe on the back that I really wanna keep.","Okay, this is an outrage. Ugh! You know what? This is Jim Halpert's home address, in case you guys wanna toilet paper his house or whatever."
14850,"Okay, this is an outrage. Ugh! You know what? This is Jim Halpert's home address, in case you guys wanna toilet paper his house or whatever.",That seems inconsiderate.
14851,"Oh, that sounds awesome. Can we wait till I get off work?",[yelling] And what are we supposed to do until then?
14852,[yelling] And what are we supposed to do until then?,Okay.
14853,"Yeah. No limit on weapons class, right?",All right. I think that went well.

14897,"I think you might be going a little crazy with this labeling thing, man. I mean, you put your name on a five pound bag of flour. Are you honestly saying that if I needed flour I couldn't use that?","What you need flour for, Jim?"
14898,"What you need flour for, Jim?",That's not the point.
14899,What? You making bread?,"No, I'm not making bread."
14900,What kind of bread you making? Pumpernickel?,"Darryl, it doesn't matter. I think you know the point I'm trying to make."
14901,It's all good. Are we all good?,We good.
14902,What's that cooler?,Nothing. [pulls out a can of soda] It's mine. [Jim shakes his head] [after looking through DVR] What happened to my Tavis Smileys?
14903,Nothing. [pulls out a can of soda] It's mine. [Jim shakes his head] [after looking through DVR] What happened to my Tavis Smileys?,"Oh, crap. Were those yours?"
14904,"Oh, crap. Were those yours?",[pulling Clark across the parking lot] I never want to see you working in the upstairs office again. Do you hear me?
14905,[pulling Clark across the parking lot] I never want to see you working in the upstairs office again. Do you hear me?,"Well, my only crime was loving the local sports teams and trying to be one of the guys."
14906,"OK, boss. [quietly] Pam, you know this is ridiculous, right? Like you're smarter than this.","Shh, shh."
14907,What lines?,Go move some paper!
14908,"[to Darryl on phone] Hey, you know that guy Frank who works in the warehouse?","He's not my hire, but I know who he is."
14909,OK. What does he like? What's important to him? Does he have like a favorite pair of boots or a lunch box or...,What? Is he retiring? You getting him a gift or something?
14910,What? Is he retiring? You getting him a gift or something?,"Yeah, something like that."
14911,OK. [to Darryl] Do you know the plate... never mind. Why would you know that? And why would I be asking that?,So we know which truck to van...
14912,"Hey. While I got you on the phone, your husband's like a sloppy, homeless hobo. Can you fix that?",Yeah. I was kinda hoping you could. I gotta go. Bye. [to Dwight] Come on. [camera pans to Clark duct taped to a chair]

14919,This is amazing! Frank! And he's leaving a trail of poops?,Yeah. And he has saggy boobs.
14920,"I know. You miss Angela, don't you?",Ugh! Don't sympathize. You're ruining the mood. Back to work. Draw his penis.

14928,"Oh, maybe. What do you have in mind?",We can do anything you want.
14929,"I really wanna have fun today because tomorrow is going to be a nightmare. Andy's coming back from his stupid, dumb boat trip. He's been rude. He's been selfish. I think he's a big jerk. And I'm breaking up with him. Bam, Andy! How do you like me now?... I hope as a friend.","Erin says she's gonna break up with Andy, but I'm not sure. He's coming back tomorrow and surprise, today, she wants to do whatever I'd like. You know, when I was a kid, we had a dog who go real sick and we had to 'send him to a farm'. And on his last day, we did everything he loved."
14930,[has an idea and reveals a frisbee from under her desk] Wanna play catch in the parking lot?,[slightly surprised] Sure.
14931,"No... yes, yes. Why wouldn't I... wanna pretend to be gay? Got no problem with that.","All right, it'll be easy. Don't be nervous, just follow my..."

14933,[nail stylist 2 giggles] What?,Your boyfriend. He look like a pretty girl.
14934,"My boyfriend does look like a pretty girl, doesn't he? Yes, a very little pretty girl. And you know what, now that you are developing, we should go and get you a training bra.

14935,"Oh, you guys think this is funny? You know what? No more discount. [to nail manager] Excuse me. [gesturing he and Nellie] Full price. We're not together.","Oh, come on!"
14936,"Two men? [other nail stylist speaks Korean to manager, both laugh] [gestures index fingers bumping together] Doesn't work. No discount.","Oh, it works. Him and me, all right, we are crazy in love. More love than your small mind can comprehend. And we have two disposable incomes. And no kids. And we're taking our business elsewhere. [Oscar and Darryl exit holding hands]"
14937,What?,He's on a no carb thing. Supposedly.
14938,"Are you kidding? Thank you, man. I mean, I've wanted the opportunity to say thanks for... everything. And I'm really sorry about the job. That just seems crazy.","It's fine. What are you gonna do, you know? But, if you guys know of any work, I'm fully available."
14939,"It's fine. What are you gonna do, you know? But, if you guys know of any work, I'm fully available.","Well, my dad can't hear a thing. You could boom his whole life for him."
14940,"That's... OK, great. Does he pay well?",Where's Alyssa?
14941,Where's Alyssa?,"Uh, yeah. Um, you know, Alyssa's, she's not gonna make it today."
14942,What happened? We thought you were coming back tomorrow.,"Well, Valentine's surprise for Erin.  Hello? Super romantic. And I got you something. [removes wooden instruments from bag] Oh, it's a couple of pieces of bamboo. Big deal, right? No. These are musical instruments. It's so we can play island music together. Cause I have this. [removes g��iro and begins playing and singing] Clop the cloppers. Yeah, clop 'em. It's called Bembe. [sings while Kevin echoes]"

[sings while Kevin echoes]","Hey, Burning Man, if it's not selling out too much, you might want to throw on a tie. David Wallace is gonna be here in an hour."
14944,Why? Isn't he just coming in to rip you a new one for being gone three months?,"No. Please. Come on, Clark. Wallace knows that he's been gone for the last three months. [Andy stalls] Right? Wallace does know that you've been gone for the last three months?"
14945,"No. Please. Come on, Clark. Wallace knows that he's been gone for the last three months. [Andy stalls] Right? Wallace does know that you've been gone for the last three months?","I have no idea. I don't know what he knows or doesn't know. But we've been in touch the whole time.

14946,Question. Where's Jim?,He and Pam are having their Valentine's Day lunch.
14947,For two hours? Really?,"So, you're concerned about peoples' long absence from their place of work?"
14948,"So, you're concerned about peoples' long absence from their place of work?","If the shoe fits. [plays g��iro and sings, Kevin echoes]"
14949,"Well, I mean, that's OK. It doesn't mean that it's over. Right? I mean, couples fight.","Yeah. That's the thing. When we were fighting, it weirdly felt like the relationship was still alive. And, it wasn't until we stopped fighting that, we realized that it was over. You know, it's over. [overcome by emotion] I'm sorry, this is... oh my god, OK. [to Pam] We have to stop seeing each other like this. We have to find a different way to communicate other than breaking down in front of each other."
14950,What?,At least my crying won't get you fired.
14951,Crying?,I noticed that you landed the Scranton White Pages account. That is tremendous.
14952,OK. The issue is that you need to run this stuff by me. Coolio? Are we coolio? [Dwight resists] Just say the word 'coolio'.,I'm not gonna say it.
14953,No! [Andy makes a call] What do you think you're doing?,Just gonna call the Scranton White Pages and clear this right up.
14954,[on phone] Hello?,"Hey, Jan. Nard dog here."
14955,Really?,Yeah. It appears my employee offered you a price that he was not authorized to.
14956,Seriously? You're calling me a few weeks after finalizing our contract to gouge me now for more money? Is that what you're doing?,Coolio. Coolio.
14957,"You know what? You know what, uh, Nard dog? There is an option in the contract that allows me to back out within 30 days of signing. So, I would like to exercise that option.","No, Jan! Please do not listen to this boob! Remember Clark. He gave you everything. Everything."
14958,All right. Thank you very much. [examines checks] Looking good. [after noticing something on Angela's desk] Who's that little fella?,It's a bonus check. For you. From Wallace. Because the branch exceeded it's targets over the past quarter.
14959,"[emotional] Do you have any idea what I had to do to get that sale from Jan? I mean, I went all out. All out. I mean like everything was out the whole week.","He just waltzes back in here like he owns the chunky, lemon milk. Who needs him, right?"
14960,"He just waltzes back in here like he owns the chunky, lemon milk. Who needs him, right?","God! I just don't know what we'd do. I mean, short of telling David Wallace that he was gone for three months."
14961,"I'm not going to rat on him. No, Andy gave me a second chance. So, the least I could do is let somebody else rat on him. Meredith, why don't you?",Meredith Palmer ain't never been called no nark. Floozy? Yes. Alkie? Check. Einstein sarcastically? You bet. But never no nark. Vomit mop? Sure. Floor meat? That's me. Flesh hoover?
14962,Meredith Palmer ain't never been called no nark. Floozy? Yes. Alkie? Check. Einstein sarcastically? You bet. But never no nark. Vomit mop? Sure. Floor meat? That's me. Flesh hoover?,Hey!
14963,"Meredith, that's plenty. All right? That's more than plenty. Why does no one stop her?","Guys. I know that a lot of people are mad at Andy and, believe me, I am too. But, he has been through a lot and we all used to love him, right? So, if he's gonna get in trouble, just let it be his fault not ours. I don't want that on my hands."
14964,"Guys. I know that a lot of people are mad at Andy and, believe me, I am too. But, he has been through a lot and we all used to love him, right?

It's Andy! [resumes talking] All right. Back to work.","OK, I can tell you're mad at me. Do you wanna just, um, I don't know, tell me why?"
14966,"OK, I can tell you're mad at me. Do you wanna just, um, I don't know, tell me why?","I don't know. I thought that was a little weird. You told me Brian got fired for the whole warehouse thing. And you intentionally left out a kind of major, intimate detail. I don't know, Pam, I guess I just feel like a chump. Who knows less about his marriage than the sound guy."
14967,"Not helpful. Let's stay positive, people. OK?",[enters] Hey guys.
14968,"Hey! David! How are ya? Ah, we were just having our weekly round table where we motivate each other. Not gonna lie, I get as much out of it as they do.","Sounds great. Don't let me interrupt. What ever you guys have been doing this last quarter, I couldn't be happier with the numbers."
14969,"Well, finish up. I'm gonna meet with Val about that warehouse guy you had to let go and you and I will talk in 15 minutes?",Great!
14970,[whispering] We had to let a warehouse guy go?!,"You know Pam's mural? Well, Frank..."
14971,"You know Pam's mural? Well, Frank...",[interrupting] ' lit the whole thing on fire. It was crazy.
14972,What?!,Yeah.
14973,There was a fire in the warehouse?,The whole thing is in ashes. Fire department was here. It was in all the papers.
14974,"This is what I'm talking about! This would be good to know. All right, what else?",We started selling balloons.
14975,What?!,"Yeah. And, uh, Kathy Ireland signed on as the official spokes-babe of Dunder-Mifflin."
14976,No kidding?,"Yeah. In the European billboards, she's gonna be topless."
14977,"Good, good. What else?","Who knew the balloon game would be so lucrative? And thank god, right? We needed the income after the fire."
14978,"Who knew the balloon game would be so lucrative? And thank god, right? We needed the income after the fire.",What fire?
14979,What fire?,The warehouse fire. Weren't you just down there? It's like burnt to ashes.
14980,The warehouse fire. Weren't you just down there? It's like burnt to ashes.,It looked fine to me.
14981,"Really playing the scales, huh?","Yeah, it just sort of sounds like noise to me now. You think I need a new fish?"
14982,"Yeah, it just sort of sounds like noise to me now. You think I need a new fish?",I don't love you anymore.
14983,What?,"I still like you, but you were gone a really long time. And, you didn't really email me all that much. You retweeted me, a lot to be fair. But I don't love you."
14984,"I mean, what do we have left? 35, maybe 40 years? If we're lucky. I mean, I have spent a lot of time in the sun.",You got really sunburned.
14985,You really think we can get that back?,Yes. [hugs Erin] Come on. Totally.
14986,You know what? Maybe we should cancel that bottle of wine tonight.,Oh?
14987,Oh?,"Yeah. I just feel like I got a bunch of stuff to do in Philly and I'm sure you have stuff to do. So we can just... I don't know, drop me at the bus station?"
14988,"Yeah. I just feel like I got a bunch of stuff to do in Philly and I'm sure you have stuff to do. So we can just... I don't know, drop me at the bus station?",Are you sure?
14989,Are you sure?,I just feel like we're gonna fight.
14990,So... how 'bout let's not?,OK. [they begin to leave]
14991,You really wanna fight on Valentine's Day?,"Yeah, I do."
14992,"Hey, you OK?",I couldn't do it.
14993,"Oh, you don't have to apologize. I just... I just want you to be happy. OK? [Erin smiles and kisses Pete]","[bursts into Andy's office] We're breaking up. And just so you know, I was worried that you were dead. You were gone for three months."
14994,"[on phone] Hey, Andy. It's David. Still here. What was that about three months?","...No, you lied to me Andy. You pretended to be in this office for three months and you were sailing on your boat!"
14995,"Really? [reading from phone] 'Hey David, all is good in Scranton PA.'",And all was good in Scranton PA that day.
14996,Oscar says 'hi' all the time. He says all kinds of greetings. 'Hi' 'Hello' 'Hola' You're telling me you've never heard Oscar say 'hi'?,Andy.
14997,"Oh, here we go, January seventh 2013. [Reading from phone] 'Hey Andy, all's well. Been meaning to make it down there but my wife's sick.' Well, which is it?! Is all well or is your wife sick?! BUSTED!",My wife?
14998,My wife?,This has been a really tough time.
14999,Yeah?,Yeah.
15000,Has it?,"Erin just dumped me and I can't remember any of the aha moments I had on the boat, and I know it sounds weird to say but I really miss my beard."
15001,#NAME?,Shh. I'm not gonna fire you.
15002,You're not?,No.
15003,We are even...now. Understand? Got it?,Crystal.
15004,"[Crying] Ok, we ready? [cut] Don't use that part. Last week, Erin told me that our relationship would be proceeding without me. Now I have to see her everyday at work. Which is...brutal. When people say office relationships are a good idea, they never talk about what might happen if you break up.",[Moaning from office] Ahhh! Oooooh! ahh
15005,What? What is it?,"It's my aunt Shirley, she's on her last legs."
15006,What do you mean by 'poisoned'?,"Probably nothing, or strychnine. Or lemonade and strychnine. Which is actually what it was."
15007,"Angela. You owe me one, remember? Now please, she's an old woman Angela. She needs a woman's touch. It's all hanging out-",Ugh.
15008,"It's like a prehensile wing or something, you know?","Ugh! God, I can't. OK, I'll-"

15010,"Wha? Oh, burn. [laughs, Angela and Dwight move to leave.] Uh, excuse me. What, everyone can just leave whenever they want now?",How dare you?
15011,How dare you?,I'm still the boss!
15012,Are they from you?,"Well no, they're from clients."
15013,She got rid of it. My blue sweater. What is that about?,I was just leaving.
15014,"Stay! We are in the bro-zone layer. Ok? Nard dog, Plop and Clarker Posey, AKA Clarkwork Orange. Here's the sitch: Erin dumped me, natch. But she got rid of my blue sweater, which was her favorite. Is she moving on a little fast, or am I being a total psycho? Plop, you go first.",I don't know. Women do tend to move on quicker than men.
15015,"Survey says: ENH! Doesn't make me feel better at all. Zero Clark Thirty, what do you got?","Look at it this way, being a bachelor is not all bad. I mean, you've got your freedom now."
15016,Who's this little kitchen witch? She's so tiny like a little kitchen witch.,"This is Angela, and we brought you some new clothes!"
15017,New clothes? What for? [Aunt Shirley's boob shows],OK
15018,"You know what? Before you put the new clothes on, Angela's gonna get you cleaned up a little bit.",Yes. How would you like a nice warm bath?
15019,Yes. How would you like a nice warm bath?,How would you like a mean cold slap? [slaps Angela]
15020,How would you like a mean cold slap? [slaps Angela],Ow!
15021,"Ok, Aunt Shirley, dear, uh, can I get you a nice crisp liter of schnapps?",I could do that.
15022,"Why doesn't Erin seem sad? Has she found someone new or something? And if so, why hasn't she told me? Is she trying to spare my feelings? During breakups, the mind goes to some crazy dark places.","Andy, don't. No good can come from snooping."
15023,"Uh, hello! Who's snooping on who now?",What does that even mean?
15024,What does that even mean?,What's it say?
15025,What's it say?,Put it down.
15026,See?,That's where nosey'll get you.
15027,Too late. I found out she's been texting a guy named Pete. Does anybody know a Pete?,Pete...
15028,Pete what?,"It just occurred to me that Andy has been calling me Plop for so long, he forgot my real name. Which is Pete."
15029,Hey! There she is. [Pam laughs] How you doin?,"Hi! Hey, do I look ok?"
15030,"Hi! Hey, do I look ok?",You look great.
15031,[pointing to Jim's bluetooth headset] What's that? Is that a-,"Ok, I know where you're going with this, and this is who I am now. I'm a douche. But look what I can do with my hands. [Pam laughs]"
15032,"How are you, Isaac? You have something in your ear.",It's a phone?
15033,It's a phone?,"Yes. It is. And thank you so much for setting up this opportunity, I really appreciate it."
15034,[touches headset] Call you right back. What were you saying?,Ha ha.
15035,"I've gotta go, but you know what? Team Halpert, ok? You're gonna crush it, you're gonna smash it.[Pam laughs] OK, good luck!",Bye.
15036,Spray her down?,"No, it's a lot better than it sounds. There's a private shower area. Very tasteful, very rustic."
15037,"Come on in. Have a seat. Uh, thanks for coming in, I just gotta get something off my chest. I just got some really weird news and uh, I'm just gonna come out and say it. I just got off the phone with my doctor, and it turns out I contracted [reading computer screen] shlmydia...from Erin. And it's incurable. Pretty lame huh?",Yeah. [long pause] You were gone.
15038,No overlap? Great. Good. Wow. This is suddenly so easy. Guess what? You're fired!,What?
15039,What?,"Yeah. You. Are. Fired! One of the perks of being boss. I can fire anyone who steals my girlfriend. And wow, that turns out to be you. Yup. Sorry. [singing] So you had a bad day-"
15040,Andy?,..The camera don't lie!
15041,Alright? I'll be in the annex.,Rut tit doh doh...
15042,Toby?,"You can't fire Pete. You understand why, right?"
15043,"You can't fire Pete. You understand why, right?",No.
15044,"They already have a contract? [Reading] 'Mutually agree to-' Ah, every phrase is like a dagger in my crotch.","It's just boiler plating, you don't have to read it."
15045,"...[singing] talking Chester avenue, talking triplex, talking converting...Is that her? Hey guys! Say something.",Hello.
15046,"Oh, hi. They call me Marky Mark around here, because here at Simon Realty, we are one funky bunch! Come on you guys, raise the roof when I say that! I- what are you all temps again today? Let's go, Gangnam style. [laughs] He's heard Gangnam style, he knows it. Right? That's cause he's American. This is Carl. Uh, he's from here. Our neck of the woods. But Gangnam style is great, isn't it?",Oh my god. He's Michael Scott.
15047,You have to use chains?,You'll see. Here we go.
15048,Let's do it! Ready? Here's a box cutter to get her clothes off.,Dwight!
15049,[grunting] I'm gonna give your aunt a proper bath and a haircut like a lady! And you two are gonna shut up about it! Do you have a bathtub?,Yes ma'am.
15050,"This is not an office so much as it is a uh, rec room with a bunch of computers in it. Frankly, if I had my way, I'd toss the computers in the gar-bage. But unfortunately we use them for practically everything we do. So. That ain't gonna happen. He's a temp, don't worry about him. Alice! Alright, stay awake ok?",Hey Nellie. Mmm. I am so sick of February. It's the shortest month but it sure doesn't feel that way. We should catch up.
15051,For two years! Then what? Another year picking out a stamp? Another six months before you decide to lick it? Just- I don't want to hear it!,"My aunt Joan. Oh, uh well, she uh, she worked here before I did, so there's no nepotism involved. In fact, to be honest with you I'm probably a little harder on her than I am on the rest of these people. Ah, cute. Not work on this...work on this months. Ok Nana? Uh, when I say 'Chillax' people chillax. Watch this. Hey Roger, chillax! Must not have heard me."

15053,"Step this way for The Spanish Inquisition! [laughs] Kids in the Hall. Just, it's not high pressure. Just a little Coffee Talk. Ok? Like butta. Come on in here. Mike Myers.",[Mouths] Oh my god.
15054,"Thank you! Thanks, thanks a lot. Really appreciate it. You guys are supposed to have my back. OK? Instead you let a guy named Plop steal my girlfriend.","Hey boss, I did everything I could. I invited Pete out for drinks, I emailed him shots of my junk...."
15055,That doesn't matter. Ok? What matters is that I am hurt! Deep hurt inside of me. I don't care if they're Romeo and freaking Juliet! I feel like the guy that Juliet dated before Romeo. Probably her boss. And guess what? Juliet's boss also had feelings.,"Hey, Andy."
15056,What?!,You've got a booger bubble going on there.

15136,"Why can't I just be nice? Truth is, I really like you guys. I really do. OK. The apology's just half of it. The big thing is making amends. And, that's why I brought these. I went out to the Steamtown Mall and I got you all cupcakes. From that place 'Nipples'.",I think it's called 'Nibbles'.
15137,"Huh. The mind sees what it wants to, huh? [hands cupcake to Erin] There you go.","Hey, hey, guys. Wait. Before we accept these cupcakes, I think we need to have a conversation privately in the conference room. Don't eat the cupcake."

15181,What?,Phyllis is masturbating. In the office right now as we speak.
15182,Can we skip the color commentary and just have Andy go out there and fire her?,He- he can't do that.  Turns out she's allowed to have feelings of sexual arousal.  It doesn't become a violation until she physically acts on it.
15183,"Whoa, whoa, whoa, wait a minute. Why is Phyllis so aroused?",She's listening to 50 Shades of Grey.
15184,What the hell?!,"It's OK guys, she's no longer horny."

15202,Watch this: Eat Fresh. Now what does that make you think of?,Subway sandwiches.
15203,How? I didn't say Subway sandwiches. It's called playing the subtext.,Wow.
15204,#NAME?,The space dust does it.
15205,"Andy, are there documentary groupies?",Of course there are!

15215,We need to know more. Did their shots have sound? What exactly did they get on tape?,I sneezed into my hands without using Purell and then dipped into the candy jar.  Did they film that?
15216,I sneezed into my hands without using Purell and then dipped into the candy jar.  Did they film that?,My first week here I sneezed directly into the candy jar because I thought I'd get more [Angela and Oscar make disgusted faces] I thought I'd get more screen time than anyone.

15248,What?,I just got a text from my brother. Scranton Times Tribune.com. There's a review of the documentary!
15249,[gasps] What does it say?,"I don't know, Phyllis! I just got the text and started screaming, 'Red Alert.'"
15250,"Well, the alert was already set to 'Red' because of Stairmageddon. You think I should set it to 'Double Red'?",I think we should.

15254,Oh! Which public figure?,I bet it's Katie Couric. I've been saying this for years.
15255,[walks into the office grunting and wheezing] You own the building. Why can't you fix the elevator in the middle of the night? Who do I look like? Jackie Joyner-Kersee?,"Well, I did say it would be an inconvenience. You should have called me from downstairs. We could've met in the lobby. It's time to go out on a sale! Here we go."

15266,[on the phone] Directory? Movie Star department. Back. Directory.,"For five years I've held my instincts in check because I wanted to be made manager. Maybe it's time for me to just let that thought go. It's kind of painful, but it's also freeing in a way. Now it's all about my instincts."
15267,"Hey, c-c-can you just let me out of here before whatever comes next?","Don't worry, it's just a bull tranquilizer. Nothing to be alarmed about. It's just a man pointing a bull tranquilizer at a coworker."

15269,"Is he gonna be okay? I mean, weren't those darts intended for an animal, like, two to three times larger than him?","Okay, this dosage was meant for a very small bull, and Stanley's got way more body fat than they do."

15279,"So how does it work? It's like, you know, the action of talking to a third party breaks up the log jam, or'",You're really there to talk to each other. I would say that the therapist is more of a facilitator.
15280,"He might start by asking each of you, 'Why do you think you're here?'","He took this job in Philly without telling me. He bought our house without telling me. At a certain point, he��shouldn't��be rewarded for that."
15281,"Well, what's a little while?",What do you mean?
15282,What do you mean?,"I mean, what's the end date? It must be really hard for her to sign on to be unhappy if she doesn't know when it's gonna end."

15292,Does anything go on top of the mouse?,Yeah. Little hat.
15293,What's the mouse's name?,"Eh, you know, it really doesn't make sense to name the mice. They're kinda like cannon fodder, you know? You're not one of those PETA guys , are you? [cat jumps off dog] Oh, great."

15305,"It's a long drive. He was in the backseat. But right now we're talking to Mrs. Davis about the full range of the products that we offer and our competitive rates, right, Stanley?","Ooh-hoo, look at that baby'"
15306,Like this? Watch.,Eee.
15307,[laughs] Right? Come on!,"Yeah, maybe I'll never be manager, but I just managed to get our most stubborn salesman to close a sale with one of our biggest clients, and I must say, it's the most pleasant I've ever seen Stanley. I think we should consider injecting him with bull tranquilizer on a daily basis."
15308,"So, what can you do?","[Australian accent] Well, what can't I do? Right, I can sing, I can dance, I can play the banjo, innit? And if you hadn't noticed, I've got a pretty good British accent."

15319,"Yeah, Ok. [Closes door] Alright. Where were we?",Something full of acid.
15320,Who's Carla Fern?,"Who is Carla Fern? Well, wow. Uh, she's my agent and my drill sargent. And one of my best friends. Oh, and Oscar, I already figured it out. If I have to get emotional in the film, I'm just going to think about you getting dumped by the Senator."

15327,Do you need an agent?,"No. He's- I mean, you've never acted in anything before. He's just my entourage."

15331,"Kevin, did you make that yourself?",Yes. In a way. From one that I bought on Craigslist.
15332,Really? [to Dwight] Thank you.,This is flatter.
15333,Was Dwight rooting for me? Hmm. I hadn't noticed.,I'm not giving up.  I'm going to keep making planes until one of them flies. Like Wilbur and Orville Redenbacher.

15344,"Darryl, what do I do?","Hold up, I'm looking at my spit with a microscope."
15345,So?,I can't squirt stuff in my eyeball.  I've never even used an eye dropper.
15346,[to Dwight] Is there a reason that we're excited for that little woman?,"Yes. I pity her. She was recently in a situation where she could have had it all, and instead she lost everything."
15347,Oh. Is she a gambler?,"In a way.  But not in a stand up and cheer kind of way, like the song."
15348,What's the hold up here?,The actor's crying.
15349,Andy Bernard can't squirt water in his eye and act like it doesn't freak him out. But you know who can? Older Male Lab Assistant Number One.,Do you believe in me?

15353,"Are you guys high? Because if so, to speak my truth, I would appreciate the sacrifice of including me in some hits off your kind buds.",We're not high.
15354,"[fake throws and drops plane] Oh! Oh man! It slipped out of my hand, what a whiff. Ah, how'd that happen? God. [Angela smiles]",We want you to win. Dwight told me about your situation. It's such a pity. Use the money wisely. [Angela looks disgusted]
15355,Two grand huh? I know a guy who can turn that into eight hundred dollars. And it's me.,"[To Esther] Well, I guess you needed the money more than me huh? Use it wisely."
15356,"[To Esther] Well, I guess you needed the money more than me huh? Use it wisely.","I was disappointed in Dwight today. He showed a weakness that was unbecoming. Even if he did do it for me.

Well, you know, you can't have everything so you gotta ask yourself what makes you the happiest. You just go all in for what's most important. That's my new thing."
15361,[noticing Angela looking very unkempt] Is everything ok?,No. Everything is not okay. The county took my cats.
15362,"Wait, all of them?","Two sacks' worth. Apparently my apartment complex has rules about how many pets are too many for a studio. And while I was out picking Phillip up from daycare, they came. They came into my house."
15363,"Attention, everyone. May I have your attention? There are four new deadly weapons in this office. [kicking and punching] Basher, Thrasher, Crasher and'",Smasher!

15367,"Hey, Andy. Can we go in your office and talk?",Yeah.
15368,So you think you've been too focused on your job?,"At my last head shot sitting, I was so distracted wondering what I was missing at work that I came across totally manic. And I was going for zany."
15369,So you'you want to quit Dunder Mifflin to pursue acting?,"Well, no, actually. I see no reason to limit myself to just acting. I am pursuing fame of any kind. Could be singing, could be dancing. I don't'it just' I owe it to myself and my future fans."
15370,"There's probably no way I can talk you into staying at this point, can I?",Nope. I have made up my mind. I'm really sorry.
15371,"I think just anybody could be a star. My postman, the night janitor here, but Andy? No, definitely not. Charisma black hole.","Oh, Clark. I'm actually here today. Surprise! So I was wondering if I could maybe have my desk back."
15372,"Right. Yeah. But, you know, I've actually been working pretty hard here on a daily basis. So, I kind of feel like I've earned this. I mean, you know?",You totally have. You have earned this. But maybe I could be with my wife. Kind of the whole reason that I'm here.

15374,What?,I'll come visit you.

15376,"Hey, how am I doing as your desk mate, by the way? You probably miss Clark.","Yeah, a little bit."
15377,"I'm 38, Darryl, how much slower should I go?","Show business is cold. Let's say you get a job, which you probably won't. They're not gonna cut you any slack. You're meant for a job with lots and lots of slack."
15378,"Andy's from the generation that thinks they should all be famous. What happened to the generation that knew you shut up, did your work, and died quietly from a heart attack?","Could Andy make it as an entertainer? I don't know. You know who's really funny? This bird, in the park, that can't fly right. I'd pay to see him. But I don't have to cause the park is free!"
15379,"Could Andy make it as an entertainer? I don't know. You know who's really funny? This bird, in the park, that can't fly right. I'd pay to see him. But I don't have to cause the park is free!",I will now perform the ceremonial changing of the belts.
15380,"Hold it'Take a step back. Take a step back. [they bow, then Dwight thrusts again] Okay, okay. I can't'I can't do this if you're gonna be thrusting like that, okay? I think we're gonna have to cut this off.",He will now perform the ceremonial cutting-off-of-the-belt.
15381,Thanks. I will now perform my final kata forms. You're gonna watch me right?,"Yes, I will. [Dwight starts doing karate]"
15382,Watching?,I'm watching.
15383,"Watch this part, okay?","Sensei, do you generally do house calls like this?"
15384,"Sensei, do you generally do house calls like this?","Uh, you can just call me Billy. And no. No, but Dwight insisted. He wanted to receive his black belt in the place he loves most in the world."
15385,"He said that? He's an odd guy, isn't he?","Yes. Irritating, also yes. But I gotta hand it to him, he's one of the most tenacious and determined men I've ever met. [Dwight finishes his routines and everyone applauds]"
15386,"Well, I gotta tell you, Jim, a lot of guys in my circle? They wouldn't even change their golf schedule to shore up their marriage let alone their professional goals.","Dude, there is no way that Jim is just back here to hang out with Pam."
15387,"Again! And I'm looking for a new manager. And with his performance this year, I have been considering Dwight. Am I crazy?",Not at all. It should be Dwight.
15388,You sure?,"You're gonna want to invest in a lot more liability insurance, but, uh'"
15389,"Yeah, sure. What's your question?",Our question is'it seems dumb.
15390,"Well, it's better than sticking around here and half-assing it, right?","Of course. But what if you were to stay here, you know, and 'full-ass' it? Um, really give it a go. Be the greatest manager in the history of this branch and in that way achieve the fame and immortality that you seek. Hmm?"
15391,"Of course. But what if you were to stay here, you know, and 'full-ass' it? Um, really give it a go. Be the greatest manager in the history of this branch and in that way achieve the fame and immortality that you seek. Hmm?",Nah. I like my plan better.
15392,"Well, Andy, your plan sucks, okay? Nobody is going to hire you ever. You're too character-y to be a lead and you're not fat enough to be a great character actor.",What?
15393,What?,"No, I don't think that he can make it as an actor. But, he also can't make it as an employee in an office, so why not go nuts with it?"
15394,"No, I don't think that he can make it as an actor. But, he also can't make it as an employee in an office, so why not go nuts with it?","Hey, are you still in charge of office supplies?"
15395,"Hey, are you still in charge of office supplies?",Yes. Yeah.
15396,I could give you some beginner stickies?,Anything would help.
15397,Thank you. So I saw you talking to Wallace earlier. Is he going to offer you the manager's job?,No. He was maybe thinking of you for it.
15398,"Oh, I doubt you'll make it. Very few do who've tried to be a star. But, listen, you've saved up enough money to take a couple of years off to pursue your dream and have some fun, right?","No, I just applied for more overdraft protection."
15399,"So true. Is there a question, or are'what?","Will you tell me bluntly, do you think I am making a terrible mistake quitting my job to become an actor?"
15400,"Will you tell me bluntly, do you think I am making a terrible mistake quitting my job to become an actor?","Bluntly? Yes. Huge mistake. Andy, honestly, I think you might become homeless. Or maybe even starve."
15401,"Bluntly? Yes. Huge mistake. Andy, honestly, I think you might become homeless. Or maybe even starve.",Thank you. [steps into conference room]
15402,"Dwight, could you come in here for a second, please?",Say it again.
15403,Will you be the new manager?,Where?
15404,Where?,Where?
15405,Where?,What branch?
15406,What branch?,"Here. Scranton. [Dwight falls to his knees] Come on. Come on, Dwight. Get up. Let's go. It's good news."
15407,What?,But this isn't interim manager. No. It's Dwight K. Schrute' [pulls a business card out of his wallet] Manager.
15408,Why do you already have this?,"In case Michael or Andy ever got killed in a traffic accident and there was a trade show on the same day. You will not regret this decision, David."
15409,What's up?,"Um, I have a question."
15410,Really?,I did!
15411,All right? I'm gonna wait.,All right. I did not come back here just to see you.
15412,I'm sure you did not. What was your question?,"I don't know, but it might take me a long time to figure it out."
15413,[sits at Dwight's desk] Got any hot leads?,"See, so you just push from under, and turn it around, and boom. No the staple crimps outward."
15414,"Well, how about Thursday?","Oh, well, Thursday's tough, because of'"
15415,"David. Can I just do one thing while you're making this announcement and then I'll never, ever do it again?",I don't think so.
15416,What's going on?,Dwight's the new manager. He freaking did it.
15417,"Shake on it? Done. Way to negotiate, idiot.","Don't get me wrong, I am definitely here for Pam. But this is an awesome added bonus."
15418,"So, all the numbers adding up?","Hey, I didn't get a chance to say it, but' congratulations, Dwight."
15419,"How did I just abandon my dreams so quickly? It's cause I had a fallback. That's the problem. When you have fallbacks, it's just easy to give up. When Cortez landed in Mexico, only way he got his men to defeat the Aztecs was by burning all of his own boats. So they could never return home. Huge dick move but very effective. I need to be that same kind of dick to myself.",Everyone! Changed my mind again.
15420,"What's it now, dream or no dream?","Uh, dream. Goin' with my dream. Gotta go all in, isn't that right, Jim?"
15421,"Uh, dream. Goin' with my dream. Gotta go all in, isn't that right, Jim?","Oh, don't look at me cause I think you're making a terrible choice."
15422,Seriously?,"Yeah, I'm'"
15423,"[answering phone] This is Angela. Oh. Hello, Miss Polodnikovski. Uh, how can I help you? Did my rent check not clear? Because I just transferred another $25 to that account. So if there's a problem it's clearly on your end. And'oh. Oh. Oh, okay. Good. Then... um' what is this about? No, no. Hey, hey! No, you are out of line Miss Polodnikovski. No, no you are. No you are! Evicted? Fine! I didn't want to live in that cesspool anyway! Listen, I get my security deposit back. Yes, I do. This is not fair! That is not fair! Well, you know what? You have so many hairs on your chin that Animal Control should've taken you away. That is very unladylike! You are disgusting! [hangs up phone]",What do you think that was about?
15424,What do you think that was about?,"David. I lost the Scranton White Pages account. Do you have any idea how much paper that is? And I'd just like to point out, I was mad at Dwight. I did it out of spite."
15425,"David. I lost the Scranton White Pages account. Do you have any idea how much paper that is? And I'd just like to point out, I was mad at Dwight. I did it out of spite.","We put the past behind us, though, Andy."
15426,What if I told you that I hate you and I hate this company?,"Enough, Andy. Enough!"
15427,"Just stop forgiving me, David, please? This is my last chance to honor what is best inside myself. What if I took a dump on your new car?",Oh my god.
15428,What are you doing?,"Uh, heavy stuff like books on the bottom. So it don't squash my knickety-knacks on top."
15429,"Yeah, okay. That's not what I mean. You don't have to leave because you said you would. Don't let pride ruin your whole life. Okay? It's not worth it.","Wow. Angela. What we had was great, and, honestly I think about it a lot too'"
15430,Can't you just leave?,"You know, Andy, you could just say a really nice goodbye."
15431,[whispering] You okay?,[crying] It's just a really nice song.
15432,Who knows? Maybe Andy will make it. He's not terrible.,Yeah. And people worse than him make it all the time. Like Lil Romeo.
15433,Tents? Are you thinking of going camping? I thought you found nature vulgar.,"Well, I've changed my mind."
15434,"Oh, god, could you just mind your own business?","Okay, I'm just gonna say this. You are not going to live in a tent."
15435,Are you allowed to have pets?,"Oh, Angela."
15436,You talk to Wade and Colin?,"No, I just saw I missed their call. Why? What's up?"
15437,"No, I just saw I missed their call. Why? What's up?",We got an offer on the table.
15438,What kind of offer?,A buyout.
15439,What?,"We're in play, baby."
15440,"Yeah, we did. Hey, how long'how long do we think that's gonna take?",Wade said we could do the whole country in three months.
15441,Can't do what?,"This, man. I can't do this to Pam."
15442,So is your place all bachelor-slobby and gross?,"No, it's neat and tasteful, like most gay men's homes. The stereotype holds up."
15443,"This is Tuesday, right? The coffee in Paraguay is far hotter?",Colder.
15444,The coffee in Paraguay is colder?,"No, I meant you're getting colder. The correct response is, 'the coffee in Peru is much hotter.'"
15445,"But, that's three wrong, so I gotta give you the steam. [Dwight begins to protest] Unless you want me to break protocol?","No, no. Give me the steam."
15446,Saddle shoes. With denim? I will literally call child services.,"Go get 'em, honey."
15447,Manager of Dunder Mifflin? Check. Owner of a 1600-acre beet farm? Check. Engaged to be married to an actual milkmaid? Check' on that later today. This is my grandmother's ring. It was made from a bullet I took out of her left buttock. She was a moonshiner shot by Adolph Coors. This is my grandmother's buttock bullet ring.,"Hello, good morning. My name is Andrew Bernard. You might know me from a TV documentary that's premiering tonight. I also killed it in local theater and I am fresh off of a hot industrial flick."
15448,Is that them again?,Yeah.
15449,Maybe you should call back?,I will. I will.
15450,"Let's not get crazy and ruin our no-nonsense streak, all right? So, for instance, if you're expecting a fax today, please don't yell out, 'Michael J. Fax from Fax to the Future.' Ok? That's nonsense.",Question.
15451,"We are expecting a water delivery today at 10am. What if, as they're delivering the water jugs, someone screams out, 'Nice jugs'?",That's obviously nonsense. Nonsense. And what percentage of nonsense do we tolerate in this office?
15452,That's obviously nonsense. Nonsense. And what percentage of nonsense do we tolerate in this office?,[overlapping] Zero. No nonsense. You can't have nonsense.
15453,[as Angela enters with Phillip] What is going on?,Daycare won't take Phillip anymore.
15454,Why?,"Apparently my station in life has descended to a depth even they won't forgive. So, hi."
15455,"Gotta write that down. Ok, big day today. Airing of the documentary. Who's excited?","I'd better come out of this smelling like a rose. I've been on my best behavior for nine years. If it wasn't for the cameras, I would've done some truly vulgar crap."
15456,"This airs tonight? Oh my god. If my parents see this, I am toast.",This is really huge. This is like the March on Washington but for a singing show. Can you imagine if Martin Luther King were here? And sang 'I Dreamed a Dream' from Les Mis? With that baritone? That would be historic.

That would be historic.,"Whoo-hoo! Casey Dean! Cincinnati, Ohio! [singing] Doctor, doctor, gimme the news, I got a great Casey Dean for you."

15467,But what about the assistant assistant to the regional manager?,Someone to whisper in the ear of the consigliore.

15469,I like the sound of that. Who do you have in mind?,"Well, I know this sounds crazy, but how would King Arthur choose the next knight of his round table?"

15526,Okay. [takes Phillip who immediately stops crying] You ever been in a manager's office before?,"Phillip, you wanna play a little game? It's called 'Schrute or Consequences.' You're gonna choose one of these two things. A check for a million dollars, or this dirty old beet. Yuck, pew! Which will it be? Money or the beet?"

15575,"Oh, some fudge?","Oh, thanks. I love your fudge."
15576,"Uh, no. No whorehouse. This is Dwight's night, okay?","Well, you're the bestisch mensch."
15577,"Okay, hold on. Are you sure Mose isn't going to show up?","Ever since Angela moved in and Mose had to stop sleeping at the foot of my bed, he's been acting pretty weird about this whole wedding thing."
15578,Mose has been weird? That's so unlike him.,"Yeah, sure, I'll talk about it. Why not? American's next A Cappella Sensation aired my audition. And when I started sobbing uncontrollably, apparently that struck a chord with quite a lot of people. Not a very compassionate chord. The clip went viral, as they say"
15579,"Yeah, sure, I'll talk about it. Why not? American's next A Cappella Sensation aired my audition. And when I started sobbing uncontrollably, apparently that struck a chord with quite a lot of people. Not a very compassionate chord. The clip went viral, as they say",You can't just sit here and cry.
15580,"[on the phone] Years ago, the senator promised a left turn lane by the Arby's. So I wanna know where in the name of horsey sauce is it? Well, yeah, you'hold on.",Hi. I keep seeing this symbol in the accounts from last year. It's..it's all over the place. I don't know what it means.
15581,How did you now my plane had arrived? How long have you been stalking me?,"Oh, no, no. no. My plane just got in. From New York. Are you still with Piotr?"
15582,"Oh, no, no. no. My plane just got in. From New York. Are you still with Piotr?",No. And I thought I unfriended you.
15583,Anyone can follow a Twitter feed. Wanna share a cab?,"[alone in cab} After Dwight fired me, I moved to New York to write the great American novel. I have six roommates. Heh. Which are better than friends, you know 'cause they have to give you one month's notice before they leave."
15584,Andy?,You're back?
15585,You're back?,Yeah.
15586,"[whispering to Phyllis] That's Baby Wawa, right? Oh, my God!","Hey man, good to see you."
15587,"Andy, I've been worried about you. How are you?",A little warm.
15588,"Hey, what's up?",Didn't I just see you at the airport jumping in a limo?
15589,Didn't I just see you at the airport jumping in a limo?,What? Must've been another devilishly handsome debonair individual.
15590,What? Must've been another devilishly handsome debonair individual.,Hmm.
15591,"Hey, man. How are you doing? I, um'I didn't call 'cause I figured you changed the number.",No I didn't change the number. All good though. Phone never rings.
15592,What? Ooh!,Surprise!
15593,"Kismet? Yeah, right. Pam and I came up with excuses for every other weekend. You remember my two lap band surgeries, right? Neither do I? 'Guten Prank' number one.",You ready for tonight? We gonna tear up the town?
15594,You ready for tonight? We gonna tear up the town?,"Uh, better ask Jim."
15595,"Hey, Pam! How are you?",We're fine. Yeah. [hugs both Darryl and Andy] And I'm sure that you guys are fine too. Because why wouldn't you be?
15596,We're fine. Yeah. [hugs both Darryl and Andy] And I'm sure that you guys are fine too. Because why wouldn't you be?,Mm-hmm.
15597,"Darryl, oh, my gosh. How is Austin? Tell me everything. How's the merger? I feel like I read about Athlead all the time.",I love it. And it's Athleap now. And the city is amazing.
15598,Yeah?,"Yeah. Yeah, it's hot. The music is awesome. And the tacos are'for real."
15599,They wanted me to go to the bachelorette party with the girls. Really? Such a clich��. I'm a man. So I'm going to the bachelor party with the boys. I just have to remember how I acted before I came out.,WASSUUUUP! [laughing]
15600,"Wait, why are we stopping? Jim, this isn't on the itinerary.",Get out.
15601,"Jim'wha' Come on! What'what are you gonna whack me, Jim?","No, Dwight. You'll be doing the whacking."
15602,"Hey, I know you. Are you gonna sit here and cry?","Okay, man, easy."
15603,"Hey, dude, leave him alone. What are you doing?","Jim, it's fine. He'll just get you on his cell phone and then that'll go viral."
15604,That happens a lot?,"Yeah, I guess. But things are going well actually. I spoke at Cornell during commencement week. I mean, the seniors invited me as a joke but it was a huge success."
15605,"Let's get a drink in you, huh?",Yes.
15606,"[sighs] Man, how long have we been sitting here?","Hi, boys!"
15607,"Hey, did somebody order the chef special?",Right there.
15608,"No, we haven't ordered anything. No one's even taken our drinks. Uh, what is the chef special?  [music plays and stripper starts dancing on Dwight]",I bet you boys have a big appetite.
15609,"Yes, an onion loaf for the table but that's not all. Now the chef special sounded good. What is it exactly?","Ohh, shh. [places finger over Dwight's lips]"
15610,"Okay, what are you doing? Are you giving me a taste of the chef's special? Tastes like cigarettes. That won't work. That's no good.",Whoo!
15611,What? [knock at the door] Okay.,"Oh, boy."
15612,"Wait, what is this?",Shut up. Jakey?
15613,Shut up. Jakey?,Mom?
15614,Mom?,"Wait, wait. What?"
15615,"Wait, wait. What?","Oh, man."
15616,"Rachel, are you all right?",I don't know!  I don't know.
15617,"[Jakey resumes dancing] Uh, no. It's o'thank you. You know what? You don't have to'oh no, no, no. No, no, no. It's okay.","Now, for the last time, I'd like a side salad with balsamic."
15618,"What for? We haven't even gotten bread yet. Does anyone wanna split a twice baked potato? [to the dancing stripper] Do you have those? Those aren't deep fried, right?",That was interesting. [creaking sound] What was that?
15619,That was interesting. [creaking sound] What was that?,It's just the wind.
15620,Will you lock the door?,"Okay. [opens door] It's just the wind, see? Nothing."
15621,"Okay. [opens door] It's just the wind, see? Nothing.","Alright, see, you don't have to leave the door wide open. We get it. It's the wind. Just come and shut'[Mose grabs Angela and takes her away] OH! My God!"
15622,What's happening?,"Oh, man, never thought I'd say this but I think I ate too much bone marrow. [phone rings]"
15623,"Oh, it's the girls. Hey Pam. What? Angela's been kidnapped! Phyllis left the door open and some freak came and grabbed her and fled.",Good old Mose. [laughing]
15624,What is that?,"A ceremonial bridal kidnapping. He will take the bride and hide her at a local pub and when I find the place, I have to buy everyone drinks. Ah, all right! Oh Mose."
15625,Wait a minute. You said the tradition is for the groom is search for her and it ends at a pub. So how about the last pub you'd ever set foot in in this town?,Right. Which one is that?
15626,Right. Which one is that?,"Mm, hey driver. Why don't you take us to 3030 Adams?"
15627,"Mm, hey driver. Why don't you take us to 3030 Adams?",Is that Mose?
15628,Is that Mose?,"Yes, it is! I am here for my bride!"
15629,"Well, well, well, well, well, well. That's six 'wells.' Did I get that number right, Dwight?","I heard you bought a bar, Kevin."
15630,[to Mose] Why did you pick this place? [Mose points to Jim],Ooh.
15631,You? You did this as a prank. My own Bestich Mensch.,"Nope, not a prank. I think it's time for you to bury the hatchet."
15632,Is that all it was?,That's it.
15633,You've had your drink. Now where is my bride?,"Mose! What..ooh, Mose. [Mose opens trunk]"
15634,What the [bleep] is your problem you [bleep] [bleep] [bleep]?!,"Hey. Hey, is Angela coming or'"
15635,How's Florida?,"Oh, great."
15636,Am I the only one that's nervous? How are you doing with this? Should we have bailed?,"No, no, I'm fine."
15637,How did it feel to see your lives played out on tv?,"It's like seeing a documentary about how your food is made. It's kinda disgusting. You learn a lot, but I didn't wanna know any of it."
15638,"Uh, Jim, that DVD in the last episode was so romantic. And, um, I think we'd all love to know, Pam, what romantic thing did you do to pay Jim back for leaving Athlead?","Well, I mean, How do you pay back someone for something like that? But, uh, I don't know. I'm working on something."
15639,"Well, I mean, How do you pay back someone for something like that? But, uh, I don't know. I'm working on something.",She pays me back every day just by being my wife so that's fine.
15640,[pause] I'm sorry. Is there a question?,"Uh, no."
15641,"Pam, what was in that teapot letter?","Oh, um, well, you know, I' I just' I just think I would rather keep that private. You know, if you'd been filmed for nine years of your life, there'd be some things that you just wanna keep to yourself."
15642,I hear ya. What did it say?,We're gonna move on. Next question please.
15643,Do you find that your life feels pointless now that nobody's actually filming you anymore?,Yes.
15644,I wanna know how everyone felt they were portrayed. Was it accurate?,"I got a beef with that. Um, for the first seven years, I was getting my PhD in School Psychology and they didn't show it. Yes, I was getting hammered but, hey, it was college."
15645,"I have a question for Jim and Pam. Everyone watching sees how much you love each other and how you're soul mates. So, Pam, how could you doubt that when Jim moved to Philadelphia?","Um, you know what, I actually didn't handle that move, uh, very gracefully. From not communicating to being a little selfish."
15646,"Listen, um' I was scared, you know? I loved what I had, and I didn't want to risk it. And I think that maybe I did doubt him a little too. Which was wrong because he's shown me time and again. But when the documentary started airing, people on the street told me that I had this fairy-tale romance. But there were a lot of times last year where it did not feel like a fairy tale. But then it got deeper, and it got stronger and now it's better than a fairy tale. It's like a long book that you never want to end.  And you're fine with that because you just never, ever wanna leave it.",Like Harry Potter.
15647,Really?,"Yes. Um, the thing I found most compelling about the documentary was your search for your birth mother."
15648,"So my question is, um, do' don't you hate her? I mean, I would just imagine that you were so angry at her that you would hate her.","Maybe sometimes. But not like 'hate' hate. More just like, 'Mom, I hate you!' And then she would say 'go to your room, young lady.' And I'd stamp my foot and run upstairs and I have a room, which is really cool. And then we'd just have dinner together. But I don't know. I'd have to meet her. Thanks."
15649,Yes?,"Um'Oh, Erin.."
15650,Yes? Is there a follow-up question? [realizes] Mom? [they hug],Erin' Same question but about your dad? [they hug]
15651,Erin' Same question but about your dad? [they hug],"Well, this feels like a good place to stop. Let's thank all of our wonderful panelists for being here on this wonderful panel today.  [audience claps] Next week at the Scranton Cultural Center don't forget, Irish Step Dancing semifinals. Winning team to Mid-Atlantic. [applause and scattering cheers]"
15652,"Where's the, uh, basket for gifts?","Right there, sir."
15653,"Uck, Look at all this mud. Can you imagine if I had worn my Jimmy Choos? I just saved you 600 bucks mister.","Thanks for helping out, sweetie."
15654,"Whose baby is this? Oh, are, like, a nanny now?","No, this little guy is mine."
15655,Drake is your baby's name?,Yeah.
15656,You ready?,[chuckles] You kidding? I was born ready. [mimicking heavy metal guitars]
15657,[chuckles] You kidding? I was born ready. [mimicking heavy metal guitars],"Dwight, Dwight, Dwight. Um' I don't know how to tell you this, but' we have a little bit of a problem."
15658,"Oh, no. What?",The minister just told me that it's tradition for the Bestish Mensch to be older than the groom.
15659,"[to Joan] See, I get what they are trying to do, but why are the graves so shallow?","[reading] 'Arise, my love, my fair one, and come away. For lo, the winter is passed. The rain is over and gone. The time of singing has come and the voice of the turtledove is heard in our land. Let me see your face. Let me hear your voice for your voice is sweet and your face is comely. '"
15660,Ravi? Ravi? Drake has a bit of a rash. And he's hot.,"Oh, no."
15661,I was wondering could you maybe examine him for a second?,"Oh, yeah, you're not feeling well little guy? Okay, sure. Should we go inside?"
15662,"Oh, yeah, you're not feeling well little guy? Okay, sure. Should we go inside?","Actually, could you go inside? I'm feeling a little dehydrated. I could really use a little break, have some water."
15663,"Actually, could you go inside? I'm feeling a little dehydrated. I could really use a little break, have some water.",Are you sure you don't wanna go in?
15664,Are you sure you don't wanna go in?,"Ravi, just do it. That baby is burning up. Isn't this, like what you live for? Just go. Go."
15665,"Ravi, just do it. That baby is burning up. Isn't this, like what you live for? Just go. Go.",Thank you Ravi. Thank you so much. This is great for me and for Drake. Thank you.
15666,You gave your baby an allergic reaction just to talk to me? [they kiss],Michael has so many pictures of his kids he had to get two phones with two numbers and he pays two bills.
15667,Where'd you learn to dance like that?,I don't know. I've just always been really good at dancing.
15668,Is it me? Is it Nellie?,[sobbing] It's everything.
15669,Lots of people think that Stanley Hudson's a mean old grump. [laughs] But [crying] would a grump make this? It's me. It's me.,I love you.
15670,[to Oscar] What was that stuff?,"Hey, has anyone seen Ryan' or Kelly?"
15671,"Hey, has anyone seen Ryan' or Kelly?","Ooh! Yes. Uh, They left together a little while ago. Kelly was hoping that you would keep the baby so they can start a new life together."
15672,"Um, Kevin? Oh, I can help you with that. Yeah. I mean, I can find someone who will' who will love that beautiful little boy the way he deserves.","Hey, this is better. [hands Drake to Nellie]"
15673,"If Ryan wants his baby back, please tell him where to fine me. We'll be somewhere in Europe. [looking at Drake] Won't we?",[crying] I feel like all my kids grew up and then they married each other. It's every parent's dream.
15674,"Yeah, I heard. It sounds kinda lame. [to camera] No offense. You going, Toby?","Oh, I don't know. I might turn in early."
15675,What's going on?,[sighs] [whispering] Why are you still here?
15676,[sighs] [whispering] Why are you still here?,[whispering] I'm so sorry. They were an hour late.
15677,"No, really, what's going on?","Okay, Okay. Um' so' this past year has been really great, and you've been great and I just' I know that you had to make this choice and you had to give something up for me. But I never want you to have to give up anything. I just thought if I could get us an offer then there wouldn't be anything standing in our way and I could come to you with this big Jim gesture' and show you all at once just how much I love you and how much I really do believe in your future."
15678,"Sorry, how long have you been showing the house?",About 2 months
15679,"I mean, you were gonna do this without me?","Well, you' you bought the house without telling me, so I thought I could sell it without telling you."
15680,Oh' okay. Where would we go?,Austin? Maybe.
15681,Austin? Maybe.,"I promise you, you don't have to do this for me."
15682,"Hold on a second. [turning] Wait, what did you just say?",We wanna buy your house.
15683,You wanna do this?,I wanna do this.
15684,You really want to do this?,I really want to do this!
15685,What? All right!,We're so excited.
15686,"Uh, could I please have your attention? So a year ago, I got my first art commission to paint a mural for Dunder Mifflin and I decided to paint the history of paper',which was just some trees and stuff. And then someone spray painted a bunch of butts on it and I had to start from the beginning. But it all worked out for the best because I think that I've painted the perfect thing which is the history of us. All of us. And this is for you Jim. [applause] And go ahead! [drape drops and everyone cheers]","Everyone, Let's take our picture in front of the mural. Oh, um, I just'I kind of meant just everybody from the office."
15687,What about the honeymoon?,"Oh, the honeymoon can wait till tomorrow. We wanted to hang out with you guys. I mean, when are we all going to be here together again?"
15688,"Oh, the honeymoon can wait till tomorrow. We wanted to hang out with you guys. I mean, when are we all going to be here together again?","Aww, J, P and D. The Three Amigos. Ah, it warms my heart. Hey, what do you say, when I get back from out honeymoon, the three of us have a conference room meeting just for fun? [pause] What is that meaningful look?"
15689,"Aww, J, P and D. The Three Amigos. Ah, it warms my heart. Hey, what do you say, when I get back from out honeymoon, the three of us have a conference room meeting just for fun? [pause] What is that meaningful look?",You know what? Maybe we should talk.
15690,You know what? Maybe we should talk.,"Hey, come here. You guys need to see this."
15691,What is it?,[on the computer] You're probably sitting there wondering what will be your mark. What will you be known for? It might surprise you to learn...
15692,[on the computer] You're probably sitting there wondering what will be your mark. What will you be known for? It might surprise you to learn...,I finally feel ready. Athlead is growing'
15693,"Woah. Right. For what, the art? The music? The incredible nightlife? No thank you. But if you're ever in the area, you'll always have a place to stay'in my barn.",There it is.
15694,"Do I get along with my co-workers? Well, first of all, I don't have co-workers anymore, I have subordinates. So' have I gotten along with my subordinates? Let's see. My supplier relations rep, Meredith Palmer, is the only person I know who knows how to properly head bang to Motorhead. Oscar Martinez, my accountant, is now godfather to my son. Angela Schrute, my former accountant is now my wife. My top salesman, Jim Halpert was best man at my wedding and office administrator Pamela Beesley Halpert is my best friend. So'yes. I'd say I have gotten along with my subordinates.","[on computer] You might feel sorry for me but I actually feel sorry for you. Because you're about to leave Cornell. So say it with me: [all]: Oh, I can so just sit here and cry."
15695,"Hey, Jim, remember flonkerton when you did Office Olympics? It was awesome.",Thanks Phyl.
15696,Do you even have a mattress?,"No, but I still have my medal from that."
15697,Why do you say that?,[sniffles] It's just that I'm so emotional.
15698,"How did you do it? How did you capture what it was really like? How we felt and how made each other laugh and how we got through the day? How did you do it? Also, how do cameras work?","Everyday when I came into work, all I wanted to do was leave. So why in the world does it feel so hard to leave right now?"
15699,"Everyday when I came into work, all I wanted to do was leave. So why in the world does it feel so hard to leave right now?","It all seems so very arbitrary. I applied for a job at this company because they were hiring. I took a desk at the back because it was empty. But'[chuckles] no matter how you get there or where you end up, human beings have this miraculous gift to make that place home. [standing with two cops] Let's do this."
15700,I thought it was weird when you picked us to make a documentary. But all in all I think an ordinary paper company like Dunder Mifflin was a great subject for a documentary. There's a lot of beauty in ordinary things. Isn't that kind of the point?,Dummy
