13,"JP, update on the Morgenthau murder?","Early this morning, someone decided to shoot and kill luxury food importer Harry Morgenthau. Body was discovered by his cleaning lady. During her interview, using expert detective work, I deduced that she had something super gross on her chin. I took a picture of it, as evidence."
14,"Maybe it was just, like, that old person gunk. You know the way they're always covered in gunk? Oldies are gross.","How about we focus on the murder, instead of the old person gunk?"

23,"...I don't even need to add the zip code, or something?",Just got these crime scene photos -- look at the victim's socks.

27,What the hell are you doing?,Fire extinguisher roller chair derby.
28,Is that what you think?,Hey! You must be the new C.O. Detective Jake Peralta. Great to meet you.
29,"That was my speech. Sergeant Jeffords, a word?",I love that guy.
30,"Yeah, he's really suave. Anyone else get kind of a gay vibe?",Sergeant. You were in the 18th with me. Though you were significantly...
31,"Titties. Yes. I remember. I never liked that nickname. Though to be fair, it was accurate. Says here you're on administrative leave?","A year ago, my wife and I had twin baby girls. Cagney and Lacey. Ever since, I've kind of... clenched up. Lost my edge. There was an incident."
32,"What? You always go in first. Look at you -- those biceps don't go in ""second."" ",I think he's dead.
33,You think I can't handle this much hot sauce? I can handle way more than this.,In... your... face.
34,"Absolutely, sir. Where do we start?",We start with him.
35,"Okay. Perp came in through the window, left that muddy footprint, broke that cabinet -- hold on, hold on. Is everyone wearing a necktie? Because it's impossible to solve crimes if you're not wearing a tie.",Shell casings found here. ...Two shots. Bang... bang.
36,"Yeah, he's a little too serious. What do you think, Rosa?",Seems cool.
37,"Looks like the perp stole: a computer, a watch, and a jamon iberico ham, valued at... what?! Six thousand bucks?","A ham for $6000? Is it from a talking pig? Is it made out of ""Babe"
38,"A ham for $6000? Is it from a talking pig? Is it made out of ""Babe","Jamon iberico is an amazing cured ham from Spain. They had it at my uncle's funeral. I gorged myself at that funeral. I was constipated for three days. Rest in peace, Uncle Johnny."
39,A murder and a ham heist? Things just got interesting. This is Captain Ray Holt. We're gonna need some extra ties.,"Speaking of ties, where's yours, Meep-Morp?"
40,"Speaking of ties, where's yours, Meep-Morp?",You gotta be kidding me. Hi Captain! What are you doing here?
41,You gotta be kidding me. Hi Captain! What are you doing here?,I like to know what my detectives are up to. Take Santiago and knock on doors -- see if the neighbors heard anything.
42,Door duty? It's a waste of time.,Diaz and Boyle check in with the coroner. Report back to me in an hour.
43,"Hey, Rosa. I just happened to notice, there's an old movie festival at the Film Forum this week. You want to go?",Sure.
44,"Yeah. I can definitely do that. I'll probably just go with something classic? Like ""Citizen Kane.""","""Citizen Kane"" is terrible. Pick a good movie."
45,What?,Cuba's a weird place. It means
46,The reward is a six-toed prince?!,"Hello, sir -- can we ask you a few questions?"
47,"Hello, sir -- can we ask you a few questions?","Definitely. I'm actually super glad you guys are here. Are you smelling that weed smell? A dude just broke in here, smoked weed, and bolted."
48,"Definitely. I'm actually super glad you guys are here. Are you smelling that weed smell? A dude just broke in here, smoked weed, and bolted.","Yeah, that checks out."
49,What is your name?,My name Brjkolj. B-R-J-K-O-L-J.
50,Have you ever seen this man before? He was shot last night.,Thank you. Brjkolj like.
51,...Sir? That's ours. We need that. And he kept it.,Has anyone in the history of police work ever solved a crime by doing door duty?
52,Has anyone in the history of police work ever solved a crime by doing door duty?,"First of all, yes. Many, many times. Secondly, my dad met my mom doing door duty in Queens."
53,Hello?!,"Hello, sir! My name is Detective Right-All-The-Time, and this is my partner, Detective Terribledetective."
54,We were wondering if you heard anything unusual last night? And are you single?,Yes. But I'm also dying.
55,"So Gina: in my experience, civilian administrators such as yourself often have their ear to the ground. What do Santiago and Peralta have riding on this bet of theirs?","I'll tell you, on six conditions. Number One: you let me use your office to practice m' dance moves. Second--"
56,Just one date?,"He guarantees it'll end in sex. She says it won't. I don't know, though, Jake's got some moves. I'd bet on at least some over-the-clothes action."
57,"First of all, you're kind of over-doing it on the man-scaping. But more importantly, why do you refuse to take my orders seriously, Detective?","Because, sir, if you're wound too tight, you end up like Terry."
58,"There's a middle ground, Detective. Does anyone here know why it's important to me that you dress appropriately? And it has nothing to do with the Patrol Guide.",Guys look good in ties.
59,Show respect for the job. Pride. Confidence? Happiness.,Are we just naming positive things? Rainbows. Kittens. Thanksgiving dinner!
60,Are we just naming positive things? Rainbows. Kittens. Thanksgiving dinner!,Hmm. Four highly-trained detectives and not one of you can solve this simple mystery. I want to be briefed on any new angles. Any questions?
61,Hmm. Four highly-trained detectives and not one of you can solve this simple mystery. I want to be briefed on any new angles. Any questions?,"Well, I was curious whether you thought I was doing too much man-scaping, and apparently you do, so I'm good."
62,"Hey, what about that expensive jamon iber-crap stuff? The perp left a really expensive TV behind, but stole ham? Is there a place near the crime scene that sells it?","Beneficio's might. Their cured meats section is ridiculous. Though, I mainly think of it as a gelato place--"
63,"Okay, Ratko. Just a few questions. Do you recognize him? Henry Morgenthau?",No.
64,"Okay, I'll tell you what happened. He came by and said he had some hams to sell. You knew they were worth a lot of money, so you tried to rob him when he wasn't home. Only he was home, and he fought back, so you shot him. Am I close? Nod your giant caveman head and drool if I'm close.","Oh man, I hate running! Ratko stop! Stop Ratko!"
65,What the hell happened? And what's on your face?,Passion fruit sorbet.
66,"He's seriously assigning me to the records room? Why do we even have a records room? The computer has been invented, right?","You're lucky, man. I wish I could get assigned here full time. You could not be farther from the action."
67,"Sergeant, you know me. I have more arrests than anyone. Can you please tell the captain how dumb it is to lock his best detective in a file cabinet?",Second best.
68,So? What movie did you get tickets to?,"Well, just to be safe, I bought tickets to all of them."
69,"""Just to be safe?"" What does that mean?","I don't know. I didn't want to mess up, because you're sort of... opinionated."
70,"You think I'm opinionated? Okay, here's an opinion for you: you're a bad judge of character and your shirt looks like vomit.",...So we could see North by Northwest--
71,"So, you found something? I like the tie.","I was skeptical, but it really did make a difference in my work. I think I found something interesting in these files. Here, let me show you."
72,"""Ratko"" was a made-up name, but: after looking through a million files, one of which I literally found in a spiderweb, I found a bunch of references to a Serbian thug, street names: ""The Rat"" and ""The Butcher."" Suspect in a few break-ins -- used to hang out at a storage unit near Boerum Park...which has red soil, hence the muddy red footprints on Monganthau's counter. Also, I am freezing. Can I put my pants on now? ","Fine work, Detective. Let's give Peralta a hand, everyone. "
73,"Well, I for one am very excited to be on a stakeout with you, Captain. You know what my fave part of stakeouts is? Patrol guide says: casual dress.",Does he always talk this much?
74,Does he always talk this much?,I just tune it out. It's like a white noise machine.
75,"First off, that's racist. Second of all, you caught the Disco Strangler, right? That dude wrapped a lot of yo-yos around a lot of hookers' necks. Nice collar. But the thing I can't understand is: young superstar detective takes down a serial killer... why'd it take you so long to get your first command?",Because I'm gay.
76,...Seriously?,I'm surprised you didn't know. I don't try to hide it.
77,Why don't you just come to the movies?,No thanks.
78,When did you come out?,"About twenty-five years ago. The NYPD was not ready for an openly gay detective. Then the old guard died, and suddenly, they couldn't wait to show off the fact that they had a high-ranking gay officer. I made captain, but they put me into a public affairs unit. I was a good soldier, helped recruitment... but all I ever wanted was a command. Now, I finally got one, and I'm not going to screw it up."
79,"My God. I have to thank you, Captain, because at this moment, Peralta is feeling humility, for maybe the first time in his life. Aren't you, JP?","Frankly, yes, I am, and Captain, I'm sorry. But also, look, there's Ratko. Humility over. I'm amazing."
80,"Over there is Detective Santiago. And behind you is Captain Holt. Can you believe that? A captain, on a stakeout! He's kind of a hands-on dude. Point is, we have you surrounded -- -- oh my God, I figured out the tie thing! Captain -- hey, I figured it out!","Maybe now's not the best time, Detective."
81,...You ask Ratko what team?,"No, Ratko, shut up. It's important to you because you were kept off that team, and now you're the coach and you want us all to wear the same uniform. Boom. I nailed it."
82,What's wrong with you?,"Never took off the speedo. Huge mistake. It is inside me. Great job, team!"
83,"And what's this all about, Detective?","Oh, the tux? I'm done with work. This is how I dress in my free time."
84,"Oh, the tux? I'm done with work. This is how I dress in my free time.","You did well today, Peralta. But you're going to need a little more humility if you're going to make captain one day."
85,"Him?! If anyone's going to make captain in this bar, it's me. And you, Captain, because you are a captain.","Yeah, I don't want your job. That's the last thing I want."
86,How'd it go with Rosa?,"We will not be seeing a movie. But -- and this is big -- she called me ""sweet."" Sweet's pretty good, right?"
87,"We will not be seeing a movie. But -- and this is big -- she called me ""sweet."" Sweet's pretty good, right?",Sweet's not good. Grow a pair.
88,"Every cop is different. Every precinct is different. But this is the nine-nine. You want to be on this team? You grind it. Get cases, work cases, solve cases. The right way. To the detectives of the nine-nine.","And to Captain Holt...'s best detective, Jake Peralta."
89," Which reminds me, I'm gonna need a new departmentally issued phone. Oh, come on, really? I'm a few minutes late, so you're gonna call me out in front of everyone?"," Good idea. Everyone? Gather round, so I can call out Peralta in front of you."
90," Good idea. Everyone? Gather round, so I can call out Peralta in front of you."," Okay, fine. I was three minutes late. I'm sorry for doing one thing wrong."
91," You also mislabeled the evidence, so that confession is worthless if the sergeant hadn't caught your mistake. Here are three cases with sloppy paperwork. Here are two pictures. One is your locker. The other is a garbage dump in the Philippines. Can you tell which is which?", That one's the dump?
92, That one's the dump?, They're both your locker.
93," So I won't confuse it with ""undies, clean."" Also, who cares about all these rules? I have more felony arrests than any other detective here.", You also have more mice living in your desk than any other detective.
94," Okay, detectives, let's get started. Santiago, where are we with the Jay Street drug bust?"," There are 12 keys of coke unaccounted for, but we just got a warrant to search the dealer's apartment."
95," Oh, that's what he's been drawing. But what are those little round things at the bottom?", That's the butt.
96, The butt?, I assume you have a plan to catch this gentleman.
97," Did you just say ""genital-man""? Because if so, kudos, and yes, I have a plan. I'm gonna plant a decoy squad car as bait. Meanwhile, I'll be waiting in an undercover vehicle here. He's already tagged three U/C vehicles.", He can clearly spot 'em. You should take my minivan.
98, A minivan? A-ha!, You all got a problem with my minivan?
99, You all got a problem with my minivan?," Cause my wife doesn't like it either. She wanted an SUV, but those things roll, man. They roll!"
100," We? You're coming with me? Sir, with all due respect, I don't need backup.", It's not backup. It's babysitting.
101," Oh, look at this. The drug dealer got a B.A. in art history from Brooklyn college. Interesting, huh?", How's that interesting?
102, How's that interesting?," Well, it's surprising because you would think he had studied... drugs."
103," Excuse me. I know I'm just a lowly civilian administrator, but I couldn't help overhearing you're looking for some missing drugs? As it turns out, my friend here, Carlene, is a psychic, and she's ready to help you."," I do palms, tarot, and I have a degree in numerology from the internet."
104," Ugh. Really, Gina? A psychic?"," What? She's the real deal. E.G., last week, she predicted I would have a sensuous encounter with a guy named Mark. And I did."
105," What? She's the real deal. E.G., last week, she predicted I would have a sensuous encounter with a guy named Mark. And I did.", Is anyone here named Mark?
106, Is anyone here named Mark?, You're good.
107," So basically, everyone's first eight guesses in hangman?"," Thank you, Carlene. Your entire life is garbage."
108," So Holt's coming on my stakeout now? I made a mixtape with some very explicit rap on it, and now I can't sing along.", You made a mixtape?
109, You made a mixtape?," Yes, I still listen to cassettes. This guy is all over me. I mean, a Captain on a minor vandalism case? It's insane."
110," Yes, I still listen to cassettes. This guy is all over me. I mean, a Captain on a minor vandalism case? It's insane."," What's insane is how you refuse to get with the program. There is a new sheriff in town, Jake."
111, Hey! What the hell's going on here?, Science experiment. I wanna see what happens if I taser this cantaloupe.
112, Did he let you play your mixtape?, Okay. That's very funny.
113, Rosa. Yes?, She doesn't love you back. She will never love you back.
114," Well, I had to put on my undercover minivan disguise. Say hello to Harvey Norgenbloom, CPA, recently divorced father of two with a dark sexual secret. What's your cover?", Angry Captain.
115," But the sandals define Harvey. He's a sandals guy. [sighs] Captain, why the babysitting? Why are you micromanaging me?", You think I wanna be sitting here with you instead of running my precinct?
116, You think I wanna be sitting here with you instead of running my precinct?, Yes.
117," Oh, hey, Captain. Hi, so I was able to procure that $50 after all, and my offer still stands. Let me do whatever I want, and the $40... That's how much I actually have... is yours. No? Fair enough. I only had 30 anyways. Well, I guess in order to get you to stop micromanaging me, I'm gonna have to get back to the most important piece of police work there is", And I'm anxious to restore my status as a lone wolf. [Howls]
118," Anything else, Detective?"," Yeah, I'm gonna do one more. [Howls] Lone wolf. He's digging me."
119," Hey, Sarge, do you know where we keep the glitter? Just wanna make sure this report for the Captain is extra sparkly."," What are you doing, Peralta?"
120," What are you doing, Peralta?"," Look, if I have to do things his way, I'm gonna do them my way."
121," I'm not scared of him, okay? I'm not scared of anyone. Oh, also, The Tagger drew a penis on your minivan. I'm sorry. Please don't chase after me.", What? There's a penis on my minivan?
122, What? There's a penis on my minivan?," High ceilings, three bedrooms. Why does every perp have a nicer place than I do?"
123," High ceilings, three bedrooms. Why does every perp have a nicer place than I do?", You know what they don't teach you at the academy? It's better to be a criminal.
124, You know what they don't teach you at the academy? It's better to be a criminal.," Oh, no. The cabinets are blue."
125, Where was it?," Baseboard, behind the hamper."
126, What color was the hamper?, Green.
127," Sorry this is taking so long. Still writing up my report. Pretty detailed. Hey, Gina, can you look up what the humidity was about an hour ago and also what moon cycle we're in?"," No, sorry. Don't feel like it, no."
128," Thanks, Gina. And now to you. What's your name?"," My name is Banana Fartman, MD."
129," I don't believe you. Come on, man. Just tell me who you are. I need to fill this thing out perfectly, so my boss will get off my back. Are you a minor? How old are you?", I'm 610. I'm a highlander.
130," Okay, you know what? I'm gonna put that in there. And then you're gonna be tried as an adult highlander. And they're gonna cut your head off. Is that what you want?"," I hate to be the bearer of bad news, but your psychic friend's predictions about the drug case were wrong, which means all of her predictions are wrong."
131, Lady bin?," Laundry basket. Oh, little boo-boo. Can you go be depressed over there? You're bumming out my whole area."
132," Laundry basket. Oh, little boo-boo. Can you go be depressed over there? You're bumming out my whole area."," Baby, I've got some bad news. Someone painted a giant penis on our minivan. No, you cannot have an SUV now. Those things roll, baby. They roll!"
133," I'm not sure how things work here, but does that mean that your career is in my hands?"," Okay, you know what? Yes."
134," Okay, you know what? Yes.", 20.2 kilos. I feel like we could round up to 21.
135, So what are you doing tonight?, Nothing. What about you... are doing tonight?
136, Nothing. What about you... are doing tonight?, Nothing.
137," Deputy Commissioner's son, huh? His decision to target cop cars makes a lot more sense now."," We gotta let him walk, right?"
138," We gotta let him walk, right?"," He defaced nine police vehicles, and you caught him red-handed. Why would you let him walk?"
139," He defaced nine police vehicles, and you caught him red-handed. Why would you let him walk?"," Captain, I did all the work on this perfectly. [pulls up his report] I mean, my report has over 25 pages of meticulous research, diagrams, and maps. I even put an ""About the Author"" section on the back. [flips it to show a dramatic picture of him on the back] I did everything you asked me to do. But this is above my pay grade. You gotta make the call."
140, Has anyone ever told you you look exactly like a statue?, Yes.
141, Who's Rosa?, The woman I--
142, How old are you in this scenario?," Anyway, the point is Holt cares more about whether I ""do my job right"" than whether I have a job at all. So I'm taking suggestions."
143," Don't arrest him. Just smack him. Hard. With a phone book on a body part no one can see, you know what I'm saying?", So you're suggesting police brutality?
144, So you're suggesting police brutality?," Ha, ha, I guess so, yeah. Why?"
145," Ha, ha, I guess so, yeah. Why?"," Hey, Scully."
146, Yeah?," You want this collar? Paperwork's all done, and it's perfect."
147," You want this collar? Paperwork's all done, and it's perfect.", The Podolski kid? Are you kidding? I just gave him my lunch.
148, The Podolski kid? Are you kidding? I just gave him my lunch.," Okay. Boyle, what do you think?"
149," Okay. Boyle, what do you think?"," I don't know, man. I'm lost. The universe is a cruel and vexing puzzle. I-I'm at the whim of the cosmos."
150, Where's my son?," He is at my desk, enjoying a nice glass of bubbly water and some chocolate I was saving for a special occasion."
151," Hey, Peralta, when you're done, can you help me wrap up this massive cocaine bust I just pulled off? Thanks. Oh, Deputy Commissioner, didn't see you there. Sorry for interrupting. Amy Santiago."," Trevor, what'd you do this time?"
152," Trevor, what'd you do this time?", Nothing.
153, So I caught him red-handed doing nothing?, I'm saying maybe it's a possibility you made a mistake.
154," Would you actually mind just checking out my report? It's pretty thorough, and I spent over an hour on fonts. Kinda snazzy, so…"," Oh, thank you. I'll get right to it."
155, What's up with the chair?," Um, Carlene predicted if I get out of this chair, I'd get badly hurt, so I'm not chancing it. Oh, man. There's no more pudding cups left."
156, Ah! What'd you do that for?," There. Now you're hurt in this chair. You can get hurt anywhere, Boyle. And if you do, it won't be because some shoe salesman predicted it. You make your own destiny."
157, Why is there yogurt on this?," The Deputy Commissioner threw my report in Terry's trash can, and he'd been eating yogurt earlier."
158, Terry loves yogurt. Something wrong?," Kinda, yeah. I called six precincts about this kid. He's been brought in a dozen times. Theft, vandalism, drunken disorderly, but he's never been processed. His daddy comes in and bails him out every time. He's a lucky little jerk."
159," No, I wouldn't say he was lucky. I feel bad for this kid. I mean, what kind of father cares so little for his son that he lets him get away with everything? Well, he's someone else's problem now. Like you said, it's out of your hands."," Alright, I see what you're trying to do, but it's not gonna work. I'm not going to arrest him. I'm going to arrest him!"
160, You want backup?, Yes.
161, What is this? You can't do this. Get that thing out of here.," Excuse me, sir. Trevor Podolski, you're under arrest for vandalism and destruction of property."
162," What are you doing? I told you to back off, Peralta."," First off, the name's Santiago, Detective Amy Santiago. Second, I'm arresting your son, which, as I say it aloud, seems like an unwise choice, but it's the one I'm making. Once again, my name is Amy Santiago."
163," You're gonna have to try a little harder if you wanna scare me. I've been an openly gay cop since 1987, so you're not the first superior officer to threaten me. You know how I'm still standing here? Cause I do my job, and I do it right. [walks back to police car]"," Damn, son!"
164, Francois Truffaut's Breathless. What? Terry likes foreign films.," Mm-kay. There is a correct answer to this question, though. So gather around for the greatest cop film of all time. Please refrain from texting during our presentation. [clicks something on his computer and video feed pops up] All right, so there's Hitchcock. And there's an old hooker. There it is!"
165," Hey, love the sweater. Who you slayin' tonight, lady killer?"," Well, we shall see what we shall see."
166," All right, let's get started. Scully. Where are you on digitizing the old case files?"," As of yesterday, I'm officially 1% done."
167, Why are you smiling? That's nothin'.," There's thousands of cases, and for each one, I have to fill out 200 little box thingies on 50 different screens."
168," Ugh, god, Scully. Why are you always telling us about your disgusting body?", I don't see anything.
169, How are you married?," Peralta, where are we on the Adams Street burglary?"
170," Peralta, where are we on the Adams Street burglary?"," We are very close, Captain. Aside from a complete absence of evidence, suspects, or leads. So, in conclusion, not at all close."
171, And the Vickers Street aggravated assault?," Stalled out, and the Calloway robbery also remains unsolved.. Due to a lack of solving it by me."
172, You're not?," I don't slump, people. I opposite slump. I p-muls. That's ""slump"" backwards, and it's what I do. I p-muls all over this bitch."
173," All right, sir. Let me hit you with a little analogy. Are you familiar with racecars?", Formula 1 or Stock?
174, Formula 1 or Stock?," That's already way more than I know about it. The point is, I'm a super-awesome race car who's hit a couple of unlucky speed bumps."
175, You got speed bumps on a race track?," Is that not part of car racing? It should be. All I'm saying is, it's open road again. I'm about to close a case. Missing grandma Helen Sterrino. Last Sunday, her grandson Judd reported she went out for bagels and never came back. [hands report to Holt] This morning, we picked up an old lady matching her description exactly. I showed her pictures of Judd, and she said, and I quote, [imitating old lady] 'That's my grandson.'"

I showed her pictures of Judd, and she said, and I quote, [imitating old lady] 'That's my grandson.'", What did I say about doing voices?
177, What did I say about doing voices?," I'm a storyteller, sir. It's my craft. [takes report back from Holt] Anyways, grandson's coming in. They reunite, and I throw another case on the old ""Solved it"" pile. [puts file on a stack of other files and it falls off his desk] Hey my croissant. [picks up croissant that was under the stacks of papers then bangs it on the desk, showing it's rock solid, and proceeds to eat it]"
178," You wanted to see me, Captain?"," Yes, the D. A. wanted me to personally thank you for your work on the Jay Street drug bust."
179, For praise?, Uh...
180," Hey, Sarge, I need someone to fill out a lineup. Will you be Scary Terry?"," Oh, I love being Scary Terry. He says what regular Terry's thinking."
181, What do you need?," --Color. Okay. You know how, every year, the precinct does that junior police program seminar?"
182," --Color. Okay. You know how, every year, the precinct does that junior police program seminar?", That thing where we try to get a bunch of loser kids to become student snitches?
183, That thing where we try to get a bunch of loser kids to become student snitches?," No, the thing where we try to get at-risk kids--"
184, Snitches. What about it?, Captain specifically asked me to run it this year. I signed you up to do it with me. Here's the info. [handing packet to Rosa]
185, Now I gotta read something?, Greetings. Fine. I guess I can help you with those at-risk kids.
186," What? No, she recognized you. This is Helen.", Who's Helen? Oh! That's my husband. Solomon. [hugs Charles]
187, Who's Helen? Oh! That's my husband. Solomon. [hugs Charles], I'm--I'm not really her husband.
188, You're so much shorter than you used to be. What did the Japanese do to you?, Different generation.
189, Why was your hand in her back pocket?," Well, she told me she didn't have any I.D., and unlike Boyle, my first instinct was not to caress her butt."
190," What? Here's a hypothetical question. Let's say I knew someone that, for the first time in their career, was experiencing, like, a minor slump. What do you think you would suggest to that person if they were going through that?"," Well, I haven't really been in a slump since my divorce. So I'd tell this person, ""Maybe get divorced."" He'd have to get married first."
191," Okay, so the suggestion to beat is get married and then divorced. Rosa?"," Fly to Montreal, hit a classy hotel bar, bone a stranger, slump over."
192," That's a good one. Sarge, what would you do?"," 10,000 sit-ups."
193," Okay, do you have a backup plan in case my hypothetical person can only do 9,500, or 3?", What's going on in here?
194, What's going on in here?, We're helping Jake's friend get out of his slump.
195," Hey, Gina. What are you doing?"," Oh, hi, Amy. Since I have nothing to offer, and since I'm not a cop, I thought I'd just show up and learn."
196, Do you wanna help me out here?," Nah, I think I'm good."
197, Hold up--Why does the kid selling drugs sound like he's black?, He's not.
198," Well, why not? Are you saying that black people can't sell drugs?"," No, I'm not saying that."
199, We have a black president. Why can't black people sell drugs?, I'm so confused.
200," You want some help, big man?"," No! I can do this. It's just driving me a little crazy. Where do I affix the princess tower, Boyle?! Where do I affix it?!"
201," No! I can do this. It's just driving me a little crazy. Where do I affix the princess tower, Boyle?! Where do I affix it?!", On the side of the turret--
202, Why would I swap cases with you? I got multiple calls that a guy in the Sackett Towers is dealing meth out of his apartment. It's a guaranteed arrest.," And therefore will have a ton of paperwork. Which I know you hate. I have a murder here with no leads and no evidence. It's unsolvable, and thus... shall have no paperwork."
203," So, where are you going, Peralta?"," I am on my way to ending the slump. I got a dunker, Captain. Nothin' but net."
204," So you haven't solved any of your old cases, and yet you've taken on a new one. I mean, shouldn't you at least solve this Helen Sterrino missing grandmother case first?"," Or I could solve a super easy one, get my mojo back, and move on to catching The Zodiac Killer. Am I getting ahead of myself?"
205," Or I could solve a super easy one, get my mojo back, and move on to catching The Zodiac Killer. Am I getting ahead of myself?"," No, you are not, Jake Rabbit."
206, So are you! Why am I offended by that?," They don't identify with you because you're not from the streets. I am. Follow, watch, learn. All right, listen up. [rips earbuds out of two girls ears] I know you think you're badasses. But deep down, you're scared. How do I know? Because I've been that same scared kid, and if you don't get your crap together, I'm gonna end up busting you and throwing you in jail. Got it?"
207," They don't identify with you because you're not from the streets. I am. Follow, watch, learn. All right, listen up. [rips earbuds out of two girls ears] I know you think you're badasses. But deep down, you're scared. How do I know? Because I've been that same scared kid, and if you don't get your crap together, I'm gonna end up busting you and throwing you in jail. Got it?"," Remix, yo!"
208, What's happening?, I think they're laughing at you.
209," All right, flute man, who else is in this apartment? Where's the dealer?", I live here alone with my birds.
210," What, you don't think I know this M.O.? These are mules. They're drug mules. They're bird mule drugs. Drug bird mules.", Apartment's clear.
211," No, it isn't, okay? That's just something people say when a bird poops on you to make you feel better because it's terrible."," Fore, comin' in!"
212," Hey, Jake. You busy?"," Yes, I very clearly am busy."
213," Good to know. Can you hand me a paper towel, please, Gina?", There's no more left.
214, Why would I ever eat off his shirt?," Look, sir, I don't know what's going on, but I think I'm cursed."
215," Cursed, huh?"," The freakiest things have been happening to me. I mean, I can't solve a case to save my life. Birds are unloading on me left and right. And, two seconds ago..."
216," Hey, Sarge, do we have any old t-shirts in here?", Cursed.
217," You're benching me? No, no, no, look-- I've got a plan. Give all my open cases to Hitchcock, who's suddenly on a roll, and assign me 20 fresh ones. Eventually, my luck will turn."," No, I don't think that's what's best for you or the squad. Not until this blows over."
218, And how long will that be?," Could be a week, could be a month."
219," I don't know how to connect with these kids. They're mean and shallow and respect nothing. I mean, what kind of person would they even listen to?"," Hitchcock, stop bringing your food in little tupperware containers. It hurts my fingers when I'm trying to open it."
220, What do you want?, --Sweater. Okay. Rosa and I think it would be great if you talked to the kids.
221," Peralta, leave Hitchcock alone! Come here. I got in touch with Smitty. He says that you should rub this rabbit's foot with your left forefinger and your pinky, like this, for good luck. Okay? Now you try it."," Okay. Yep. It's definitely helping. I can feel it. The curse is lifting off of me. Ah, hand cramp!"
222, You okay?, The fairy princess castle has defeated me. I'm a grown man with man hands and a man brain. I should be able to put together a dollhouse in less than four hours. Why does it have to be so hard? Look... This screw has three point sides. And nowhere to screw it in! [screw clatters to floor] And there's wheels. What kind of castle has wheels? [screams as he starts destroying what's left of the castle]
223, The fairy princess castle has defeated me. I'm a grown man with man hands and a man brain. I should be able to put together a dollhouse in less than four hours. Why does it have to be so hard? Look... This screw has three point sides. And nowhere to screw it in! [screw clatters to floor] And there's wheels. What kind of castle has wheels? [screams as he starts destroying what's left of the castle]," 117A. Yes. 117B. Yes. 118A. Wait a minute. Hey, just heading to the can."
224, Hey. What's going on?," Well, I'm not allowed to leave my desk, so we have to meet in here."
225, You know what I'm thinking?, No clubhouse.
226," Children, your problem is not that you're troubled or at-risk or bad dressers. Is that a trucker hat? Still? Come on. Your problem... is that you don't have passion for anything. My life turned around when I found my passion. And today, well I hope to inspire you with it. [clicks to turn on Christina Aguilera's Beautiful and she starts dancing, after a while she shuts off the music and sits on the table] What are we thinking? Yes, in the denim.", I think I speak for everyone when I say your weird dancing was just weird.
227," Fine. Cops make $52,000 a year. You never have to stop at a red light. And you get to carry a gun. Who wants in? Boom, boom, boom, boom, boom. Yes."," Oh, my god. You got eight kids to sign up. How did you know that would work?"
228," Oh, my god. You got eight kids to sign up. How did you know that would work?", That's what made me sign up when I was a kid.
229, You did this program?, Mm-hmm. Yeah. It does not work.
230, Fantastic. Too dramatic?, No.
231, Why are we in the bathroom?," I thought you might ask that, and I will answer in due time. But first, I know what happened to your grandma. Nothing."
232, What are you talking about?," The reason I couldn't find her is because she never existed. I had Detective Boyle make some calls, and it turns out you've done this before. Five missing persons reports in five different states. [hands Mr. Terrino the reports] Recognize this?"
233," The reason I couldn't find her is because she never existed. I had Detective Boyle make some calls, and it turns out you've done this before. Five missing persons reports in five different states. [hands Mr. Terrino the reports] Recognize this?", What are you accusing us of?
234, What are you accusing us of?," Probably insurance fraud. Definitely filing a false report and obstruction of justice. Now, you were wondering why we did this in the bathroom. It's because you're full of crap."
235," Well, the curse is over. The slump is done. Jake is back. Permission to take a selfie of the two of us, sir? [holds out phone in front of both their faces]", Permission denied.
236," So, the rabbit's foot worked, huh?"," Ah, maybe. All I know is my mind was so numb from doing all that boring data entry that my brain kind of rebooted, and I had an inspiration about one of my old cases. [deep breath] And I now see that that was your plan all along. And that you're capable of smiling."
237, You know why Boyle doesn't slump?, Because his whole life is a slump?
238, Because his whole life is a slump?," Because he doesn't let adversity get him down. He keeps grinding. If I'd given you those new cases, the second you hit a snag, you would have spiraled again. You need to stay out of your own head."
239," Okay. But, sir, I don't get it. If that was your plan, why bother with Smitty and the rabbit's foot?"," Well, there's a very good reason for that. I was, uh, I believe the term is, uh... messing with you."
240," Oh, my god. What happened to all the princess flourishes?"," Well, they were destroyed, so I turned it into a princess police station. You know, some jobs take brains, some jobs take muscles, some jobs take dainty little fingers. Did I ever tell you I had to wear a woman's wedding ring?"
241," Well, they were destroyed, so I turned it into a princess police station. You know, some jobs take brains, some jobs take muscles, some jobs take dainty little fingers. Did I ever tell you I had to wear a woman's wedding ring?"," Thank you, Boyle. I appreciate it."
242," Yeah. Speaking of, this is work. Sorry. What's up, Peralta?", Captain called. He needs everybody back. There's a lead on the nightingale strangler.
243, Okay. Where are you?," Apparently has the world's smallest pen1s and doesn't know how to use it... Hi, there, I'm Jake Peralta, Amy's boss. That's not true."
244, What are you doing here?, I'm here on a date. Who is now leaving. Worth it. Have a great night.
245," And with a record five felonies solved in one week, Peralta pulls ahead. Did you guys hear that I solved five felonies in a week?", We heard.
246, Really? How?," Five felonies in one week! Light 'em up, Boyle."
247," Something to share with the rest of us, Santiago?"," No, sir, I wasn't... Peralta was the one that was talking. God, you must have been the worst fourth grader ever."
248," Santiago, anything else?", No.
249, No?, Uh-uh.
250, So you were just borrowing those cars?, Ask about his bank account. Ask about his bank account! Ask him about his bank...
251," Me too. So I have an eyewitness in the purse-snatcher case. Only problem is, the sketch artist is out sick. How do you want me to proceed?"," Figure it out, Santiago. It's your case."
252, Are you bowing?, No. This is how I walk.
253," What do you need, Quasimodo? I gotta go meet with Boyle and Peralta.", Is there something wrong with the Captain? It seems like he's in a bad mood.
254, Is there something wrong with the Captain? It seems like he's in a bad mood., I don't know. Who can tell?
255, I don't know. Who can tell?," You all right, Captain? Tough weekend?"
256," You all right, Captain? Tough weekend?", I went to Barbados with my husband. We wove hats out of Palm fronds and swam with the stingrays. I've never been happier.
257, What do we got?," Sorry, sorry. You're the primary, you're in charge."
258,"What are you thinking, Boyle?", All ri...
259," I'm calling natural causes. We got heart medicine over here, home defibrillator. And a frequent customer gift basket from the cardiac wing of Brooklyn Methodist. This case is open and shut. Just like his mouth was, constantly. That was my last fat joke. Okay? Diaz, check and see if there's any more meds in the bathroom. Boyle, see what you can find in the bedroom. I'll take the kitchen."," Yep, that's exactly what I was gonna say. It's... it's so weird. He's so good at knowing what I'm gonna tell him to do, he just does it. It's weird."
260," Hey, sergeant. You know how you're really good at doodling?"," I know you think you're complimenting me, but calling them doodles is an insult. You a big fan of Picasso's doodles?"
261," I know you think you're complimenting me, but calling them doodles is an insult. You a big fan of Picasso's doodles?", Sorry. Can you please draw a perp for me? The sketch artist is out sick and the Captain wants this done right away. He's in a bad mood.
262, Sorry. Can you please draw a perp for me? The sketch artist is out sick and the Captain wants this done right away. He's in a bad mood., Is he? I can never read him.
263, Is he? I can never read him.," You look chipper, Captain. You have a fun weekend?"
264," You look chipper, Captain. You have a fun weekend?", There was a small fire in my home. I lost many photo albums of treasured memories. I'm devastated.
265, Any signs of forced entry or a struggle?, No.
266, You sure about that? Looks like maybe his belt had a pretty epic struggle with his stomach.," I'm telling you, he and I have a connection and there is something bothering him. Can you help me out?"
267," I'm telling you, he and I have a connection and there is something bothering him. Can you help me out?"," Great. Ma'am, can you please describe the perp to sergeant Jeffords?"
268," Great. Ma'am, can you please describe the perp to sergeant Jeffords?"," Yeah, he had, um, dark, curly hair, and a neck tattoo..."
269," Wait, wait, wait. Slow down. Let's start with the eyes. Were they desperate? Lonely? Did they betray heartache?", They were brown.
270, Do you even want your purse back?, So far you've managed to tell three fat jokes and completely bulldoze Charles. Is that your idea of being a good secondary?
271, So far you've managed to tell three fat jokes and completely bulldoze Charles. Is that your idea of being a good secondary?," First off, I've told four. And second, I'm helping. I mean, I started cataloguing the contents of the fridge, but it turns out there's not enough paper on earth. Five fat jokes. Thanks, Arnie. [Laughs] See, Arnie thinks I'm doing great."
272," I'm so sorry for your loss, Mrs. Patterson. Can you talk about what happened after breakfast?"," I took the dog for a walk. When I came back, he was dead. I'm just in shock. We were going on a cruise together next week. He had pre-purchased the unlimited soda package."
273, You all right?, What's up?
274, What's up?, How's the Patterson case looking?
275, How's the Patterson case looking?," It looks like natural causes, but I'll know for sure once I get the autopsy results tomorrow. Jake volunteered to follow up with the M.E. My man is all over it."
276," Hey, Jake. Have you heard anything from the M.E.? She hasn't sent the autopsy report."," Oh, that's strange. Maybe probably a bunch more people died and she got super busy? That's definitely what happened."
277," Oh, that's strange. Maybe probably a bunch more people died and she got super busy? That's definitely what happened."," Okay, just let me know when she calls. You got it."
278," Hey, can I ask you guys something? Can you keep a secret?", Do you know anything about my life?
279, Do you know anything about my life?," No, I do not. Good point. Okay, so you know the new medical examiner? I kinda had s*x with her last night."
280," No, I do not. Good point. Okay, so you know the new medical examiner? I kinda had s*x with her last night.", What?
281, What?," Oh, sorry, I forgot who I was talking to. s*x is something that two adults do with their bodies when they're attracted to each other."
282," He's right, Santiago. Do you not know that?"," I meant, what were you thinking? She was supposed to be doing an autopsy for your primary, Charles."
283," I meant, what were you thinking? She was supposed to be doing an autopsy for your primary, Charles."," The guy died of natural causes. What's the big deal? Anyways, back to last night. As you would imagine, I'm normally up for pretty much anything in the bedroom, but I can't tell if what happened was weird or sexy."
284," The guy died of natural causes. What's the big deal? Anyways, back to last night. As you would imagine, I'm normally up for pretty much anything in the bedroom, but I can't tell if what happened was weird or sexy.", Wait. Close your eyes.
285, What are you doing?, rI like 'em cold.
286, Cold? Like a dead guy?, You're reading into that.
287, Am I?, You have a really nice chest.
288," All right. Wait, that's bad, right?"," Yeah, it is. Oh, no."
289," Oh, what do we have here?", A 34-year-old caucasian male who is dead. Very dead.
290, Mmm. Cause of death?, Initial assessment
291, But what do I find when I probe a little farther?, Bruising around the neck. And ocean water in the lungs.
292," Ooh, how long have you been dead, body?", Four days.
293," Rosa, what's your call? Weird or sexy?", Weird.
294, I knew it. But also kinda sexy?," No. Weird. But more importantly, that's what you were doing while Charles was grinding through paperwork?"
295," No. Weird. But more importantly, that's what you were doing while Charles was grinding through paperwork?"," Told ya. Worst secondary in the unit. What do you guys want from me? You know, I take over a crime scene, I'm a bad secondary. I blow off work to have s*x with a hot coroner, I'm a bad secondary. I can't win."
296," Told ya. Worst secondary in the unit. What do you guys want from me? You know, I take over a crime scene, I'm a bad secondary. I blow off work to have s*x with a hot coroner, I'm a bad secondary. I can't win.", What are you guys talking about?
297, What are you guys talking about?," Um, just weird s*x stuff that has nothing to do with work."
298," Sarge, all of these are fine. How much longer are you gonna work on this?", It's questions like that that made Van Gogh cut off his ear. You can't put a clock on art. Ten minutes.
299," Well, how do you even know he's in a bad mood? I mean, it's impossible to read that guy."," This is the most incompetent, worthless report I have ever read in my life! Get your act together or, so help me God, you won't live to see retirement!"
300," It's like, ""what's that guy thinking?"" You know?"," I can read him. And if anyone can figure out what's bothering him, it's me. He and I are exactly the same. Except that I'm younger, Cuban, female, single, and straight."
301, Captain Holt's not gay. Captain Holt's gay?," Seriously, man, just retire."
302," Boyle, where's my paperwork on that DOA? Still waiting on the autopsy report. Supposed to come in first thing this morning, but so far, nothing.", This is unacceptable. I'll call the M.E. and find out what happened.
303," Rosa, can I show you something? What's up? Patterson's wife told me that they were going on a cruise together next month, but her credit card bill shows only one ticket booked. Either she's lying or she knew he was gonna die."," Huh, nice find, Boyle."
304, This could be a murder. Where's that autopsy? Jake went down to the M.E. an hour and a half ago. He still hasn't got back to me., Jake went to get the autopsy report?
305, Jake went to get the autopsy report?," I know. Isn't he the best? I mean, he's really coming into his own as a secondary. I wanna get him something nice. Does he come across more as a Pinot guy or more of a Shiraz?"
306," I know. Isn't he the best? I mean, he's really coming into his own as a secondary. I wanna get him something nice. Does he come across more as a Pinot guy or more of a Shiraz?", You know what? We better go down there. See what's holding him up.
307, You know what? We better go down there. See what's holding him up., Good call.
308," Huh. So it is. Well, how can I help you?"," Uh, we came by to get that autopsy report. Hmm. Is Detective Peralta here? I haven't seen him. Thanks for coming by."
309," Uh, we came by to get that autopsy report. Hmm. Is Detective Peralta here? I haven't seen him. Thanks for coming by.", Hold on. Found him.
310," Ah, thank goodness you're here. I am so lost. Do you know where the vending machines are?"," Look, it's not what it seems like. Yes, it is. Yes, it is. Here's what happened. I came down here to get the autopsy report and in conclusion, here we are. Now if you'll excuse me..."
311," Wait, like a murder murder, or, like, his mouth murdered him by making him eat so much food that his heart exploded?", Murder murder.
312," You guys have been down here for two hours. What, did you have s*x 40 times?"," 40 times? No, Charles, like... Look, I'm sorry. We didn't know it was a homicide."
313," 40 times? No, Charles, like... Look, I'm sorry. We didn't know it was a homicide."," Well, it shouldn't matter. I'm your primary and I asked you to do something. So if it's okay, I'd like to be upset with you."
314," It's more than okay. It's okay times two. Now, Dr. Rossi, will you please perform the autopsy for us right now?"," Actually, with a body this size, I'd need my assistant, and I gave him the rest of the afternoon off when Jake showed up."
315," Guilty. Okay, fine. I will act as your assistant because I am a wonderful secondary. How gross could it be?", Just gonna need you to hold open this chest cavity for me.
316," Yep, there are some signs of stress on the heart, but that's not surprising. Oh, will you look at that stomach lining? God, that is just a beaut.", Ugh.
317, Caught him?," Yes, sir. He was easy to pick up. He looked just like the sergeant's sketch."
318, You think I should draw caricatures? That's garbage art! I don't draw giant-head people on surfboards!, I'm saying you could. You're that good.
319," Sarge, I need you to do one more drawing for me. What? It'll cheer the Captain up. He'll be over the moon. He may even lean back in his chair a little and nod slightly."," This is a lot of pressure. If I'm gonna do this, it has to be done right. Scully, get me my oils."
320, Paint or massage? I'll get both.," You know, this is one of the most unhealthy people I've ever seen. It's like cutting into a big, overstuffed ravioli. Sure you want me to keep digging?"
321," You know, this is one of the most unhealthy people I've ever seen. It's like cutting into a big, overstuffed ravioli. Sure you want me to keep digging?"," Unfortunately, yes. If the primary on this case says it's a murder, we have to treat it like a murder."
322, Okay. Here we go. Oh. Wanna see something cool?, No.
323," You know what that was? That was the air releasing from the large intestine. [Sighs] In the biz, we call that ""the death bubble."" It's pretty cool. Here, you wanna hold it?", No!
324," But you would have me hang a baroque oil painting of myself like I'm a north Korean dictator. What? No ornate gold frame? Why am I not astride my noble steed, clad in armor? We could add a horse. You just wasted your time, Terry's time, and now my time on this when you should have been filing a report on the purse-snatcher."," Oh, I did. It's already in the system."
325," Nope. Sorry. The spell has worn off. No more weird dead guy s*x for me ever again. It's nothing personal, I just think s*x is for the living. Isn't that right, buddy? Oh, my God, he has no eyes! Oh, that is terrifying."," What now, Santiago?"
326," What now, Santiago?", I figured out why you've been so tense. You're worried about the monthly crime statistics.
327," Noted. My only question is, why'd you do it?"," Um, he drove me to it. He had affair after affair. He was a real don Juan."
328, Permission to make a fat joke?, Granted.
329," Are you sure you didn't mean ""don flan""? Thanks."," Nice. Mrs. Patterson, you are under arrest for the murder of your husband."
330," I agree, it is a wonderful moment. What a wonderful moment. Rosa, do you agree?", It's all right. It's all right
331, You sure you're not just sneaking off for more weird dead guy s*x?," We will never speak of that again. Never. Okay, bye."
332," God. Crazy day, huh?", I hate small talk. Let's drink in silence.
