I've never had one...I never bought one, I never needed one, I've never been in a situation, when I thought to myself I could use a cotton-ball right now. I can certainly get out of this mess. Women need them and they don't need one or two, they need thousands of them, they need bags, they're like peat moss bags, have you ever seen these giant bags? They're huge and two days later, they're out, they're gone, the, the bag is empty, where are the cotton-balls, ladies? What are you doin with them?

69,Guess who?,"Hey, hey."

82,"I swear, I have absolutely no idea what women are thinking. I don't get it, okay? I, I, I admit, I, I'm not getting the signals. I am not getting it! Women, they're so subtle, their little...everything they do is subtle. Men are not subtle, we are obvious. Women know what men want, men know what men want, what do we want? We want women, that's it! It's the only thing we know for sure, it really is. We want women. How do we get them? Oh, we don't know bout that, we don't know. The next step after that we have no idea. This is why you see men honking car-horns, yelling from construction sites. These are the best ideas we've had so far. The car-horn honk, is that a beauty? Have you seen men doing this? What is this? The man is in the car, the woman walks by the front of the car, he honks. E-eeehh, eehhh, eehhh! This man is out of ideas. How does it...? E-e-e-eeeehhhh! I don't think she likes me. The amazing thing is, that we still get women, don't we? Men, I mean, men are with women. You see men with women. How are men getting women, many people wonder. Let me tell you a little bit about our organization. Wherever women are, we have a man working on the situation right now. Now, he may not be our best man, okay, we have a lot of areas to cover, but someone from our staff is on the scene. That's why, I think, men get frustrated, when we see women reading articles, like Where to meet men? We're here, we are everywhere. We're honking our horns to serve you better.","So, I'm on line at the supermarket. Two women in front of me. One of them, her total was eight dollars, the other three dollars.

I have noticed that women are very fast with cheques, yknow, 'cause they write out so many cheques. The keys, they can never find in their purse, they don't know where that is, but the cheque book they got that. They never fumble for the cheque book. The cheque book comes out of a holster  Who do I make it out to? There's my I'D. There's something about a cheque that, to a man, is not masculine. I don't know exactly what it is. I think to a man, a cheque is like a note from your mother that says, I don't have any money, but if you'll contact these people, I'm sure they'll stick up for me... If you just trust me this one time- I don't have any money but I have these. I wrote on these. Is this of any value at all?",What's that one?

336,"That, or Who's bra is this?",That is worse.
337,"So, I'm thinking, as she's saying this, I'm thinking great, the relationships over. But the egg salads on the way. So now I have a decision Do I walk or do I eat?",Hm. You ate.
338,"Someone says, Get out of my life, and that doesn't affect your appetite?",Have you ever had their egg salad?
339,Have you ever had their egg salad?,It is unbelievable.
340,It's unbelievable. You know what else is unbelievable? I picked up the check. She didn't even offer. She ended it. The least she could do is send me off with a sandwich.,How much could you possibly have in there?
341,How much could you possibly have in there?,It's my money. What should I do? Throw it out the window? I know a guy who took his vacation on his change.

352,"You want me to roll six thousand of these?! What, should I quit my job?!","No, I do not like the bank. I've heard the expression Laughing all the way to the bank. I have never seen anyone actually doing it. And those bank lines. I hate it when there's nobody on the line at all, you know that part, you go to the bank, it's empty and you still have to go through the little maze. Can you get a little piece of cheese for me? I'm almost at the front. I'd like a reward for this please."
353,"No, I do not like the bank. I've heard the expression Laughing all the way to the bank. I have never seen anyone actually doing it. And those bank lines.

357,"Well, then I'm not going to the game either. Okay? I'll give him both tickets.","Oh geeeee. Go, go!"
358,He was really crying?,"I had to give him a tissue. In fact, let me call his machine now and I'll just make up some excuse why I can't go to the game either."
359,"Wait a minute. Wait a minute. As long as you're going to lie to the guy, why don't you tell him that you lost both of the tickets, then we can go?","George, the man wept."
360,This is the thing where you go and you have to make your own pizza?,"Yeah, we give you the dough, you smash it, you pound it, you fling it in the air. And then you get to put your sauce and you get to sprinkle your cheese, and then- you slide it into the oven."
361,All of it. You want to invest?,My moneys all tied up in change right now.
362,Trapezoid?,I know. I'm really running out of excuses with this guy. I need some kind of excuse rolodex.

365,What are we gonna do there? Talk?,We could talk.
366,"Oh, what is this?","It's a list of excuses, it's for that guy, Horneck, who's at the game tonight with my tickets. I have that list now so in case he calls, I just consult it and I don't have to see him. I need it. What are you doing?"
367,"It's a list of excuses, it's for that guy, Horneck, who's at the game tonight with my tickets. I have that list now so in case he calls, I just consult it and I don't have to see him. I need it. What are you doing?",I got some for you.
368,"I'm Dan. Can I have my list back, please?","Here, here. Jerry Seinfeld, I cannot believe you're doing this. This is absolutely infantile."
369,What can I do?,Deal with it. Be a man!
370,You made a man cry? I've never made a man cry. I even kicked a guy in the groin once and he didn't cry. I got the cab.,Couple of tough monkeys.
371,Game?,Knick game. Horneck took me. We we're sitting two rows behind the bench. We're getting hit by sweat!
372,Wait. How does Horneck know you?,"Last week. When I, you know, gave you the phone. He's really into my pizza place idea!"
373,"Wait, what pizza place idea?","Oh, no."
374,"Okay, who wants meatloaf?",No thanks.
375,"So, I though you we're tutoring your nephew?","Oh, we finished early."
376,"M-hm, I'll bet. So, are you going to introduce me to your nephew?","Elaine Benes, this is Joel Horneck."
377,"Whoa, Nelson! This is Elaine? I though you guys split?",We're still friends.
378,"So, thanks again for those tickets. But next week, I'm going to take you. How about next Tuesday night?  And why don't you come along?","Oh, no no. Tuesdays uh no good becasue we've got choir practice."
379,What about Thursday night? I mean they're playing the Sonics.,Huh... Thursday is no good because we've got to get to the hospital to see if we qualify as those organ donors.
380,"Forty-one home games. Let's see saturday night we've got the Mavericks. If you don't like the Mavericks, next Tuesday Lakers. I mean, you gotta like Magic, right? Let's see, on the road, on the road, on the road, on the road, back on the fourteenth. They play the Bulls. You can't miss Air Jordan...","You know, I really... I've come to the conclusion that there are certain friends in your life that they're just always your friends, and you have to accept it. You see them, you don't really wanna see them. You don't call them, they call you. You don't call back, they call again. The only way to get through talking with people that you don't really have anything in common with is to pretend you're hosting your own little talk show. This is what I do. You pretend there's a little desk around you. The only problem with this is there's no way you can say, Hey, it's been great having you on the show. We're out of time."
381,"Went out to dinner the other night. Check came at the end of the meal, as it always does. Never liked the check at the end of the meal system, because moneys a very different thing before and after you eat. Before you eat, money has no value. And you don't care about money when you're hungry. You sit down at a restaurant, you're like the ruler of an empire. More drinks, appetizers, quickly, quickly! It will be the greatest meal of our lives. Then after the meal, you know, you've got the pants open, you've got the napkins destroyed, cigarette butt in the mashed potatoes. Then the check comes at that moment. People are always upset, you know. They're mystified by the check. What is this? How could this be? They start passing it around the table, Does this look right to you? We're not hungry now. Why are we buying all this food?",I think Superman probably has a very good sense of humor.
382,Why? Why would that one area of his mind not be affected by the yellow sun of Earth?,I don't know. But he ain't funny.
383,Pardon?,"I dropped a grape in the kitchen and it disappeared. I couldn't find it. I was, I was literally on my knees for ten minutes looking for this stupid grape. I have no idea where it went."
384,"We're you crying? I mean, it's just a grape. You'll find it.","No, I'm just getting over an allergy attack. This guy I'm going out with..."
385,"Oh, no. No no no no no. I'd have to advise against that. What, do you know this woman a month? Let's see, you're going to be with her seventy-two hours. That's a dating decathlon.","Hey, why don't you take her to that place in Vermont I was telling you about? You know, that really charming place with the separate faucets for the hot and cold. She'll love it."
386,"Hey, why don't you take her to that place in Vermont I was telling you about? You know, that really charming place with the separate faucets for the hot and cold. She'll love it.","That's exquisite. Listen, uh, if it's not too much trouble, could you pass me that paper over there?"
387,"That's exquisite. Listen, uh, if it's not too much trouble, could you pass me that paper over there?","You better find that grape before it mutates into another life form. There was once a mutant grape that terrorized an entire town in the Texas panhandle. They brought in the army, nobody could stop it. Apparently it had a pit of steel."
388,Up again?! This is incredible! I'm.. I'm getting it.,You're getting what?
389,You're getting what?,A stock.
390,What stock?,"Did you ever meet my friend, Simons?"
391,"Did you ever meet my friend, Simons?",Maybe.
392,How highs it suppose to go?,"I don't know. But Simons said that if I wanted to get involved, that Wilkinson would tell me the exact right minute to sell. You wanna do it?"
393,"I don't know. But Simons said that if I wanted to get involved, that Wilkinson would tell me the exact right minute to sell. You wanna do it?",Boy... I don't know.
394,What kind of company is it?,It's called Sendrax. They've got some new kind of technique for televising opera.
395,Televising opera?,Some sort of electronic thingy.
396,"Well, how much are you going to invest?",Five thousand... Ten. Ten thousand. Five thousand.
397,What if I lose it?,"Cmon, go for twenty-five hundred. We'll do it together. Come on, come on. We're in it together."
398,"Yeah, can I take your order?",Check the raiser.
399,My bet? All right. I'll open with a tuna sandwich.,Tuna?
400,Tuna?,"Oh, the dolphin thing?"
401,"Oh, the dolphin thing?",They're dying in the nets.
402,"Jerry, can't you incorporate one unselfish act in your daily routine?","Hey, when I'm driving, I let people in ahead of me all the time. I'm always waving everybody in. Go ahead, go ahead, go ahead. ...All right. All right. I'll have a chicken salad."
403,Okay. What about you?,I'll have the tuna.
404,Why didn't you do something?,"What do you want me to do? I gave the guy the half-turn. Then I gave him the full-turn with the eye roll. I mean, beyond that, I'm risking a punch in the mouth. Excuse me, do you have these in the puffs?"
405,"What do you want me to do? I gave the guy the half-turn. Then I gave him the full-turn with the eye roll. I mean, beyond that, I'm risking a punch in the mouth. Excuse me, do you have these in the puffs?",No puffs. Just flakes.
406,Have you thought any more about that trip?,"Yeah, I've been thinking about it."
407,"Oh, so you want to move our relationship into Phase Two?","Exactly. I love Phase Two. Extra toothbrushes, increased phone call frequency, walking around naked. You know, the presents get a lot better in Phase Two."
408,Really? Could we go fishing up there?,"Yeah. We can fish. What? Blues, carp, marlin?"
409,"Yeah. We can fish. What? Blues, carp, marlin?",They have marlin in Vermont?
410,They have marlin in Vermont?,"Oh, big fighting marlin."
411,Is that my paper?,"Bad news, my friend."
412,What? What news?,Sendrax.
413,"Oh, cmon! It's down again?!",Two and a half points.
414,"There's one thing I don't understand. Why does it please you?  George Costanza, please.","Hey, I don't care. I'm just telling you to  get rid of that stock, now!"
415,"George, what's going on?!","Sell it, just say I'm selling!"
416,"Well, where is the guy?!... Nothing?! Almost half my moneys gone... Well, call me right back. Nobody can reach Wilkinson. He hasn't been home or in his office in the past three days!","You know, I can't believe you put your money in that Sendrax. And you could've invested in my roll-out tie dispenser."
417,Roll-out tie dispenser? What was that one?,"Okay, you're in a restaurant. You've got a very big meeting coming up..."
418,"Hey, where, where are you going? You gonna take a trip? The map... what...","Yeah, I'm going to Vermont with uh Vanessa for a few days."
419,"Hey, can I use your place? I got a bunch of friends coming over this weekend.",What friends?
420,What friends?,"Well, it's just some people I met at a rock concert. Do you mind if they use your bed?  'Cause they're really good people, Jerry. I'm telling you. You know, they're anarchists. They're.. they're.. they're.. huge."
421,"Well, it's just some people I met at a rock concert. Do you mind if they use your bed?  'Cause they're really good people, Jerry. I'm telling you. You know, they're anarchists. They're.. they're.. they're.. huge.","George- What?! You're kidding... Well, what's wrong?... So, what are we gonna do?... Great!... All right, I'll speak to you later. Wilkinson, the guy who's supposed to tell us when to sell the stock, he's in the hospital."
422,"George- What?! You're kidding... Well, what's wrong?... So, what are we gonna do?... Great!... All right, I'll speak to you later. Wilkinson, the guy who's supposed to tell us when to sell the stock, he's in the hospital.",So you don't know what's wrong with him?
423,So you don't know what's wrong with him?,All Simons was able to find out is that he's in the hospital.
424,"Okay, fine. Has Simons been in touch with him?","Of course he's been in touch with him. He's left two messages. He just hasn't heard back yet, that's all."
425,Where?,To the hospital.

429,"So what? I'll start talking to him, you know, casual, and I'll work my way around to it.","What if he's in an iron lung or something? What are you gonna do?  How you feeling, Mr. Wilkinson?  By the way, what's happening with Sendrax?"
430,"What if he's in an iron lung or something? What are you gonna do?  How you feeling, Mr. Wilkinson?  By the way, what's happening with Sendrax?",Maybe he's resting.
431,Who goes to the hospital to rest?,"What are you, a doctor?"
432,"What are you, a doctor?","Okay, fine, fine. When are you going down there?"
433,"Okay, fine, fine. When are you going down there?",Today. I'm going today. Just don't do anything until you hear from me.
434,May I help you?,Yeah. I picked up this shirt here yesterday. It's completely shrunk. There's absolutely no way I can wear it.
435,When did you bring it in?,What's the difference? Look at it! Do you see the size of this shirt?!
436,What's the difference? Look at it! Do you see the size of this shirt?!,You got a receipt?
437,You got a receipt?,I can't find the receipt.
438,"Look, forget about the receipt, all right? Even if I had the receipt- look at it! It's a hand puppet. What am I gonna do with this?!","Yes, but how do I know we did the shirt?"
439,"Yes, but how do I know we did the shirt?","What do you think this is a little scam I have? I take this tiny shirt all over the city conning dry cleaners out of money? In fact, forget the money. I don't even want the money. I just once, I would like to hear a dry cleaner admit that something was their fault. That's what I want. I want an admission of guilt."
440,"What do you think this is a little scam I have? I take this tiny shirt all over the city conning dry cleaners out of money? In fact, forget the money. I don't even want the money. I just once, I would like to hear a dry cleaner admit that something was their fault. That's what I want. I want an admission of guilt.",Maybe you asked for it to be washed.
441,"Let me explain to you something, okay? With certain types of fabrics, different chemicals can react, causing-",You shrunk it! You know you shrunk it! Just tell me that you shrunk it!
442,"I think the only reason we go to the dry cleaner is so I can say to the dry cleaner, Well, it's ruined. And of course, the dry cleaner can respond, It's not our fault. We're not responsible. We just ruin the clothes. That ends our legal obligation. You see, the whole problem with dry cleaning is that we all believe that this is actually possible. Th-Right? They're cleaning our clothes, but they're not getting anything wet. It's all dry. I know there's gotta be some liquids back there, some fluids that they're using. There's no such thing as dry cleaning. When you get something on your shirt, ever get something on your shirt and try to get it off like that  That's dry cleaning. I don't think that's what they're doing back there. They don't have eighty guys going, Come on, hurry up! There's a lot of shirts today!",Bless you.
443,"Thank you. What evidence is there that cats are so smart, anyway? Huh? What do they do? Because they're clean? I am sorry. My Uncle Pete showers four times a day and he can't count to ten, so don't give me hygiene.",So what are you gonna do?
444,So what are you gonna do?,"I don't know. I can't think of any solution, unless of course they should meet with some unfortunate accident. What do you think a hit man would charge to rub out a couple of cats?"
445,"I don't know. I can't think of any solution, unless of course they should meet with some unfortunate accident. What do you think a hit man would charge to rub out a couple of cats?","Well, it couldn't be too expensive. Thirteen, fourteen bucks a cat?"

447,"What do you think, Jerry? You wanna make twenty-eight bucks?",I'm no cat killer.
448,How about we go over there right now and we shave them?,"I'd really like to go, Elaine. But, George is coming back from the hospital. I gotta wait for him. But otherwise I would definitely go."

450,How much are you down altogether?,I don't know.. fifteen hundred dollars.
451,"You don't have to say Wow. I know it's Wow. And there's that smile again. Well, what is that?  It's George.","Oh, look at this one by the bus stop. Jerry, come here. Take a look at this."
452,What? What? Did you go down there?  Did he tell you what's gonna happen?  How long we're you there?,Fifteen seconds.
453,You told him you knew Simons?,"Yeah, I mentioned Simons. Next thing I know, I'm in the parking lot. Perhaps they had some sort of a falling out. I'll tell you one thing. I don't know what he's got. But for a sick guy, he's very strong."
454,"Didn't work, huh?",Not quite.
455,"We-Well, what are you gonna do about the stock?",I'm keeping it. I'm going down with the ship.
456,Oh God. Get me out of here. What a mistake. What made me think this would work? And I've still got another day! I've got nothing left to say. Wait... wait... Got one. That's a nice watch. Do you wind it?,"No, it's got a little battery."
457,"Well, the drive home should be a delight. I'm speeding the whole way. Let them throw me in jail. I don't care. That's the manager? Do you want me to see if we can get another room?","No, it's okay."
458,"So, I guess you don't find the separate faucets for the hot and cold, charming?",Not especially.
459,"Well, what do you want to do this afternoon?",What can we do? It's raining.
460,What can we do? It's raining.,We cold play Sorry! We cold play Steal the Old Mans Bundle. Maybe I can get an extension cord and hang myself. What kind of perfume is that you're wearing?
461,We cold play Sorry! We cold play Steal the Old Mans Bundle. Maybe I can get an extension cord and hang myself. What kind of perfume is that you're wearing?,"Oh, you've never heard of it."
462,"No, what? What kind is it?",I can't tell you.
463,"Yeah, that's normal. Excuse me, sir. Could I have a look at that business section?",That stock? I thought you got out of that?
464,That stock? I thought you got out of that?,I did. I'm just curious. It's been almost a week. I want to check it out. Six points?  It's up six points!
465,I did. I'm just curious. It's been almost a week. I want to check it out. Six points?  It's up six points!,I told you not to sell.
466,I said the market fluctuates. Remember?,"Look, Vanessa, of course the market fluctuates. Everybody knows that. I just got fluctuated out of four thousand dollars!"
467,What?,Forget it.
468,"No, what? That's probably why..","That's probably why we're staying here, because you lost money on the stock."
469,"So, what am I looking at here? Twenty-nine hours to go. Well, at least I got plenty of time to find out the name of that perfume...","Have something else. Cmon, have a little dessert?"
470,"Have something else. Cmon, have a little dessert?","I'm good, thanks."
471,"She's full. So, Big Daddy. I'm just curious. How much did you clear on your little transaction there, all told?",I don't like to discuss figures.
472,How much?,"I don't know, what? Eight thousand. It's a Hyundai. Get out of here. I told you not to sell. Simons made money, Wilkinson cleaned up."
473,"I don't know, what? Eight thousand. It's a Hyundai. Get out of here. I told you not to sell. Simons made money, Wilkinson cleaned up.","So, Wilkinsons out of the hospital now?"
474,"So, Wilkinsons out of the hospital now?",No. You'd be surprised. You don't recover that quickly from a nose job.
475,Is that still from the cats?,"No, I just have a cold."
476,"So, what ever happened with that?",I gave him an ultimatum.
477,He chose the cats?,They're very clean animals.
478,Superman can go back in time?,We went over that.
479,A robot butcher?,"Shhhhh. If you want to get in, there's very little time. Sweetheart.. No, no, no. That ought to cover it. Just a second. Just a... let me jus-peek... Come on, come on, come on..."
480,"I'm not an investor. People always tell me, you should have your money working for you. I've decided I'll do the work. I'm gonna let the money relax. You know what I mean?

493,Did you get a haircut?,"No, shower. So, where are we eating?"
494,"No, shower. So, where are we eating?","Tell me if you think this is strange. There's this guy who lives in my building, who I was introduced to a couple of years ago by a friend. He's a uh teacher, or something. Anyway, after we met, whenever we'd run into each other on the street, or in the lobby, or whatever, we would stop and we would chat a little. Nothing much. Little pleasantries. He's a nice guy, he's got a family. Then after a while, I noticed there was not more stopping. Just saying hello and continuing on our way. And then the verbal hellos stopped, and we just went into these little sort of nods of recognition. So, fine. I figure, that's where this relationship is finally gonna settle polite nodding. Then one day, he doesn't nod. Like I don't exist?! He went from nods to nothing."

496,Really?,Yes.
497,You would do that?,If I was a different person.
498,"Hello... Hello. Is Glen there?... I'm sorry. Is this 805-555-3234?... Yes, I know I have the wrong number, but I just want to know if I dialed wrong or if...",Come on up.
499,"Oh, it's you again. See, now if you had answered me, I wouldn't have had to do this. Now that's two long distance calls I made to you why can't you... Why? Why do they just hang up like that? Thank you very much.",Taste this.
500,Uh-huh. It's good?,It's very good.
501,"Good, huh?",Good.
502,"I'm not pulling a shopping cart. What, am I suppose to wear a kerchief? Put stockings on and roll em down below my knee?","See, the other thing is, if you don't like anything, he takes it right back."
503,You did it? What happened?,I told her. In the kitchen  which was risky 'cause it's near all the knives. I started with the word Listen.
504,I liked Marlene. What's her number?,"Uh, no, I, I don't think so."
505,Could you stop that smacking?,"George, I want you to taste this cantaloupe."
506,It's very good cantaloupe. So that's it? You're out?,"Except for one small problem. Hah, I left some books in her apartment."
507,So forget about the books. Did you read them?,"Well, yeah."
508,What do you need them for?,I don't know. They're books.
509,What is this obsession people have with books? They put them in their houses like they're trophies. What do you need it for after you read it?,They're my books.
510,So you want me to get the books? Is that it?,"...so, it must've been ninety-five degrees that night, and everyones just standing around the pool with little drinks in their hands. I was wearing my old jeans and t-shirt. And I don't know, I was just in one of those moods. So I said to myself, Marlene, just do it. And I jumped in. And as I'm getting out, I feel all these eyes on me, and I look up and everyone is just staring at me."
511,So what'd you do?,"Well, nothing. It's no skin off my hide if people like to look. I just didn't see what the big attraction was."
512,"No, no. It's not your fault. Books, books, I need my books. Have you re-read those books yet, by the way? You know the great thing? When you read Moby Dick the second time, Ahab and the whale become good friends. You know, it's not like Marlenes a bad person or anything, but, my God! I mean, we've had like three lunches and a movie, and she never stops calling. And it's these meaningless, purposeless, blather calls. She never asks if I'm busy or anything. I just pick up the phone, and she's in the middle of a sentence!",It's standard. Has she left you one of those messages where she uses up the whole machine?
513,It's standard. Has she left you one of those messages where she uses up the whole machine?,"Ohh! You know, and sometimes she'll go,  Hello, Jerry? And I'll go, Oh, hi Marlene. And then it's Jerry..."
514,"Ohh! You know, and sometimes she'll go,  Hello, Jerry? And I'll go, Oh, hi Marlene. And then it's Jerry...",I dunno sometimes...
515,What trying to get off the phone?,"Ohhhh! You can't! It's impossible! There's no break in the conversation where you can go, All right then... You know, it just goes on and on and on without a break in the wall. I mean, I gotta put a stop to this."
516,Just do it like a Band-Aid. One motion. Right off!  She is sexy though. Don't you think?,"Yeah. Yes, she is."
517,Mr. Costanza?,Yeah.
518,"Yeah, doctor. I'm going to have to wait in that little room all by myself, aren't I?  I better take this. I hate the little room. Oh, hello, Doctor.","The waiting room. I hate when they make you wait in the room. 'Cause it says Waiting Room. There's no chance of not waiting. 'Cause they call it the waiting room, they're gonna use it. They've got it. It's all set up for you to wait. And you sit there, you know, and you've got your little magazine. You pretend you're reading it, but you're really looking at the other people. You know, you're thinking about about them. Things like, I wonder what he's got. As soon as she goes, I'm getting her magazine. And then, they finally call you and it's a very exciting moment. They finally call you, and you stand up and you kinda look around at the other people in the room. Well, I guess I've been chosen. I'll see you all later. You know, so you think you're going to see the doctor, but you're not, are you? No. You're going into the next waiting room  the littler waiting room. But if they are, you know, doing some sort of medical thing to you, you want to be in the smallest room that they have, I think. You don't wnat to be in the largest room that they have. You know what I mean? You ever see these operating theaters, that they have, with like, stadium seating? You don't want them doing anything to you that makes other doctors go, I have to see this!

529,Does George know?,"No, he'd go nuts."
530,"Man, I don't understand people. I mean, why would George want to deprive you of pleasure? Is it just me?","It's partially you, yeah."
531,You're his friend. Better that she should sleep with someone else? Some jerk that he doesn't even know?,"Well, he can't kill me, right?"
532,"Well, he can't kill me, right?",You're a human being.
533,Right. Exactly. So I imagine at some point somebodys going to offer me some cantaloupe?,Nope. No good.
534,Really? That guy who stopped saying hello?,Yes.
535,You talked to him?,"Yes. I spotted him getting his mail. And at first, I was just going to walk on by, but then I thought, No no no. No. Do not be afraid of this man."
536,"So, I walked up behind him and I tapped him on the shoulder. And I said, Hi, remember me? And he furrows his brow, as if he's really trying to figure it out. So I said to him, I said, You little phony. You know exactly who I am.",You said `you little phony`?
537,You said `you little phony`?,"I did. I most certainly did. And he said, he goes, Oh, yeah. You're Jeanettes friend. We did meet once. And I said, Well, how do you go from that to totally ignoring a person when they walk by?"
538,"I did. I most certainly did. And he said, he goes, Oh, yeah. You're Jeanettes friend. We did meet once. And I said, Well, how do you go from that to totally ignoring a person when they walk by?",This is amazing.
539,"And he says, he says, Look, I just didn't want to say hello anymore, All right? And I said, Fine. Fine. I didn't want to say hello anymore either, but just I wanted you to know that I'm aware of it!","You are the Queen of Confrontation. You're my new hero. In fact, you've inspired me. I'm gonna call George about something right now."
540,You mean that?,Absolutely.
541,You don't care?,No.
542,How could you not care?,I don't know. But I don't. I'm actually almost happy to hear it.
543,Am I a bad person? Did I do something terrible?,You're a fine person. You're a humanitarian. She's very sexy.
544,"So I can see her tonight, and you don't care?",See her tonight. See her tomorrow. Go. Knock yourself out. She's too crazy for me.
545,You paid that crook?!,I had to.
546,"He didn't do anything, Jerry. It's a scam! Who told you to do that?",It was embarrassing to me.
547,Why don't you make a point with your own doctor?  What's wrong?,I think I swallowed a fly! I swallowed a fly! What do I do?  What can happen?!

552,Tuesday night? What happened Tuesday night?,I saw your act.
553,My act? Wha-What does that have to do with anything?,"Well, to be honest, it just didn't make it for me. It's just so much fluff."
554,"I can't believe this. So what are you saying? You didn't like my act, so that's it?",I can't be with someone if I don't respect what they do.
555,"Women need to like the job of the guy they're with. If they don't like the job, they don't like the guy. Men know this. Which is why we make up the phony, bogus names for the jobs that we have.

Men on the other hand  if they are physically attracted to a woman  are not that concerned with her job. Are we? Men don't really care. Menll just go, Really? Slaughterhouse? Is that where you work?

567,How come he gets to leave?,"If I wind up sitting next to Uncle Leo, I am leaving. He's always grabbing my arm when he talks to me. I guess it's because so many people have left in the middle of his conversation."
568,"And it's always about Jeffrey, right?",Yeah. He talks about him like he split the atom. The kid works for the Parks Department.

Even in her declining years, whenever she would speak of it, her eyes would light up. It's lustrous coat, it's flowing mane. It was the pride of Krakow."

Now, I am standing outside, and I am freezing, but I cannot leave because I have to tell him what happened to the car. So, finally, he finally comes down with his giant cage filled with doves.

818,"Uh, Carol, can I talk to you for a second? Right now?",Sure.
819,That's what you had to tell me? Your father wears sneakers in the pool?,Don't you find that strange?
820,Don't you find that strange?,Yes.
821,"Well, I painted my apartment again. I've been living in this apartment for years and years, and every time I paint it, it kinda gets me down. I look around, and I think, we'll, it's a little bit smaller now. You know, I realize it's just the thickness of the paint, but I'm aware of it. It just coming in and coming in. Every-time I paint it, it's closer and closer. I don't even know where the wall outlets are anymore. I just look for like a lump with two slots in it. Kinda looks like a pig is trying to push his way through from the other side. That's where I plug in. My idea of the perfect living room would be the bridge on the Starship Enterprise. You know what I mean? Big chair, nice screen, remote control... That's why Star Trek really was the ultimate male fantasy. Just hurtling through space in your living room, watching TV. That's why all the aliens we're always dropping in, because Kirk was the only one that had the big screen. They came over Friday nights, Klingon boxing, gotta be there.",What did you do?
822,What did you do?,Mousse. I moussed up.
823,"You know, I should've done this years ago. I mean, I feel like I've had two lives. My pre-mousse. And now, I begin my post-mousse. Hey, tell me the truth, have you ever seen a better looking guy?","Well, looks are so subjective."
824,"I slid the rent under your door, Harold. Did you get it?","Yeah, yeah... Hey, Jerry, would you like anything from Mrs. Hudwalkers apartment?"
825,"Yeah, yeah... Hey, Jerry, would you like anything from Mrs. Hudwalkers apartment?",You can't give him anything from there!
826,She died? Mrs. Hudwalker died?,Ninety-four years old. I found her yesterday. She didn't have her wig on. It was horrifying.
827,"What's the matter with you? I'm talking! So, Jerry, you know anyone who needs an apartment?",Are you kidding? You know my friend Elaine?
828,Are you kidding? You know my friend Elaine?,"Oh yeah, I like her. She always says hello to me."
829,It's not promised to anybody? 'Cause she'd take it in a second.,"Well, Manny wanted it for his brother, but he got deported."
830,What do you mean deported? It was a misunderstanding with the Department of Immigration.,What's the difference? It's true!
831,What's the difference? It's true!,"So, it's okay? I could just tell her she can have it?"
832,"So, it's okay? I could just tell her she can have it?","Sure, sure. She's getting a bargain, too. It's only four hundred dollars a month."
833,Four hundred dollars? What are you nuts? Someone will pay more.,Okay...
834,"Hey, Harold, what do you think?","Manny, look. Kramer put mousse in his hair."
835,What was that all about?,"Oh, nothing important."
836,What's going on? What is that look?,What look? Nothing.
837,What look? Nothing.,Somethings going on here.
838,Jumping up and down? What are you talking about? Cmon. Cough it up.,"Oh, Elaine. You know the way I am  rarely ever thinking of myself. My only concern is the welfare and happiness of those close to me. Sure, it hurts sometimes to give, and give, and give..."
839,Would you please?,What would you say if I told you that...
840,Told me what?!,...I got you an apartment in this building.
841,You got me an apartment in the building?!,I got you an apartment in the building.
842,Remember Mrs. Hudwalker? The ninety-four-year-old woman who lived above me?,No.
843,She died?!,She died.
844,Four hundred a month? Only four hundred a month?!,Four hundred a month.
845,And I'll be right upstairs?,Right upstairs.
846,Right above you?,Right above me.
847,"The problem with talking is that nobody stops you from saying the wrong thing. I think life would be a lot better if it was like you're always making a movie. You mess up, somebody just walks on the set, and stops the whole shot. You know what I mean? Think of the things you wish you could take back. You're out somewhere with people, Gee, you look pregnant.. are you? Cut, cut, cut, cut, cut, that's not gonna work at all. Walk out the door, and come back in. Let's take this whole scene again. People, think about what you're saying!","Thanks, see you later, Donna."
848,What happened to you?,You can't believe what I just did.
849,What? What did you do?,"I could tell you what I did, but you wouldn't believe it. It's not believable."
850,What did you do?,How could I have done that?
851,How could I have done that?,Done what?
852,Done what?,I told Elaine about an apartment opening up in my building. She's going to move in.
853,Elaines moving into your building?,Yes. Right above me.
854,Right above you?,Yeah.
855,She's right above you?,Right above me.
856,How could you do that?,"'Cause I'm an idiot! You may think you're an idiot, but with all due respect, I'm a much bigger idiot than you are."
857,Did you ever ask an ex-girlfriend to move into your building?,Did you ever go to a singles weekend in the Poconos?
858,Did you ever go to a singles weekend in the Poconos?,"She's right in my building! Right above me! Every time I come in the building, I'm gonna have to sneak around like a cat burglar."
859,"Oh, who's gonna know?",They saw me walk out.
860,My censoring system broke down. You know that little guy in your head who watches everything you say? Makes sure you don't make a mistake? He went for a cup of coffee. And in that second ruined my life.,My censor quit two years ago. He checked into a clinic. Emotionally exhausted.
861,"So, is there any way out of this Elaine thing?",Tough.
862,"Look at that woman feeding her baby greasy, disgusting, coffee shop corned beef hash. Isn't that child abuse?","I'd like to have a kid. Of course, you have to have a date first... Remember my friend, Adam, from Detroit?"
863,"I'd like to have a kid. Of course, you have to have a date first... Remember my friend, Adam, from Detroit?","Yeah, the guy with the flat head."
864,"Oh, man. You know, you're crazy. You're a good looking guy. What do you want to walk around like that for?","No, I'll put half a can of mousse in my head like you."
865,What?,Because somebody offered Manny five thousand dollars for the apartment. I don't want to do it. Manny wants to do it.
866,Why are you telling him it's my fault?,Because it's true! Why shouldn't I tell him?
867,Because it's true! Why shouldn't I tell him?,"Hey, hey. I understand. You're businessmen."
868,What happened to you?,"Religion, my friend, that's what happened to me. Because, I have just been informed that it's going to cost Elaine the sum of five thousand dollars to get the apartment upstairs."
869,Five thousand dollars? She doesn't have five thousand dollars!,Of course she doesn't have five thousand dollars!
870,And how does the baldness fit into that plan?,Elaine?
871,Elaine?,Yeah.
872,Are you kidding? I lie every second of the day. My whole life is a sham!,"'Cause you know, I love Elaine."
873,"But you know... not in the building. Really, I feel terrible about this. My intentions we're good. What can I do? Tell me.","No, I'll be seeing you. `Good morning, good morning.. Have you ever gotten up in the morning and felt it's great to be alive? That every breath is a gift of sweet life from above?"
874,"No, I'll be seeing you. `Good morning, good morning.. Have you ever gotten up in the morning and felt it's great to be alive? That every breath is a gift of sweet life from above?","Oh, and before I forget, I have the checks for the first month, last months security deposit. I have seventy-five dollars left in my account."
875,"Oh, I know. There's a weak shower spray, I know. I've already thought about it, and I'm switching to baths. As Winston Churchill said, Why stand when you can sit? Maybe I'll get some rubber duckies.","Uh, no uh, someone offered Harold and Manny five thousand for the apartment. I'm sure they'd just as soon give it to you, but you'd have to come up with that money."
876,Five thousand dollars? I don't have five thousand dollars.,I know.
877,How am I going to get five thousand dollars?,I have no idea.
878,What?,They want five thousand dollars now.
879,"So, okay uh what's the problem?",I don't have five thousand dollars.
880,"Cmon, you can come up with five thousand dollars. Jerry, you don't have five thousand dollars you can led her? Come on.","Yeah, we'll, I didn't- Is that something you want to borrow?"
881,"Yeah, we'll, I didn't- Is that something you want to borrow?","No, that's too much money to borrow."
882,"Oh, cmon. She'll pay you back. What's five grand between friends?",Of course I'd pay you back..
883,"Yeah, so what's the problem?",Who said there's a problem?
884,Who said there's a problem?,Hey see He said he'd loan you the money.
885,"We'll Jerry, it might take a while for me to pay you back. Maybe a few years. How do you feel about that?",That's okay. He doesn't care.
886,What's to think about?,I don't know... I don't know. Five thousand... let me just take one more look at it.
887,"It was all over! Taken care of. Done! Finished. Five thousand. Where's she gonna get five thousand? She doesn't have five thousand. Clean. Good bye. She's gone. Then you come in, Why don't you loan her five thousand? What do you care? You've got five thousand. Give her five thousand!",You didn't want her in the building?
888,You didn't want her in the building?,"No, I didn't!"
889,"Well, then what did you loan her the five thousand for? Oh, look, maybe she won't take it. I mean, she did say that she was gonna think about it.",People don't turn down money. It's what separates us from the animals.
890,Because I'm a pod?,I'll take it!
891,"Oh, the marathon is great, isn't it?","Oh, yes. Particularly if you're not in it."
892,"What's to see? A woman from Norway, a guy from Kenya, and twenty thousand losers.","...yeah, my wife started getting on me about the lawn today. I'm tellin you, it's one thing after another."
893,Is she here?,"Uh no no, she's working."
894,What does she do?,"She's an... etymologist. You know, bees, flies, gnats. W-What about you?"
895,"She's an... etymologist. You know, bees, flies, gnats. W-What about you?","I work for the Director of Madison Square Garden. It's great! I can get free tickets to any sporting in New York. Anyway, she's a very luck woman. Enjoy the race."
896,Hi how are ya?,"Hey, Jerry just got me a great apartment in his building!"
897,"I'm sorry, I don't see the big deal about being a matador. The bull charges, you move the cape, what's so hard?","So uh, are you really married? Because, I've actually heard of single guys who wear wedding bands to attract women."
898,"So uh, are you really married? Because, I've actually heard of single guys who wear wedding bands to attract women.",You'd have to be a real loser to try something like that.
899,"So you and Roxanne are hitting it off, huh?","Oh, I wouldn't quite say that."
900,"Really? From a distance, you seemed to be coming on to her.",I'm a guy  it always looks like that.
901,"Because, I was thinking... are you at all concerned that living in the same building will, yknow... cramp our styles?",Nah...

905,What are you talking about?,I just found a guy who's willing to pay ten thousand dollars for the apartment.
906,You what?! Get out!  Ten thousand?,Cash.
907,Who would pay that much?,He's in the music business.
908,They rehearse all the time?,All the time. I've been up there six times. They refuse to stop. I can't live like this. I don't know what I'm gonna do. I'm heading for breakdown!  Can't you do something?
909,All the time. I've been up there six times. They refuse to stop. I can't live like this. I don't know what I'm gonna do. I'm heading for breakdown!  Can't you do something?,I'm not going up. It stinks up there.
910,"I don't know. What do you do when a neighbor is making, like, a lot of noise at three oclock in the morning? I mean, can you knock on someones door and tell them to keep it down? You're really altering your whole self-image. I mean, what am I, Fred Mertz now? What's happening to me? Can I do this? Am I a shusher? I used to be a shushee. There's a lot of shushing going on in movie theaters. People are always shushing. Shh... shh... shhh... shhh... Doesn't work, 'cause nobody knows where a shush is coming from. They just hear a shh. Was that a shush? I think somebody just shushed me. Some people you can't shush in a movie theater. There's always that certain group of people, isn't it? They're talking and talking, and everyone around them is shushing them, and shushing them. They won't shush. They're the unshushables.","I have to tell you that I did some very exciting news recently, and I don't know if I should really tell you exactly what it is because it's really not a definite thing yet. Well, I will tell you what I know so far. According to the information that I have in the envelope that I've received, it seems that I may have already won some very valuable prizes. Well, thank you, thank you very much, we'll thank you. That's very nice to hear that. But, in all honesty, I have to say, I didn't even know I was in this thing. But, according to the readout, it looks like I am among the top people that they are considering. You know, that's what annoys me about the sweepstakes companies, they always tease you with that, You may have already won. I'd like once for a sweepstakes company to have some guts, come out with the truth, just tell people the truth one time. Send out envelopes, You have definitely lost! You turn it over, giant printing, Not even close! You open it up, there's this whole letter of explanation, Even we cannot believe how badly you have done in this contest."
911,So how long has it been in the basement?,"Since my grandfather died. I was suppose to send it down to my parents in Florida, but they didn't want it. They told me to get rid of it, but I felt funny and then I sort of forgot about it. And it's been sitting down there for three years until he saw it. All right, so, just take what you want and let's get it out of here."
912,What's in it?,"Grandpa clothes, I can't wear em."
913,You want these? Knee socks. You don't wear knee socks.,"No, go ahead. Look at this place. I can't wait to get it cleaned."
914,How long have you been waiting to squeeze that into a conversation?,Now this I like.
915,What?,"When I was ten years old, my parents had this very same statue on the mantle of our apartment. Exactly. And, one day, I grabbed it, and I was using it as a microphone. I was singing, MacArthur Park, and I got to the part about, I'll never have that recipe again, and it slipped out of my hand and it broke. My parents looked at me like I smashed the ten commandments. To this day, they bring it up. It was the single most damaging experience in my life, aside from seeing my father naked."
916,"What? No dibs! I need this statue. Cmon, give it!","Spread out, spread out you numbskulls. Why don't you just settle it like mature adults?"
917,"Spread out, spread out you numbskulls. Why don't you just settle it like mature adults?",Potato man!
918,"What?! Wait a minute. No, no, no. What are you doing? No, no, oh, oh, okay. He's out. I get it.","No, no, no, no, I'm It. I win."
919,Aren't you gonna take it?,"No, no, no, I don't want to carry it around all night. I'll pick it up later."

925,"So what do you write, childrens books?",That's Ray.
926,"I don't really feel that comfortable with a maid, either, because there's that guilt when you have someone cleaning your house. You know, you're sitting there on your sofa, and they go by with the vacuum, I'm really sorry about this. I don't know why I left that stuff over there. And that's why I could never be a maid, because I'd have an attitude. I'd find them, wherever they are in the house, Oh, I suppose you couldn't do this? No, don't get up, let me clean up your filth. No, you couldn't dust. No, this is too tough, isn't it?","He really did an amazing job. Look! He uncoagulated the top of the dishwashing liquid!  He cleaned out the bottom of the little egg cups! Come here, look at this. He cleaned the little one-inch area between the refrigerator and the counter. How did he get in there?! He must be like Rubber Man!"

928,Why did I think there was a Rubber Man? There's Elastic Man... Plastic Man...,I'm leaving.

949,You wanna go get him?,"Well, then, if he's crazy you should just forget it."
950,Forget it? I already called my parents. I told them to expect the surprise of a lifetime. My mothers making her roasted potatoes!,"George, do you realize that Rava has asked me to edit her book?"

955,That's comforting. Shh. He's coming. Ray?,"Oh, Jerry. I can't believe you asked me about that statue. Do you know how much trouble you could've got me into?"

985,"Are there big coincidences and small coincidences, or just coincidences? We'll?! We'll?!",Will you put that cigarette out?!
986,Will you put that cigarette out?!,Maybe I put it out on your face!  It's just like Ray said. You and Jerry are jealous of our love. You're trying to destroy us.
987,Shouldn't you be out on a ledge somewhere?,"Ma, will you stop?... It's just a statue!... How is it my fault?!... It was stolen. I didn't even touch it this time... Okay, fine... I don't see why this should affect to potatoes!... Okay... Goodbye. She doesn't react to disappointment very we'll. Unlike me."

989,Why don't we just throw a Molotov cocktail through their window?,"There's just no justice. This experience has changed me. It's made me more cynical, more bitter, more jaded."

1001,"People are going to steal from you. You can't stop them. But, everybody has their own little personal security things. Things that they think will foil the crooks, you know? In your own mind, right? You go to the beach, go in the water, put your wallet in the sneaker, who's gonna know? What criminal mind could penetrate this fortress of security? I tied a bow. They can't get through that. I put the wallet down by the toe of the sneaker. They never look there. They check the heel, they move on.","Whenever I see the news and they're hauling in some kind of terrorist, psycho, maniac, mass murderer guy. You notice he's always covering up his face with the newspaper, with the jacket, with the hat. What is he worried about? I mean what is this man's reputation?

It doesn't matter, I gotta keep going.`Women don't do this. See now, women will stop and go, `Well, let me see what the show is before I change the channel.`You see? Men just fly. Because women, you see, women nest and men hunt. That's why we watch TV differently. Before there was flipping around, before there was television, kings and emperors and pharaohs and such had story-tellers that would tell them stories ''cause that was their entertainment. I always wonder, in that era, if they would get, like, thirty story-tellers together so they could still flip around. Just go, `Alright start telling me a story, what's happening? I don't want to hear anymore. Shut up. Go to the next guy. What are you talking about? Is there a girl in that story? ..No? Shut up. Go to the next guy. What do you got?

1280,"Oh, yeah, sure, accident, right. She was aiming right at me like she was putting out a fire! Then, for the rest of the show, I'm sitting there with chocolate all over my shirt. Flies are landing on me. I'm boiling - I'm fantasizing all the things I'm gonna say when I see her.

1395,So what happened with Tatiana?,I shouldn't even tell you this.
1396,"Well, it's this little place with this little bathroom. It's like right there, you know, it's not even down a little hall or off in an alcove. You understand? There's no... buffer zone. So, we start to fool around, and it's the first time, and it's early in the going. And I begin to perceive this impending... intestinal requirement, whose needs are going to surpass by great lengths anything in the sexual realm. So I know I'm gonna have to stop. And as this is happening I'm thinking, even if I can somehow manage to momentarily... extricate myself from the proceedings and relieve this unstoppable force, I know that that bathroom is not gonna provide me with the privacy that I know I'm going to need...",This could only happen to you.
1397,Wow! So...?,"So I'm dressing and she's staring up at me, struggling to compute this unprecedented turn of events. I don't know what to say to reassure this woman, and worst of all, I don't have the time to say it. The only excuse she might possibly have accepted is if I told her I am in reality Batman, and I'm very sorry, I just saw the Bat-Signal. It took me 3 days of phone calls to get her to agree to see me again. Now she's waiting for me to call her, and she's"
1398,Who is that woman?!,"Remember when you first went out to eat with your parents? Remember, it was such a treat to go and they serve you this different food that you never saw before, and they put it in front of you, and it is such a delicious and exciting adventure?

1403,He's always here? What does that mean? What does that mean?,"Oh, Mr. Cohen, very nice man. He live on Park Avenue."
1404,Where am I? Is this a dream? What in God's name is going on here?!,She's not there. She left. She must've waited and left because those people wouldn't get off the phone.
1405,Didja leave a message?,"Yeah, I told her to call me here and to tell anyone who answers the phone to ask for a balding, stocky man with glasses. I better tell him I'm expecting a call."

1412,"Just a movie?! You don't understand. This isn't 'Plans 1 through 8 from Outer Space', this is 'Plan 9', this is the one that worked. The worst movie ever made!","Hey, I got news for you, if we're making this movie, we gotta get a table immediately."
1413,In a Chinese restaurant? Do they take money?,"Do they take money? Everyone takes money. I used to go out with a guy who did it all the time, you just slip him 20 bucks."
1414,"Do they take money? Everyone takes money. I used to go out with a guy who did it all the time, you just slip him 20 bucks.",20 bucks? Isn't that excessive?
1415,20 bucks? Isn't that excessive?,"We'll what do you want to give him, change?"
1416,"We'll what do you want to give him, change?",It's more than the meal!
1417,"I'm counting your shrimps. OK, Who's gonna do it?","Oh no, I can't do it. I-I'm not good at these things, I get flustered. Once I tried to bribe an usher at the roller derby, I almost got arrested."
1418,Me? What about you?,"Oh, I can't do that, it's a guy thing."

1448,Who said you have to like it?,"Everybody likes pesto. You walk into a restaurant, that's all you hear - pesto, pesto, pesto."

At Queens Boulevard, I took the shoulder. At Jewel Avenue, I used the median. I had it. I was there.. and then.. I hit the Van Wyck. They say no one's ever beaten the Van Wyck, but gentlemen, I tell you this - I came as close as anyone ever has. And if it hadn't been for that five-car-pile-up on Rockaway Boulevard, that numbskull would be on a plane for Seattle right now instead of looking for a parking space downstairs."

2724,How much did he save?,"Frankly I am shocked that you would ask such a question  of me, that you would think - the only surprise is how you could even think of that. That's what you we're seeing."
2725,Did you tell her anything?,No.
2726,Do you swear?,I'm not swearing. I don't want to swear.

2730,"Oh, Georgie, you bought this for me? Oh I knew you cared for me.","As you care for me. Which is why it is very important that you never breathe a word of this to anyone about the... you know. What, with Clarence Thomas and everything."
2731,"Okay, okay, can I open it now?",Yes of course go ahead. My guess is you're going to like this very much.
2732,Oh! Is that cashmere?,Of course it's cashemere.
2733,"When I was a little girl in Panama, a rich American came to our town and he was wearing the softest most beautiful sweater. I said to him, `what do you call this most beautiful fabric?`, and he said `they call it cashmere`. I repeated the words `cashmere, cashmere`. I asked if I could have it, and he said `No. Get away from me.`Then he started walk away. But I grabbed onto his leg screaming for him to give me the sweater and he dragged me through the street. And then he kicked at me with the other foot and threw some change at me. Oh, but I didn't want the change Georgie. I wanted the cashmere.","I had a feeling you would like it. No, don't try it on now, try it on later."
2734,What's this?,"I was in the men's room the other day and they had the hand blower, instead of the paper towels, you know this thing. I like the hand blower I have to say. It takes a little bit longer, but I feel when you're in a room with a revolting stench you want to spend as much time as you can."
2735,In the old days how do you think they got the alcohol from town to town?,I don't know.
2736,On the wagon. Don't you think they broke into a couple of those bottles along the way?,You can't drink on a wagon it would be too bumpy.

2738,What the he'll do you know about wagons?,I know enough not to get on them.
2739,I'm going to get right to the point. It has come to my attention that you and the cleaning woman have engaged in sexual intercourse on the desk in your office. Is that correct?,Who said that?
2740,Who said that?,She did.
2741,"Was that wrong? Should I have not done that? I tell you I gotta plead ignorance on this thing because if anyone had said anything to me at all when I first started here that that sort of thing was frouned upon, you know, 'cause I've worked in a lot of offices and I tell you peope do that all the time.",You're fired.

2749,Is that cashmere?,Of course it's cashmere.
2750,What's this?,"But in a way, I think I inadvertantly turned this guy into an alcoholic. I hate being around alcoholics because they're either telling you how much they love you or how much they hate you. And those are the two statements that scare me the most. But I think he's okay now because I have no idea how he feels about me. He's finally off the wagon."
2751,Couldn't he just take the D straight to Coney Island?,"Well, yeah..."
2752,"Ok, what time is your job interview George?",945

2759,How many tickets are you paying today?,"Well, let's see speeding, running a red light, no license, no registration, no plates, no brake lights, no rear view mirror...yeah."
2760,No doors?,"I'm fighting that one. You know, this is gonna cost me over six hundred bucks."
2761,"So, can I convince anybody to come down to Coney Island with me? I got to pick up my car at the pound. George?",I can't believe they actually found your stolen car.

2772,"So, do you work for one of those big broker-houses?",They wish. I hate the big broker-houses. Hate them with a passion. Big broker-houses killed my father.
2773,Really?,"Well, they hurt him bad. Really hurt his feelings. It's a long story. I- I don't like to talk about it, but I swore then that I would never work for big broker-houses. See, all they care about is money. I'm about more than money, I'm about people, always gone my own way and I've never looked back."
2774,What's ironic?,"This, that we've come all this way, we have made all this progress, but you know we've lost the little things, the niceties."

See, they've been sandbagging and looking for a good spot. He's been getting it light 'cause they've been using bug boy and the workout hasn't been published. Now they are ready to run with it.

I tried to scream out but it was too late. It was already on it's way."
3332,But why? Why McDowell?,"Well, maybe because we we're sitting in the right field stands cursing at him in the bullpen all game."

3349,How would we do it?,"We just go up to him, we say, `We're O'Brien.`"
3350,Maybe he knows O'Brien?,"No, he doesn't know O'Brien, if he knew O'Brien he wouldn't have a sign. Let's just do it."
3351,What if we get caught?,What's gonna happen? They can't kill us.

3382,"Right. The other members of our party. Other members of our party? What other members of our party? I didn't even know we we're in a party. Oh, I'm telling you, the jig is up.","It was a bad jig to begin with, we never should have started this jig."
3383,"It was a bad jig, a terrible terrible jig. What are we gonna do now? They're gonna know you're not O'Brien.",There could be more than one O'Brien on a plane who ordered a limo.
3384,I don't want to be Murphy anymore; do I still have to be Murphy?,"Yes, you have to be Murphy."
3385,"Who are you, Mannix?",We're slowing down. Are those the people?
3386,We're slowing down. Are those the people?,"Alright put your hands up over your face, pretend you're sleeping."

3406,That's pretty strange. Did he say anything else?,"Yeah. He said, um, he said it's really important that we call them O'Brien and Murphy."
3407,O'Brien. Why would he want to be called O'Brien?,...and the Jews steal our money through their Zionist occupied government and use the black man to bring drugs into our oppressed white minority communities.
3408,"You're not going to open with that, are you?",What was that you said about the myth of the Holocaust?
3409,What was that you said about the myth of the Holocaust?,I said so many things.
3410,"Something's very strange. George goes to the airport to pick up Jerry. They come back in a limo with four tickets to the basketball game and wanna be called O'Brien and Murphy? O'Brien. O'Brien, why O'Brien?",Elaine?
3411,Elaine?,"Dan! Oh, hi Dan, how are you?"

3428,"Oh no no no, this is no joke. O'Brien's coming in from Chicago, Jerry's in a limo, says he's O'Brien? That's not funny. Oh my god. Yes. Yes!",What is it?
3429,What is it?,"Don't you see? There's always been something very strange about Jerry, always so clean and organized. Do I have to spell it out for you? The limo? The name? The rally at Madison Square Garden? Jerry, O'Brien are the same person. Jerry is the leader of the Aryan Union!"

3434,What?,The CIA! Maybe they placed him in there to infiltrate the organization from within.
3435,What about his comedy act?,"That's the perfect cover! All that time on the road? Look Jerry, he's too normal to be a comedian. These comedians, they're sick, neurotic people."
3436,"That's the perfect cover! All that time on the road? Look Jerry, he's too normal to be a comedian. These comedians, they're sick, neurotic people.",What about George?
3437,What about George?,"What about him, he's part of it. His whole personality is a disguise. No real person can act the way he does. Elaine, I'm telling you they're with the organization. They're all part of it. He's in there with Helms and Hunt and Liddy, that whole crowd. George and Jerry, they probably know who killed Kennedy!"
3438,"Alright, what are we gonna do? I'm not gonna let him hurt you. I'm not gonna.","Kramer, you're hurting me!"

3457,What? What? I can't hear you. Jerry?,"Uh, excuse me, uh, I was uh, driving behind you, uh, a few blocks back, and I, I couldn't help, uh, maybe you didn't realize, uh, I witnessed that, uh, um, you're tire's a little low.

3458,I love when they touch your arm. I can't get enough of that. Why is that?,Let's not even analyze it.
3459,So you didn't turn her in?,I wanted to but I couldn't go through with it.
3460,Gonna see her again?,Friday night.
3461,"Oh, you dig?",Yes! I see enormous potential here.
3462,Why?,Because great couples always have a great story about how they met. That's why I've never been in a long term relationship. I've never had a good meeting story.
3463,"On the other hand, does that mean she should never be allowed to date again? You scratch one car and you're forbidden to have social contact for the rest of your life?!","What am I drinking, milk?"

3475,Did you tell Kramer?,"Ah, nah!"
3476,What? What? What? Tell me.,"Jerry saw this guy crash into a car, and he followed him."
3477,"Good for you! What kind of a sick lowlife would do a thing like that? You know those people, you know they're mentally disturbed.",They should be sent to Australia.
3478,Australia?,"Yeah, yeah, that's where England used to send their convicts."
3479,Yeah?,What happened to you right here?
3480,What happened to you right here?,I don't know!
3481,"Alright, oh Jerry, we're still on for Friday night, right?","Oh Friday, I can't, I'm sorry, I have a date."
3482,You'll pay? I'm there.,Why do you even need anybody?
3483,Why do you even need anybody?,"Because I hate being at a table alone, with a married couple. Talking about their married friends, and their married furniture. They're always trying to make me feel like their life is so much better than mine. You know, I have a very exciting life. It's very exciting."
3484,You went out with a bullfighter?,"Yes, we'll, an ex-bullfighter now."

3489,You know who's a good actor? Anthony Quinn.,"Oh, Anthony Quinn, fine actor. But from what I understand, not a very good driver. Hits everything on the road. But always leaves a note."
3490,Did you ever see Zorba the Greek?,Excellent film. In fact Quinn said he never felt so good as when he left a note after smacking into a car.
3491,You think you're so damn special because you say 'God bless you'?,"No, no, I don't think I'm special. My mother always said I'm not special."
3492,We'll who's side are you taking?!,We'll I'm not taking your side!
3493,I said 'God bless you'. Was that so wrong?,"The question is, did you allow a space for the husband to come in with his 'God bless you'? Because as the husband, he has the right to first refusal."
3494,"The question is, did you allow a space for the husband to come in with his 'God bless you'? Because as the husband, he has the right to first refusal.",It's me.
3495,What if she's having an off night?,Hi!

3520,"Well, who is she?",I've had a crush on this woman for year! I've always been afraid to approach her! She looks like she belongs on one of these Hallmark cards.
3521,"Oh yeah. Too bad. Angela. Lousy thug. I mean what kind of sick person does something like that? That woman belongs in prison! I mean, I actually owe it to society to do something about this! I can't sit by and allow this to go on. It's a moral issue is what it is!",You can't compromise your principles!
3522,How am I going to live with myself?!,Can't live!
3523,Oh my God. I must be crazy. What have I done?,"Oh no, what's wrong?"
3524,"Oh no, what's wrong?",What's wrong? I'll tell you what's wrong. I just committed adultery!

3534,What?!,"No, no George! You don't understand! She didn't tell me she was using me as an excuse! Okay?! But then I realized what was going on, and I said that she left a note. Um, but he didn't really buy that. And then, and then he did mention your name."
3535,"No, no George! You don't understand! She didn't tell me she was using me as an excuse! Okay?! But then I realized what was going on, and I said that she left a note. Um, but he didn't really buy that. And then, and then he did mention your name.",He mentioned my name?! What did he say?!

3610,Why did you even take it? You broke up with her!,I wasn't thinking! I don't know.

3689,George?,"Hey, what are you doing?"
3690,"Hey, what are you doing?",I think I'm parking my car.
3691,"We'll if you didn't think I was parking, why did you put it in head first?","We'll that's the way I park. Anyway, you didn't start backing in until I pulled in."
3692,"Hey, buddy, what can I tell you?",The point is I was here first.

3699,"Me? No no no, you. You're gonna tell him. I'm not gonna tell- Noo.","Oh, come on, you're good at this."
3700,What am I gonna say?,"I don't know, I don't know, you'll think of something."
3701,"Oh god, I need a drink, do you got any Hennigan's here?","Yeah, under the counter. What happened?"
3702,"Yeah, under the counter. What happened?","Oh god. Oh, Jerry it was so terrible what we just went through on the way home. You wouldn't believe it."
3703,"Okay. Now listen. We we're at the toll booth at the Henry Hudson Parkway, okay?! And there we're these, like, this pack of extremely wild teenagers in a convertible behind us, okay?! And for some reason, I don't know, they just started to taunt us! And so then we payed the toll, and then we went through, and then they started to follow us, alright?! So George tries to lose them, and, and, but they we're in this really like a souped up car, you know?! And so he turned off the road really suddenly and the car was on two wheels and I was just screaming! And then, George is such a great driver.",He is?
3704,He is?,"Oh, he is fantastic! And then they fired a gun right up in the air."
3705,A gun?!,"I think it was a gun. And then they followed us all the way into the city, and then they just stopped and they turned around and they went home."
3706,"My god, are you okay?","Yeah, yeah, I'm alright. Oh, by the way, the car hit a pothole and now it's making a clanking noise."
3707,Where's George now?,"Oh, he's out in front of the building. He's arguing with some guy about a parking space."
3708,What are you talking about?,"Look out the window, you'll see."
3709,Are you okay?,"Yeah, I'm fine."
3710,"Crazy kids, huh?",What?
3711,What?,Ow!!  It's my cuticle.

3716,"Hey, will you tell Kramer I'm outside?","What, you know Kramer?!"
3717,"What, you know Kramer?!",Hi.
3718,And you're watching the fight at Jerry's?,Yeah.
3719,You know that guy downstairs?,"Yeah, he's a real phony."
3720,What's going on?!,"Hey, will you come on down? This guy's in my space!"
3721,"Hey, will you come on down? This guy's in my space!",It's my space!
3722,Are you going down?,Yeah.
3723,Is anything wrong?,Why should anything be wrong?
3724,Why should anything be wrong?,Be down in a minute.
3725,Hey Krame! You know this guy?,"Yeah, yeah, I know him."
3726,You're looking tremendous. What are you on some kind of regimen?,"Yeah, twenty-five percent bran flakes. The forty percent was too much so I found a store to mix it up special for me, they take it down another fifteen percent."
3727,"Me? You see what he did here, you see how he tried to sneak into my space?","Hey, just ''cause I went in front first doesn't mean I'm sneaking in."
3728,Did you talk to him?,"Yeah, it's all taken care of."
3729,You told him? What did you tell him?,"I did a number on him, it was a thing of beauty, you really had to have been there to appreciate it."
3730,"I don't believe it, what did you say?",I told him a pack of teenagers in a convertible we're terrorizing us and they followed us into the city.
3731,A pack of teenagers?,"Yeah, by the time I got to the end of the story, he was to relieved that we we're alive he couldn't care less about the car."
3732,"What can I say, you know? It's a gift. I only wish I could teach it but, you know it's inborn.","By the way, thanks a lot for inviting me to the flea market."
3733,What?,"Yeah, Jerry, he told me all about it."
3734,A flea market? You went to a flea market??,"Hey, who's talking to you?"
3735,"Hey, who's talking to you?",We just didn't think of you.
3736,What? Every time I leave my house now I have to call everybody I know and ask them if they want to do what I'm doing?,"Great move, telling him, by the way, real smart move."
3737,"Kramer? I'm so sorry, really.","Yeah, I'm sorry."
3738,"What was wrong with that sorry? It was a good sorry. Jerry, was that a good sorry?",It was a so-so sorry.
3739,And like you're not gonna just back it in if I do that?,We'll somebody better move something soon! I got a truck full of ice cream here!
3740,"You see, they had to move the cars so the truck could get through, right? But these guys don't trust each other so they got these two nonpartisan drivers to move them.","Wild pack of teenagers, huh?"
3741,"Wild pack of teenagers, huh?",Yeah.
3742,"Yeah. I know, I said to myself, 'Why us?' You remember?",Uh huh.
3743,What did you do to my car?!,"I couldn't help it! Elaine moved the mirror, I got discombobulated."
3744,Will you move it up a little bit?,"No no no, that's in the right position."
3745,Do you mind?,Do you?
3746,Do you?,"Hey, somebody better move these cars, you're making a commotion."

4168,"Oh, no reason. You're into karate right?",You want to hit me?
4169,You want to hit me?,What are you doing here?
4170,What are you doing here?,I dreopped a script off.
4171,Why?,Kramer's party.
4172,Kramer's ... having ... a ... party?,"No, no, he's not having a party. He's doing something. I don't know what it is. It's nothing. He's not doing anything."
4173,What was that?,"I can't believe what I just did. I didn't know kramer didn't invite him. I better call Kramer, ..."
4174,"Okay, okay. Look, you do all the talking, okay?",Relax. Who are they?
4175,Relax. Who are they?,"Yeah, they're not better than me."
4176,Who are they?,They're nobody.
4177,What about me?,What about you?
4178,What about you?,Why them? Why not me?
4179,Why them? Why not me?,Why not you?
4180,Why not you?,I'm as good as them.
4181,You really think so?,No.
4182,"What about you, George? Have you written anything we might know?","Well, possibly. I wrote an off-Broadway show, `La Cocina.`..Actually, it was off-off-Broadway. It was a comedy about a Mexican chef."
4183,"Oh, it was very funny. There was one great scene with the chef - what was his name?",Pepe.
4184,"Oh, he actually cooked on the stage?","No, no, he mimed it. That's what was so funny about it."
4185,"So, what have you two come up with?","Well, we've thought about this in a variety of ways. But the basic idea is I will play myself-"
4186,May I?,Go ahead.
4187,Nothing?,Nothing.
4188,What does that mean?,The show is about nothing.
4189,D-A-L-R-I-M-P-E-L?,Not even close.
4190,Is it with a `y`?,No.
4191,What's the premise?,"..Well, as I was saying, I would play myself, and, as a comedian, living in New York, I have a friend, a neighbor, and an ex-girlfriend, which is all true."
4192,You read? You read on the show?,"Well, I don't know about the reading.. We didn't discuss the reading."
4193,"All right, tell me, tell me about the stories. What kind of stories?","Oh, no. No stories."
4194,"No stories? So, what is it?",What'd you do today?
4195,What'd you do today?,I got up and came to work.
4196,How is that a show?,"Well, uh, maybe something happens on the way to work."
4197,"Well, why am I watching it?",Because it's on TV.
4198,"Okay, uh, look, if you want to just keep on doing the same old thing, then maybe this idea is not for you. I, for one, am not going to compromise my artistic integrity. And I'll tell you something else, this is the show and we're not going to change it. Right?",How about this I manage a circus..
4199,"I don't even want to talk about it anymore. What we're you thinking? What was going on in your mind? Artistic integrity? Where, where did you come up with that? You're not artistic and you have no integrity. You know you really need some help. A regular psychiatrist couldn't even help you. You need to go to like Vienna or something. You know what I mean? You need to get involved at the University level. Like where Freud studied and have all those people looking at you and checking up on you. That's the kind of help you need. Not the once a week for eighty bucks. No. You need a team. A team of psychiatrists working round the clock thinking about you, having conferences, observing you, like the way they did with the Elephant Man. That's what I'm talking about because that's the only way you're going to get better.",... I thought the woman was kind of cute.
4200,Hold it. I really want to be clear about this. Are you talking about the woman in the meeting? Is that the woman you're talking about?,"Yeah, I thought I might give her a call. I, I don't meet that many women. I meet like three women a year. I mean, we've been introduced. She knows my name."
4201,"Why? Maybe she liked me. I, I mean she was looking right at me. You know, I think she was impressed. You know, we had good eye contact the whole meeting.","Oh, I forgot to call Kramer."
4202,What is it?,I was just thinking about this patient of mine.
4203,What?,Just wondering if he's taking his medication.
4204,Why would you think I would invite him?,"I just a ssumed, ..."
4205,Assumed? Never assume anything. I don't want that nut in my house. You know he's on medication.,"Hello, oh, hello. You remember, ... Susan, from N B C."
4206,Of course. How are you?,"Fine, it's good to see you."
4207,Tell me what?,"Well, I,"
4208,"Kramer, are you drinking that milk?",Yeah.
4209,What's the expiration date on that?,September third.
4210,The third?,and SUSAN The third?
4211,and SUSAN The third?,"Um, Uh, ugh, ..."
4212,"What, are you crazy? It's a traumatic thing to be thrown up on.","Vommiting is not a deal breaker. If Hitler had vommited on Chamberlin, Chamberlind still would have given him Chekoslovakia."
4213,What happened to you?,Devola came after me.
4214,What? Devola? See I told you this guy is crazy. I can't believe this. What happened?,"Can I have a coffee. ... What, you know I was walking home and I had to pick up my helmet from the shop, you know. I gota new strap. And I had it on you know, and I was checking the strap out to make sure it fit. Then suddenly I feel this kick hit me on the side of the head. It knocks me down, I look up and it's Crazy Joe Devola. And he say's, `That's what I thin k of your party.`"
4215,"Me, why?",He doesn't like you.
4216,What does he want from me? I didn't do anything. See this is all Elaine's fault. She took off to Europe with his psychiatrist. He probably can't get his medication. Now I got some nut after me.,Pass the cream.
4217,Where the he'll did I put this?,What are you looking for?
4218,What are you looking for?,"The remote, the remote, I can't find the remote. Did I lost, I lost it. Did you take it? Did you put it some place?"
4219,"The remote, the remote, I can't find the remote. Did I lost, I lost it. Did you take it? Did you put it some place?","No, no, no."
4220,"All right, what is this?",what is what?
4221,what is what?,"All right, very funny. I get it."
4222,Fix what?,Your pants!
4223,what is this? What have I got one pant leg on for?,Don't you know? Look-look at your face! You only shaved the right side of your face! What is this? A joke?

4236,What about him?,You just said 'Yo-yo Ma'.
4237,What's Yo-yo Ma?,He's a cellist. You should see a doctor today.
4238,"That doesn't really bode we'll for the show, does it?",The show! Forget about the show! We should take the idea to a different network
4239,"Oh, yeah. Right. Like anybody's ever gonna do this! How did you get me to go along with that? A show about nothing!","It was a good idea. Susan liked it. Now, if he hadn't vomitted all over her, we'd be writing it right now."
4240,"What are you doing? What's wrong with you? What're you doing? Give me that phone! Go to your apartment and lie down, I'll make an appointment for a doctor today. Hello? Oh hi! I'm sorry. No, that's my next door neighbor. He's not quite himself. He got kicked in the head. What? Really? You're kidding! Today? Yeah! Sure! We could make it. Two o'clock? Yeah, we would do that. Okay.

4248,Ha ha! How are you?,"Good, good."
4249,How's your mom and dad?,"Good, fine."
4250,What are you getting to be too much of a big shot now to give me a call? I don't hear from you anymore!,"Oh, no. I've been kinda busy. It's all."
4251,You know where I just came from?,"Oh, sure. Danny."
4252,"The funny thing is I can't wear 'em. I get too hot. I sleep in my underwear and a t-shirt. If it gets too hot, I just get the t-shirt off! Anyway, Danny says to me 'You need any pajamas?'","I-I'm sorry Uncle Leo, I really gotta get going."

He was flailing his arms about as he told the story and then he threw himself on the ground and he grabbed me around the legs and then he begged me to let him go.

How do you even start into being a clown, how do you know that you want to be a clown, I guess you get to a point where you're pants look so bad, it's actually easier to become a clown than having the proper alterations done. Because if you think about it, a clown, if there isn't a circus around them, is really just a very annoying person. You're in the back seat of this guys Volkswagen, `What, you're picking somebody else up? Oh man!`","Camera, curtains, lights - This is it, we'll hit the heights - Oh what heights we'll hit - On with the show this is it!"

These opera kids they're going two-fifty, two-eighty, three-twenty-five, they're wearing big white woolly vests, the women have like the breastplates, the bullet hats with the horn coming out.

4929,Fine. Break up with her. But you know what this means?,"No, what?"
4930,"No, what?","The script, the pilot, the TV show. That's all over."
4931,Why? What do you mean?,"Figure it out. She's one of the executives at NBC that's gonna make the decision whether or not they pick up the show. She's one of our biggest fans. You drop her off, you think they're gonna pick us up?"

So I carry around my diaphragm, who doesn't? Yeah, like it's a big, big secret that women carry around their diaphragms. You never know when you're gonna need it, right?  Ahh.",I should be going.
4953,So we'll talk about the hooks then?,Yes.
4954,What? Was it something I said?,"She's a virgin, she just told me."

4968,Where's the food? What happened to Ping?,"Don't worry, he'll be here. Look, we only got about two hours. We just need to come up with one good story so we can get through this meeting. There's your food."
4969,"Hey, what about this? I'm in a car accident. The motorist is uninsured, you with me?",Yeah.
4970,Your butler?,"Right. He cooks my food, he cleans my house, he does all my shopping for me. And there you go, that's your program."

4972,"That's the stupidest idea I ever heard. Sentenced to be a butler. Ping, what happened?",There was a bit of an accident.
4973,What happened?,"Marla and I went out for coffee and afterwards I was crossing the street and he was biking right towards me. So I got out of the way just in time, but then he ran into a parked car. He hit his head and everything went flying."

4979,Yeah. Where's yours?,He dropped it.
4980,"You should slow down, you know that? It's dangerous to go that fast.","No, no. I have green light. You jaywalked."
4981,"Hey, you watchin' Oprah?",I did not jaywalk.
4982,We got work to do. What about the meeting?,"Hey, look. An hour with Patrick Swayze."
4983,"A month and a half we had. We did nothing. I can't believe we put it off until today and then we couldn't do anything because Elaine runs out to apologize to a virgin, crosses against a light, and knocks over a Chinese delivery boy. Now we're gonna make fools of ourselves, we got nothing. You're not even in show business. I gotta reputation. You drag me into the sewer with you. I've been on TV buddy boy. You know how fast word spreads in show business? It's like that  , like that! One bad impression, you're outta the business!","All right, let's postpone it. Let's get out of here."
4984,What do you mean? They know we're here.,"I'll fake an illness. My back! My back! I can't believe, my back."

4989,Where's George?,"Oh, he ran to say something to David Letterman."
4990,David Letterman's on the floor?,"Yeah, he just walked by."
4991,So how are you guys comin' along?,"Good, good, we've got a lot of ideas."
4992,"Have you ever been to a Chinese restaurant and they tell you it'll be, like, five minutes for a table and you wind up waitin' there for, like, thirty minutes? Well, we thought it would be very funny to do an entire show where all you're doin' is waitin' for the table. Because we've all been in that situation. You know, you're waiting... and you're hungry... and you bump into somebody you know... When is Russell coming back?",So that's the idea?
4993,So that's the idea?,"We'll no, that's one. We have many others. We have an idea where, uh, I get into an accident with a guy who has no insurance and the judge sentences him to be my butler. You know he cooks for me, he has to cook for me... He cleans my house, he's doin' my shopping, you know? I'm walkin' around with one of those big neck collars."
4994,"We'll no, that's one. We have many others. We have an idea where, uh, I get into an accident with a guy who has no insurance and the judge sentences him to be my butler. You know he cooks for me, he has to cook for me... He cleans my house, he's doin' my shopping, you know? I'm walkin' around with one of those big neck collars.",Those collars are funny!
4995,"You tellin' 'em about the butler story? Is that beautiful or what? Hey, sorry I'm late. Russell?",I'm Rita Kearson.
4996,"Oh, Rita. Hey, Mr. Shermack, how're you doing, good to see you. Jay, always a pleasure. Sweetie. Yeah, yeah, that butler idea, that's beautiful. Isn't that killer?  I thought I was getting the butler.","Don't worry, uh, we'll find something for you."
4997,"So Letterman didn't spark to your idea, huh?","No, he said there was nothing he could do, and next time I should probably break the Prozacs in half."
4998,"You, you guys wanna hold it down? I'm watchin' Jeopardy.",Would you give him the TV back?
4999,Would you give him the TV back?,"Oh, by the way, George. Susan called for you a minute ago."
5000,I bet they're probably doing summersaults about us over there. You think they get butler stories like that everyday?,Who is Joseph Cotton? Giddee up!
5001,Who is Joseph Cotton? Giddee up!,Hello?
5002,Hello?,"Hi, it's me. It's Georgie Boy. What's going on?"

5086,"Oh. So, did you make it through the night?","Yes, I'm proud to say I did!"
5087,"Woah, woah, woah. What-what did you just say?","I can't take it anymore! She's driving me crazy! I can't sleep, I can't leave the house, and I' here, I'm climbin' the walls. Meanwhile, I'm dating a virgin, I'm in this contest - something's gotta give!"
5088,"Do you hear what you're saying?! Can you hear it?!  This is a beautiful woman walking around naked, and you want to tell her to stop?! That's the dumbest thing I ever heard! I mean, think comprehens- I'm not gonna let you do it.","Well, I'm doin' it, get out of my way."

5095,`Quite a workout`? What did you say?,"I said, `yeah.`"
5096,"So then, listen, listen. So then, I showered and I dressed, and I saw him again, on the way out. So we're walkin' and talkin', and he asked me my name - and I think I said Elaine - but, I mean, who the he'll knows.. And so then, he says to me `Do you wanna split a cab uptown?`And I said, `Sure`- even though I was going downtown. So, we get in the cab, and I mean, I have no idea where I'm goin', right? But this is John F. Kennedy Junior we're talkin' about!  So, then, he says to me, `Where do you live?`And I - and I - and I was close to your block, so I said your building.

5102,"Could you go now, George? I'm very hungry. I'm weak.","Well, wait a little while, Ma. What's the difference?"
5103,"Well, wait a little while, Ma. What's the difference?",I don't understand why you can't do this for me!
5104,Did you get your hair done today?,"No, I just, uh, fixed it.. a little bit."
5105,What? What? Who? Me-me-me? I made an impression? What impression?,Let me just put this back.

5118,What happened?,It was..uh.. John-John.
5119,Why outside here?,"Because he think I live here. Remember when we shared a cab, and he dropped me off out in front? He's picking me up."

5137,"Hey, could you do me a favour? [pause] Could you shut-up?",Hey guess what? This window doesn't work.
5138,Hey guess what? This window doesn't work.,"I hate rental cars. Nothin' ever works the window doesn't work, the radio doesn't work... and it smells like a cheap hooker... [pause] Or is that you?"
5139,"I hate rental cars. Nothin' ever works the window doesn't work, the radio doesn't work... and it smells like a cheap hooker... [pause] Or is that you?",Gimme ten bucks and find out...

5142,You know that awning outside my building?,Yeah...
5143,So what happened?,"He didn't come within two feet of the thing. He's wavin at it... So, I told him if he picks us up at the airport, he wouldn't have to pay me anything."
5144,"Hey, how we doin' on time?","Timed out perfectly. Drop off the car, pick up the rental car shuttle, we walk right on the plane..."
5145,Where you goin'?,"Uh, JFK. [To Elaine] I need some small bills for a tip. You got anything?"
5146,"Uh, JFK. [To Elaine] I need some small bills for a tip. You got anything?","Yeah, you want five?"
5147,"Yeah, you want five?",Gimme ten.
5148,You're giving him *ten* dollars?,"Well, we got three bags."
5149,"People like you? I wouldn't expect much, you don't even look like you know what you're doing...","C'mon, seriously..."
5150,What!?,That's right.
5151,*Five* dollars a bag? I don't think so.,"Look, you asked, I told you."

5163,"Hey, what made you think you could touch that awning?",I confused it with another awning.
5164,So how we doin' on time?,"We're perfect. I timed this out so we would pull up at the terminal *exactly* 17 minutes after their flight is supposed to land. That gives them just enough time to get off the plane, pick up their bags and be walking *out* of the terminal as we roll up. I tell you, it's a thing of beauty. I can not express to you the feeling I get from a perfect airport pickup. What's going on? What are you doing? The Long Island Expressway? What are you getting on the Long Island Expressway for? Do you know what the traffic will be like? This is a suicide mission!"
5165,"We're perfect. I timed this out so we would pull up at the terminal *exactly* 17 minutes after their flight is supposed to land.

I can not express to you the feeling I get from a perfect airport pickup. What's going on? What are you doing? The Long Island Expressway? What are you getting on the Long Island Expressway for? Do you know what the traffic will be like? This is a suicide mission!",Will you relax?!
5166,Will you relax?!,"Oh, I had it perfectly timed out the Grand Central, the Van Wyck! You destroyed my whole timing!"
5167,Do you know what happens if I miss him? I don't get credit for the pickup and I lose my 50 bucks...,"George, there's no traffic at this time. Now, come on, man..."
5168,Really?,"If anything, we'll probably get there early. I'll have a chance to go to the Duty Free shop."
5169,The Duty Free Shop? Duty Free is the biggest sucker deal in retail. Do you know how much duty is?,Duty.
5170,"Yeah, `duty`. Do you know how much duty is?","No, I dunno how much duty is."
5171,Is that the new Esquire? Turn to page 146.,Wow! Coming out of the shower... It's a good thing they gave you that washcloth to cover yourself up... What is this an ad for?
5172,Wow! Coming out of the shower... It's a good thing they gave you that washcloth to cover yourself up... What is this an ad for?,"See those wrinkled jeans slung over the chair? Way in the background, out of focus?"
5173,"See those wrinkled jeans slung over the chair? Way in the background, out of focus?",Uh-huh...
5174,How does it look on your side? [Pause while George just stares at him] We'll get there...,"Oh, look at this... He's sleeping and I have to go to the bathroom. Maybe he'll wake up soon. What if my kidneys burst? Is it worth it not to wake this man up to damage a major organ? I hope this disgusting slob appreciates what I'm doing for him... [To passenger on the other side of her, but still to herself] Yeah, make a little more noise with your gum-- that's helpful."
5175,"Oh, look at this... He's sleeping and I have to go to the bathroom. Maybe he'll wake up soon. What if my kidneys burst? Is it worth it not to wake this man up to damage a major organ? I hope this disgusting slob appreciates what I'm doing for him... [To passenger on the other side of her, but still to herself] Yeah, make a little more noise with your gum-- that's helpful.",They're not here! You cost me fifty bucks!
5176,Canceled? Do I still get credit for the pick up? I was here!,"Ok, c'mon... let's go check over at the ticket counter."
5177,Did you see that guy?,No... What guy?
5178,No... What guy?,That guy.. He was just...
5179,"A *blurb*?!? *You're* a blurb! Check out the cover, idiot!","All right, let's go..."
5180,"Laguardia? All right, let's go. C'mon...",Where do I know that guy from?
5181,Where do I know that guy from?,"[To herself, loudly] Wake up, you human slug! Wake up! *Wake* *up*!! I can't hold it anymore! [To the slug out loud] Excuse me, I've gotta go to the bathroom..."
5182,Would you care for some slippers?,"Sounds lovely! [To Tia, motioning to put them on her] May I?"
5183,"Sounds lovely! [To Tia, motioning to put them on her] May I?",Please!
5184,Who's Grossbard?,"When I lived on Third avenue and 18th street 20 years ago, I had this roommate who was *always* behind in his rent. Then one month, he asks me to loan him his share of the rent-- 240 bucks! He took the cash and >pfffft< disappears. Well, I try to find him, I went to his girlfriend's house, even his family. Uh-uh. I never got the money back! He screwed me! And that's the guy-- John Grossbard!"
5185,"Tia, did you see all the flowers in that bathroom? It's like an English garden in there.","They're gardenias, mostly."
5186,[To anyone who'll listen] What'd he say? What'd he say?,"Well, You're not gonna believe it..."
5187,What?,The plane's been re-routed *back* to Kennedy. We've got 45 minutes.
5188,Hi. Can I get to my seat?,You're just gonna have to wait...
5189,How you gonna catch him? He's probably boarded the plane already.,Gimme your credit card.
5190,My credit card?,"Just gimme the card, don't ask me any questions."
5191,"What, are you, nuts? You're gonna spend more on the ticket than you're gonna get back from Grossbard.","No, I'm not gonna use the ticket! I'm gonna get my money, I'll get off the plane and turn your ticket in for a refund. It's not gonna cost you a dime! Now gimme the card."
5192,This is a *great* idea! Here... use this one. I get frequent flyer miles with every purchase... Wait! Get two tickets. As long as your turning it in for a refund what's the difference? I'll get *double* the bonus miles.,"Excuse me. I'm sorry to make you do this, but I got stuck in the aisle and the flight attendant wouldn't let me get through. There's no way to get around that cart..."
5193,I'll try and remember that. [Pause] Where's my meal?,"He asked me where you we're, and you we're gone so long I thought you, uh, switched seats."
5194,"Excuse me? Excuse me, but I didn't get a meal.",Are you sure?
5195,Are you sure?,"Yes, I'm sure! I would know if a tray of food had been served to me."
5196,"Would you? Well, the only meal left is a kosher meal.",Kosher meal? I don't want a kosher meal. I don't even know what a kosher meal is.
5197,Kosher meal? I don't want a kosher meal. I don't even know what a kosher meal is.,"I think it means when a Rabbi has inspected it, or something."
5198,"Oh, You know what? *I* ordered the kosher meal.",Then why didn't you take it?
5199,Then why didn't you take it?,"I ordered it six weeks ago, I forgot."
5200,"Oh, man. You know what... they got the fudge on the bottom-- y'see? That enables you to control your fudge distribution as you're eatin' your ice cream.",I've never met a man who knew so much about nothing.
5201,More anything?,More everything!
5202,Super Savers? Are they refundable!?,"You bought non-refundable tickets, you idiot!"
5203,Do you know how much this is going to cost me?,"Look, I'll tell you what-- I'll split it with you"
5204,"What? Oh, no... nothing for me thanks.",What is your name?

5405,Who's he?,"Remember that guy who opened the restaurant across the street from the building last year and he wasn't doing so we'll and I told him he should make it into all Pakistani and that drove him right out of business? So, you uh, going with me to the auto show with me Saturday?"
5406,"Remember that guy who opened the restaurant across the street from the building last year and he wasn't doing so we'll and I told him he should make it into all Pakistani and that drove him right out of business? So, you uh, going with me to the auto show with me Saturday?","Yeah, yeah."
5407,Can you bring my mail then?,What mail?
5408,What mail?,I picked up his mail while he was on the road
5409,Why didn't Kramer pick it up?,'Cause he's at that baseball fantasy camp in Florida.
5410,"Oh yeah, right. When's he coming back?","Monday, I think."

5412,"Why? We're all very nice, we're very friendly.",We'll be funny.
5413,Why?,"No, it's too trendy, no Isabella's."
5414,What are you doing here? I thought you said you hated Isabella's?,"No, I talked him into it."
5415,What happened to the auto show?,"Oh, we're still going, we're still going. Elaine, do the spokes model."
5416,Would you like to join us?,"Oh no no no, they don't want to join us."
5417,"Ok, we'll why don't we just put these two tables together?","No, no, you can't do that, they're round, it makes an 'eight' and, yeah, we'll alright."
5418,"Jerry? Jerry, tell them that funny story you we're telling me--",No! No.
5419,"No George, it's so funny. We saw this cab driver's picture, right?","You know we should really order, the service is so slow here, by the time you get anything..."
5420,"Oh, Cheryl, can I ask you a legal question? Um, I'm being sued.",Oh? What happened?
5421,Oh? What happened?,"Well, I ran out to apologize to a virgin and I crossed against the light and I knocked over the delivery boy."

5427,Will you excuse me? I have to make a call.,Tell Ping I said hello.
5428,What?,This is not good. This is not good.
5429,What's the matter?,I just don't think it's such a great idea for you to sit here.
5430,Why not?,"He thinks that if you're too funny, he might not look so funny."
5431,Biff?,What?
5432,What?,You're not worried about that?
5433,You're not worried about that?,"No, of course not."
5434,"I mean, so what if I'm funny? Who cares?","He thinks that if a woman sees a guy put on a better show, she'll walk out on his show, go see the other show."
5435,"Well, should we leave?","Maybe you don't have to be so funny. I mean, would it kill you not to be so funny all the time? That's all I'm asking. This woman thinks I'm very funny. Now you're gonna be funny, so what am I gonna be? I'm gonna be a short bald guy with glasses who suddenly doesn't seem so funny."
5436,"Maybe you don't have to be so funny. I mean, would it kill you not to be so funny all the time? That's all I'm asking. This woman thinks I'm very funny. Now you're gonna be funny, so what am I gonna be? I'm gonna be a short bald guy with glasses who suddenly doesn't seem so funny.",This is so ridiculous. Can we just go over there?
5437,This is so ridiculous. Can we just go over there?,"I don't have to be funny, I don't care."
5438,You don't?,No way! It's completely under my control.
5439,"Of course I can, am I being funny now?",A little.
5440,"Oh, this is funny? I'm being funny?",Yeah.
5441,"George, is this funny?",It's funny!  and it wouldn't kill you to not be so funny either.
5442,What? What did I do?,Hi.
5443,"Well, nobody likes to get old, right?","Well, birthdays are merely symbolic of how another year has gone by and how little we've grown. No matter how desperate we are that someday a better self will emerge, with each flicker of the candles on the cake, we know it's not to be, that for the rest of our sad, wretched pathetic lives, this is who we are to the bitter end. Inevitably, irrevocably; happy birthday? No such thing."

Inevitably, irrevocably; happy birthday? No such thing.","Funny guy, huh?"
5445,"Funny guy, huh?","Here, take it. I was glad to get rid of it."
5446,"Oh listen, guess what? Cheryl convinced Ping to drop the case against me.","Drop the case? Well, congratulations, that'll save you some money."
5447,"Drop the case? Well, congratulations, that'll save you some money.","Yeah, no kidding. That lawyer was gonna charge me a fortune."
5448,Hear that? Guess who's back. Hey!,Hey.
5449,Why?,"Uh, we'll there was an incident."
5450,What happened?,I punched Mickey Mantle in the mouth.
5451,What?,"Yeah, I punched him and they took him to the hospital and then they canceled the rest of the week."
5452,You punched who in the mouth?,Mickey Mantle.
5453,What happened?,"Well, you know, we we're playing a game and, you know, I was pitching, and I was really throwing some smoke. And Joe Pepitone, he was up, and man that guy, you know, he was crowding the plate."
5454,"Oh yeah. Well, he throws down his bat, he comes racing up to the mound. Next thing, both benches are cleared, you know? A brouhaha breaks out between the guys in the camp, you know, and the old Yankee players, and as I'm trying to get Moose Skowron off of one of my teammates, you know, somebody pulls me from behind, you know, and I turned around and I popped him. I looked down, and woah man, it's Mickey. I punched his lights out.","Wow, this is incredible!"
5455,What's going on out there?,"What are you doing? This is not right, people. You're making a very bad mistake, very bad."
5456,"What are you doing? This is not right, people. You're making a very bad mistake, very bad.",Babu?  I'll be right back.
5457,Babu?  I'll be right back.,"Yeah, so?"
5458,"Yeah, so?","Then Hank Bauer, you know, he's screaming, `Mickey! Mickey! What have you done with Mickey? You killed Mickey!`"
5459,"Then Hank Bauer, you know, he's screaming, `Mickey! Mickey! What have you done with Mickey? You killed Mickey!`",So what'd you do?
5460,So what'd you do?,"Well, I got the he'll out of there."
5461,They took Babu away?!,"Yeah, the Immigration guy said his Visa was expired. Poor Babu, everything was going so we'll for him. He had an apartment, he had a job. What a shame."
5462,What?,We'll this is interesting.
5463,What is it?,"It's a letter from the Immigration Bureau, it's Babu's Visa renewal application form. They must have put it in my mailbox by mistake."
5464,"Well, doesn't he need that?","If you had given me my mail last week when I got home, this whole thing never would have happened."
5465,"Yeah, so am I being funny now?","No, actually, you're not being funny now."
5466,What do you need her for? There's a million lawyers.,"Yeah, but you said this is one of the things that her firm does."
5467,"Ah, will you stop it already?","Jerry, please?"
5468,"Jerry, please?",How long is this gonna go on?
5469,How long is this gonna go on?,Till I'm comfortable.
5470,"Well, when is that gonna be?",After consummation.
5471,Consummation? I don't think you have enough material.,I actually have a friend in the Immigration Department who owes me a big favor. You're very lucky.
5472,"You're a very serious person, aren't you?","Well, with so many people in the world deprived and unhappy, it doesn't seem like it would be fair to be cheerful."
5473,Do you ever laugh?,"Not really. Sometimes, when I'm in the tub."
5474,That's so sad. What do you do?,"I'm a comedian. Oh, let me get that. You've been so helpful."
5475,"Hey, we're gonna go see Babu now, right?","Yeah, I'll just pay for this."
5476,Come again?,"You see, I've been home for a week and Elaine didn't give me my mail until yesterday, even though I asked her repeatedly for it."
5477,You had my Visa application?!,We'll not technically.
5478,We'll what about her?,I kill both of you!!
5479,Babu?!,No Babu! No Babu! You bad man! You very bad man! You very lazy bad man!
5480,The wheels are in motion?,"The wheels are in motion, things are happening!"
5481,Jerry?,I'm very attracted to him.
5482,"You think the person you we're talking to is him? That's not even close to him. He's funny, Jerry's funny.",He never said anything funny.
5483,"Dark and disturbed? His whole life revolves around Superman and cereal. I convinced him to act like that so that you would think I was funnier. That's how disturbed I am! If you want disturbed, that's disturbed. You can't find sickness like that anywhere, you think sickness like that grows on trees? Nobody is sicker than me, nobody. He's pretending, I'm the genuine article.",So you're telling me Jerry's whole thing was an act?
5484,So you're telling me Jerry's whole thing was an act?,"Yes! And I put him up to it, because I'm sick! I'm the one that needs help."
5485,"Well, should I call you later?",Please don't.
5486,"So, what's up with Babu? How come he's not back?","I don't know, I don't understand it. Cheryl was supposed to take care"
5487,"'S BROTHER,Babu, my goodness, what has happened to you?",Where's Babu?
5488,Where's Babu?,"'S BROTHER,He is in Pakistan!"
5489,Who are you?,"'S BROTHER,I am his brother. He knew a lawyer, it was all going to be fixed."
5490,"'S BROTHER,Then where is Babu? What happened to Babu? Show me Babu!",Snapple?
5491,Snapple?,"'S BROTHER,No, too fruity."
5492,"Hey, what happened? I thought Cheryl was gonna help Babu get his Visa.",She didn't help him?
5493,She didn't help him?,No.
5494,Where is he?,He's in Pakistan.
5495,"What do you mean, oh boy?","Well, last night she told me that she liked you. Not you, the disturbed you, so I had to tell her the truth."
5496,"Told her the truth? Well, you got Babu deported.","What do you mean, I got? You didn't give him his Visa application."
5497,"What do you mean, I got? You didn't give him his Visa application.",That's because she had my mail.
5498,How could you go in there?,"Well, I had to. I had to apologize. I mean, I punched Mickey Mantle, my idol. It was eating me up inside!"
5499,"Well, what happened?","I got down in my knees and went, `Go ahead, Mickey. Hit me. I'm begging you, Mickey, please hit me. C'mon, hit me. I love you, Mickey, I love you!`"
5500,"So, what did he do?","Well, the four of them, they picked me up by my pants and they threw me outside, right into a horse."
5501,Kramer?,Yeah? It's my Chinese food.
5502,Yeah? It's my Chinese food.,"Oh! Ping! Hi! Listen, thank you so much for dropping that lawsuit against me."
5503,What?,"Cheryl call me last night, lawsuit back on."
5504,Why?,"She call you and your friends big liars. You think she nice girl? Wait till you see her in court. She's a shark! They call her the Terminator. She never lose a case. Now you make her mad. She double the damages. Hasta la vista, baby."
5505,"She call you and your friends big liars. You think she nice girl? Wait till you see her in court. She's a shark! They call her the Terminator. She never lose a case. Now you make her mad. She double the damages. Hasta la vista, baby.","So his friend got the mail but she did not give it to him. And then he came to visit me. Said the lawyer was called to help, he said the wheels we're in motion, but there was no motion. There was nothing. And so they sent me back here."
5506,"'S FRIEND,This is a terrible story, Babu. What are you going to do?","I'm going to save up every rupee. Someday, I will get back to America, and when I do I will exact vengeance on this man. I cannot forget him. He haunts me. He is a very bad man. He is a very very bad man."
5507,"I mean, how funny is this?",It's funny.
5508,"I mean, we're not stupid, right? We know when something's funny!","It cannot not be funny! Now come on, let's stay with it, we gotta finish this today."
5509,What does she say...?,"I don't know, what do women say?"
5510,"I don't know, what do women say?",I don't know.
5511,Who?,Your old flame. Gail Cunningham.
5512,Did you talk to her?,"Well, I was on my way to the Y, and I saw her coming towards me? I didn't know what to do! Because I remembered you had three dates with her and she wouldn't kiss you goodnight. So now I'm thinking you know, what is my duty to my friend? Do I acknowledge her? Do I you know ignore her? I mean, what is my responsibility here?"
5513,"Well, I was on my way to the Y, and I saw her coming towards me? I didn't know what to do! Because I remembered you had three dates with her and she wouldn't kiss you goodnight. So now I'm thinking you know, what is my duty to my friend? Do I acknowledge her? Do I you know ignore her? I mean, what is my responsibility here?",So what happened?
5514,So what happened?,"Yeah, yeah, so she sees me and she goes,  `Oh, hi! Kramer!`You know? Like nothing happened! Like she never you know went three dates with you and refused to kiss you goodnight."
5515,"Yeah, yeah, so she sees me and she goes,  `Oh, hi! Kramer!`You know? Like nothing happened! Like she never you know went three dates with you and refused to kiss you goodnight.","Yeah, I know about the three dates."
5516,You know what I did? I snubbed her.,"What do you mean, you snubbed her?"
5517,"What do you mean, you snubbed her?",I walked right by her - bffffft - never said a word.
5518,Right by her?,Right by her!
5519,You couldn't `keep track`of everybody?,"Well, we tried. We couldn't. We didn't know how to, uh... ...we couldn't write for a woman. We didn't know what you would say. Even right now, I'm sitting here, I know you're going to say something, I have no idea what it is."
5520,You have no idea?,Something derogatory?
5521,Something derogatory?,I thought I'd find you here.
5522,"Hi, Elaine. Hey, what is with your friend Kramer?",Why?
5523,Why?,He snubbed me.
5524,Are you sure?,"Yeah, I'm sure. What did you tell him?"
5525,"Yeah, I'm sure. What did you tell him?","Nothing. Hey, where you goin' with that? Gimme that."
5526,"Nothing. Hey, where you goin' with that? Gimme that.",I thought you we're finished.
5527,"I took two bites, how am I finished?  Plus you're coming down with something? You want me to get sick?  Bite?","So, how come? Why did Kramer do that?"
5528,"So, how come? Why did Kramer do that?","I don't know. Once he leaves the building, he's out of my jurisdiction."
5529,"Alright. So, where ya cookin' now?",Pfeiffer's.
5530,Where'd you get 'em?,"They're um, Botticelli's."
5531,Would you care to join us?,"No, no, I gotta get to the restaurant. Oh! See ya."
5532,That bothered you?,"Yes, it bothered me. So I bought a pair of shoes at Botticelli's, I'm not allowed to shop there? That really embarrassed me."
5533,"Yes, it bothered me. So I bought a pair of shoes at Botticelli's, I'm not allowed to shop there? That really embarrassed me.",It did?
5534,It did?,Yes! Couldn't you see that?
5535,Yes! Couldn't you see that?,No. This is why you're not in the pilot.
5536,"Great. Oh, by the way, did you get a chance to read the script?","Yes, yes I did."
5537,"Well, what'd you think?",Uh...it was...good.
5538,You didn't like it?,"Well, no, I -"
5539,I can't believe this! What was wrong with it? What didn't you like about it?,It wasn't funny.
5540,"It wasn't funny? What, are you kidding?","No, I didn't find it funny."
5541,You didn't find it funny?! This is what I'm paying for?,"Well, that whole storyline about a guy who gets into a car accident, doesn't have any insurance, so the judge sentences him to be a butler? I didn't really buy that."
5542,"Well, that whole storyline about a guy who gets into a car accident, doesn't have any insurance, so the judge sentences him to be a butler? I didn't really buy that.","Let me tell you who did, uh, buy it...um we pitched this story to Russell Dalrymple, the president of NBC, and he ate it up with a spoon."
5543,"How's this for criticism? Um...you stink. How do like that criticism? You know what's funny to me? That diploma up on the wall. That is my idea of `com-med-dee`! You sitting here, telling people what to do.",I think you'd better go.
5544,"So, you send me to this therapist to help me with my emotional disorders, and she criticizes our script. What kind of a therapist is that?",I guess she didn't think it was funny.
5545,"Oh, she didn't think it was funny. What is she, Rowan & Martin? We're supposed to meet with NBC tomorrow! She completely shattered my confidence. And I'm paying for this, she's my employee!",I thought your mother's paying for it.
5546,"You know, he's right. It's not her place to criticize the script, which reminds me - what did you think of it? You never told me.",What did I think of it?
5547,What did I think of it?,"Hey, buddy, I got something to tell ya."
5548,You what?,"Yeah, I kissed her."
5549,You kissed her?,Right on the mouth.
5550,What kinda great friend are you? How do you go from snubbing to kissing?,"Well, I saw her outside the Y, you know, she came up to me, she started yelling because I snubbed her, and then we started talking a little bit, and I walked her to her building. And just before I left, I put my arm around her waist, I pulled her to me, and I - mmm - I planted one!"
5551,And what did she do?,She kissed me back.
5552,"I don't get this. I go out with this girl three times, she doesn't want to shake my hand - why's she kissing you?","Because I snubbed her. You see? Women, they like that! Yes! I understand women. The snub is good, they love the snub!"
5553,"Because I snubbed her. You see? Women, they like that! Yes! I understand women. The snub is good, they love the snub!","No they don't. I tried that once. I snubbed for a year. Nothing. Every woman I saw, I snubbed. You never saw people so pleased."
5554,What? Who told you that?,Gail Cunningham.
5555,"I don't understand, why is this woman talking about my shoes? Why are my shoes a topic of conversation?","Well, you know, we we're just talking, and uh she mentioned how you're buying your shoes now at Botticelli's."
5556,`How I'm buying my shoes now at Botticelli's!`Did you hear this?,So what?
5557,So what?,So what?! She is talking about my shoes! She is discussing my shoes! It is nobody's business where I buy my shoes!
5558,So what?! She is talking about my shoes! She is discussing my shoes! It is nobody's business where I buy my shoes!,Hey! Gail!
5559,Why are you talking about my shoes?,What?
5560,What?,My Botticelli shoes. You've been talking about my Botticelli shoes.
5561,What are you talking about?,Did you or did you not tell Kramer that I got my shoes at Botticelli's?
5562,Did you or did you not tell Kramer that I got my shoes at Botticelli's?,Too spicy. He wants another one. You got that pasta primavera?
5563,Too spicy. He wants another one. You got that pasta primavera?,"Look Elaine, I am very busy here."
5564,"Who else have you mentioned my shoes to, huh? I wanna know why my footwear is your conversation!",I am not discussing this. This is insane.
5565,You got that pasta primavera? Let's go!,"Ya ya ya, here."
5566,Are you alright?,"Well, it's my stomach. I think there must have been something in the pasta primavera I had for lunch."
5567,"Oh, Where did you eat?",Pfeiffer's.
5568,What are you saying?,"Well, you didn't hear it from me, but needless to say, if you go in there - stick with the consumee."
5569,"Oh, you have a daughter?","Yeah, she just turned fifteen last week."
5570,What?,Excuse me for a second.
5571,What?,Would you like a Pepto-Bismol? I keep them in my wallet...!   Do you think he liked it?
5572,Would you like a Pepto-Bismol? I keep them in my wallet...!   Do you think he liked it?,I'm not sure. What was that dish he said he had...?
5573,I'm not sure. What was that dish he said he had...?,Pasta primavera.
5574,More jokes?,Another ending?
5575,Another ending?,A different name for the butler?
5576,A different name for the butler?,Maybe we should go.
5577,Daddy? Are you okay?,"Yeah, yeah sweetie. I'm fine."
5578,"So, you live with your mother, huh?","Uh, yeah."
5579,"Daddy, are you alright? What's the matter?",It's just a stomach thing.
5580,"Get a good look, Costanza?",What we're you doing?
5581,What we're you doing?,"Well, it's not my fault. You poked me!"
5582,"It's cleavage. I couldn't look away. What am I, waiting to win an Oscar here? This is all I have in my life.","Looking at cleavage is like looking at the sun, you don't stare at it. It's too risky. You get a sense of it and then you look away."
5583,"All right. So, he caught me in a cleavage peek, so big deal. Who wouldn't look at his daughter's cleavage? She's got nice cleavage.",That's why I poked.
5584,Hey! What is with your friend Elaine?,What?
5585,What?,"She comes to my restaurant, comes right in my kitchen, and starts complaining that I'm talking about her shoes."
5586,She did?,Right in the kitchen. Disgraceful.
5587,Pasta primavera?,Is that what she said?
5588,Is that what she said?,"She's somethin', huh? She's a wild one. She's wearin' me out."
5589,"She's somethin', huh? She's a wild one. She's wearin' me out.",She is?
5590,She is?,"She's sensual. You know, with the...cooking and all."
5591,"Hello? Oh, hi Stu.",From NBC?
5592,From NBC?,Yeah. What's goin' on? What? Really? Oh my god....did he give you a reason?...Oh boy. Okay. Alright. Thanks. Dalrymple just cancelled the pilot.
5593,Yeah. What's goin' on? What? Really? Oh my god....did he give you a reason?...Oh boy. Okay. Alright. Thanks. Dalrymple just cancelled the pilot.,"If you hadn't gone into her restaurant, this never would have happened."
5594,"Look, I don't like people talking about my shoes behind my back, okay? My shoes are my business. The two of you shouldn't have been looking at some fifteen year-old's cleavage anyway!",He poked me!
5595,"Alright, what's the difference. What are we gonna do now? He won't take our calls, we can't get into his office...","You know what we could do? He eats at that restaurant, Pfeiffer's? We could have Gail call us, tell us the next time he's there, go there and talk to him."
5596,"You know what we could do? He eats at that restaurant, Pfeiffer's? We could have Gail call us, tell us the next time he's there, go there and talk to him.","Hey, now you're onto something."
5597,"What? What do you mean, Gail?",Yah-hey.
5598,"What do you mean, Gail? You don't think I can attract attention? You don't think I can put asses in the seats?","Look, sweetheart, you know you've got it all. But let's face it..."
5599,What?,She says she wants those shoes.
5600,She wants my shoes? What kind of person is this? Alright! She is not getting 'em!,"No, come on! I'll buy you another pair!"
5601,"No, but these we're the only really cool ones like this! Don't you see how everybody likes 'em and how everybody talks about 'em?","Elaine, this pilot...it doesn't matter to me, it's not me I'm concerned about...it's my mother. I've been over to the hospital to see her..."
5602,"Oh, come on, wait a second, this whole thing is ridiculous. How do I even know she wears the same size?","Alright, what size are you?"
5603,"Alright, what size are you?",Seven-and-a-half.
5604,"Well, it just didn't seem to be the right project for us right now. So, what we're you saying?","Oh...uh, because if it had anything at all to do with what you perceived as me leering at your daughter, I really have to take issue with that. I did not leer. Did I leer?"
5605,"Oh...uh, because if it had anything at all to do with what you perceived as me leering at your daughter, I really have to take issue with that. I did not leer. Did I leer?",No leer.
5606,"Uh, excuse me, are you using that ketchup?","Uh, no."
5607,"Here's your ketchup back. You know, I had the hardest time trying to get some out. I mean, I just kept pounding and pounding on the bottom of it. Do you have any trouble?",No.
5608,Do you have a...ketchup secret?,"No, I... ...don't have a ketchup secret."
5609,"Field of vision, huh?",How's everything?
5610,How's everything?,Mmmm.
5611,How'd everything go with that NBC guy?,Great.
5612,"The pilot's back on. In fact, Elaine's going out with him tomorrow night.

6287,Who's Russ Meyer?,"Oh, he's this guy who made these terrible movies in the 70's with these kinds of women. He's obsessed. He's obsessed with breasts. That's hard to say."
6288,Really?,What do you mean made up?

6582,"You mean, uh..?",Yes. he was not.. master of his domain.
6583,But how.. uh..?,"The muscles.. became so strained with.. overuse, that eventually the hand locked into a deformed position, and he was left with nothing but a claw. He traveled the world seeking a cure.. acupuncturists.. herbalists.. swamis.. nothing helped. Towards the end, his hands became so frozen the was unable to manipulate utensils,  and was dependent on Cub Scouts to feed him. I hadn't seen another pair of hands like Ray McKigney's until today. You are his successor. I uh only hope you have a little more self-control."
6584,Are you going to be wearing the shirt at the concert?,"Look, it's not my shirt."
6585,Whose shirt is it?,"What's the difference? I agreed to wear it. It's - it's a puffy shirt. I feel ridiculous in it, and I think it's the stupidest shirt I've ever seen, to be perfectly honest with you."

6595,This McKigney guy had a few good years.. How could you forget to turn off an iron?,"Well, I was excited because Jerry was putting on the puffy shirt."

I say cut back on the chair, update the magazines. Why do barbers always display that license? There's no laws in hair cutting, except show every person the back of their head that's the one law. I don't want to see the back of my head. Why do I want to see something that I'm never going to see at any other time?

8116,Signal? What signal?,"Lookit. He knew I was gonna use the machine next, he didn't wipe his sweat off. That's a gesture of intimacy."
8117,"A guy leaves a puddle of sweat, that's a signal?",Yeah! It's a social thing.
8118,"What if he left you a used Kleenex, what's that, a valentine? Now you go up to him and you tell him that if he's thinking of turning me in, that I got the goods on him!",No! I won't be a party to this.

8149,Who?,"Ah, I think he's probably better off."
8150,Why are you doing this?,He wants this guy to think he's in Paris.

8164,"We'll they're so loud, they're always fighting it's uncomfortable, you never notice?",No I notice but they're from your age group I didn't know you could detect abnormal behavior among your own kind.

8180,Why would he ask your parents to go to a museum?,I don't know.
8181,What is that?,Maybe he was just trying to be nice.
8182,Have you ever heard of anyone doing anything like this?,"Wait a second, he just did me a big favor."

8184,What?,Call Rachel.

8188,"We'll what difference does it make? They wouldn't lie to us, they're are dear friends.",What am I supposed to do with all this Paella?
8189,What am I supposed to do with all this Paella?,"They said tomorrow, maybe."

8191,Why wouldn't they like us?  Again with the pepper? What do you gotta use all the pepper for?,Ah keep quiet.
8192,What are you trying to set my mouth on fire?,I don't know what the reason could be.
8193,Jerry have you ever seen any of those impressionist paintings?,Oh sure like Monet.
8194,Don't you think he had to be uh near sighted? I mean know body would paint like that if they could see. It's all out of focus.,"We'll he's from the impressionist school, you know like Monet, Manet, Tippi Tippi Dayday."
8195,"Hello? Rachel, ya uh no they're back.",Jerry if you have something to do we could just sit right here and read.
8196,So uh what are you guys doing for dinner?,We have no plans.
8197,"Look at that, Helen do you see what he's wearing? That's the Executive.",Now what is Executive?
8198,Now what is Executive?,The belt-less trench coat. My father invented it.
8199,Why would they? Know body bought them then.,He's wearing one.
8200,You don't say? You know I have boxes of those sitting in my garage in Florida?,Get 'em up here. You give me twenty-five percent I-I'll take care of everything.
8201,You're gonna first start shipping boxes? We're leaving for Paris in three days.,He'll send them express.
8202,Paris huh?,"Yea, ya..ya know I feel terrible about Joey but it's jus..it's a great business opportunity. I-I don't even know how long I'm gonna be away for."
8203,Where will you stay?,"An apartment complex, the uh the Eiffel Towers. uumm Like I said uh you'll be getting a postcard uh in a few days and again I'm sorry."
8204,Fantastic?,"Ya, we've been trying to reunite Joey with his father who lives in Paris. But he's afraid to fly alone, you know he's kinda withdrawn, but he seems to take to you. So it's a perfect solution."
8205,Yes?,"Uh, let me ask you a question. How come you asked Mr. and Mrs. Seinfeld to go to the museum with you?"
8206,"Uh, let me ask you a question. How come you asked Mr. and Mrs. Seinfeld to go to the museum with you?","Well, they we're in from out of town, I thought they would enjoy it."
8207,"Uhuh, um you didn't feel uncomfortable spending the whole day at the museum with two complete strangers who we're more than twice your age?","No, it was fun."
8208,So how'd you come up with the idea for the belt-less trench coat?,"I came home one night, and I tripped over one of Jerry's toys. So I took out my belt just to threaten him, and I got a glimpse of myself in the mirror."
8209,Did you call Jack Klompus yet?,I haven't been able to reach him. Hey I'll call him right now.
8210,Jerry have you seen Schindler's List?,No I haven't seen it yet.

8213,Alright how the he'll do I know?,"Anyway there are these three big boxes, you can't miss them. I want you to ship them here to New York for me."
8214,What's in the boxes?,Raincoats.
8215,Raincoats?  You think you're gonna sell those old crappy raincoats? That's garbage.,I guarantee you Doris is not letting him mail those boxes.
8216,When do you want these?,Send them tomorrow.
8217,You think they're coming tonight?,I dunno they said maybe.
8218,Georgie what we're you doing poking around the attic last night?,I-I wasn't in the attic.
8219,What?,I will not tolerate infestation.
8220,They will get a good home won't they?,Look I gotta be honest with you there's nothing here too spectacular.
8221,"Hey, George what are you doing here?","Uh, I'm just selling some of Dad's things,  that's what he would have wanted."
8222,Dinner?,Ya.
8223,You had dinner with the Seinfelds'?,"Yea, last night."

8225,"Hey, remember this raincoat that you sold me?",Sure that's the Executive.

8236,Hey could you do one other thing for me?,Name it.
8237,You think your parents would have any objections to taking a little kid to Paris with them?  It turns out that the kid's father lives in Paris. Is that a coincidence?  Eh you know Alec wants me to take him over there so I figure as long as they're going,"So you thought as long as they're mailing postcards, it wouldn't be too much to ask my parents to drag a child who they've never seen, through the streets of Paris?"
8238,"So you thought as long as they're mailing postcards, it wouldn't be too much to ask my parents to drag a child who they've never seen, through the streets of Paris?",Alright if you think it's too much they don't have to mail the postcards.
8239,So where's he taking you?,"We'll first we're going to a matine, I'm taking the afternoon off, we're gonna go see `My Fair Lady`and they we are gonna go to dinner. He knows all these fantastic places."

8251,Oh  Elaine really? We'll that sounds interesting.,We saw Regis Philbin get out of a limousine.

8253,So when are you coming down to Florida again?,As soon as is humanly possible.
8254,So uh where's your father?,Ya he's right here.

8266,"How can I go on a cruise with out my cabana wear? I love those, those clothes. AH!  A mouse! I saw a mouse!",It's the remote.
8267,Where the he'll are my clothes? I love those clothes.,Lousy moth ridden crap.
8268,So how was the movie?,"Oh, really good, really good."
8269,"What about the end, with the list?",Ya that was some list.
8270,What did you think about the black and white?,The black and white.
8271,Hey what again?,I'm trying to buy some of the clothes back. Hey you wanna come over for dinner tonight? My mother made all this extra Paella.
8272,I'm trying to buy some of the clothes back. Hey you wanna come over for dinner tonight? My mother made all this extra Paella.,"Paella, ya I'll be there."
8273,Twenty-five percent? It was your idea.,Yap I know.
8274,Oh it's you? You're the one who sold me the moth ridden cabana crap.,"You know I've been thinking, why is Kramer getting twenty-five percent?"
8275,"You know I've been thinking, why is Kramer getting twenty-five percent?",We'll he told you about the place.
8276,"So what, why is that worth twenty-five percent? It's a finders fee. You know what a finders fee is?",You find something you get a fee.
8277,What leg work?,"Oh, there's leg work."
8278,Too much?!,"That's right, they're my coats."
8279,"Moths are a discourage to my business, all it takes is one moth to lay eggs. You know what happens to the larvae? They hatch and they're everywhere.","I'm sorry, umm he-here's your money back  I-I-I'll have the clothes."
8280,So uh where are the clothes?,I burned 'em.
8281,"N-I know they're your parents Jerry an' they're very nice people. But don't you think it's odd, that a thirty-five year old man is going to these lengths to see that someone else's parents are enjoying themselves? I mean don't you find that abnormal?",It is a tad askew.
8282,I mean they're your parents and you don't do anything. So why is this stranger doing it?,I've hardly been out to dinner with them.
8283,So what are you going to do?,"I don't know, I don't know what to do. Oh god.... so how was the movie?"
8284,"I don't know, I don't know what to do. Oh god.... so how was the movie?",Uh from what I saw it was pretty good.

8287,"You we're making, out during Schindler's List?","I couldn't help it. We hadn't been alone in a long time, it just got the better of me."
8288,During Schindler's List?,We're both living with our parents.
8289,Did anybody see you? Did anyone say anything?,No I don't think so. I saw Newman as I was leaving but see me.
8290,Uh ah  Having a nice trip?,"Wonderful, we went to the theater last night."
8291,Wondering what?,Why I didn't see you at Schindler's List with Jerry.
8292,Why is that?,We'll he really seemed to have his hands full if you know what I mean.
8293,What?,"What, do I have to spell it out for ya? He was moving on her like the storm-troopers into Poland."
8294,"What, do I have to spell it out for ya? He was moving on her like the storm-troopers into Poland.",Jerry was necking during Schindler's List?
8295,Jerry was necking during Schindler's List?,Yes! A more offensive spectacle I cannot recall. Anyway I just really came up to get some detergent.

8299,You we're making out during Schindler's List?,What? No.
8300,What? No.,Don't lie Jerry.
8301,How could you do such a thing?,"I couldn't help it. We hadn't been alone together in a long time and we just kinda started up a little during the coming attractions and the next thing we knew, the war was over."
8302,You didn't get in?,"Oh I got in, I had to break the window with a rock and then I got my hand all cut up reaching in."
8303,You broke the window?,He broke the window?
8304,He broke the window?,You wanted those damn boxes didn't you?
8305,You wanted those damn boxes didn't you?,He should be on his hands and knees thanking you.

8312,W-what do you mean you're not making the flight?,"We have to make the flight, we're with a charter group. If we don't the trip is off."
8313,Some place else? What about Paris?,"You don't understand, I've come this far, I can't stop now."
8314,Moths?,"Moths, ate three boxes?"
8315,"Moths, ate three boxes?","We'll you know what happens with larvae hatch, they-they're everywhere."

8327,What happens to charter tickets when you don't use em?,We'll I suppose they are wasted.
8328,You want the tickets?,Yes.
8329,You're gonna take this kid to Paris?,"Hey I get a free trip to Paris, I go in the Big Brother's Hall-of-Fame, I mail my own postcards."
8330,"Oh, you should have gone to the Costanzas' for dinner. Mmm the Paella was magnificent. Have you ever had really good Paella?",Not really.
8331,Hey Dad are you sure we are at the right carousel?,This is it.
8332,So how much are we gonna make?,"Take it easy, I've been through a million of these negotiations."

8334,More? More than three thousand?,Just watch me do my thing.
8335,"Say Dad,  isn't that one of yours?","Look at this. Look at how this idiot packed it. He didn't tape it, he just flipped the flaps. Kramer you missed a couple."
8336,Dad isn't that your charter group?,"Honesty, hard-work, these are the values that I was raised on. The most important thing Joey, is to be able to look yourself in the mirror before you go to sleep at night."
8337,You burned them? Those clothes are not yours to burn.,Who are you anyways?
8338,Who are you anyways?,I'm the father.
8339,He said I was dead?,That's right. Squeezed an extra twenty-five dollars out of me.

8349,Hi Mr. Goldstein is Rachel home?,"I'm afraid Rachel's not going to be able to see you tonight, or any other night for that matter."
8350,Why what did I do?,"You know very we'll. I heard about your behavior at the movies the other night it was disgraceful. You should be ashamed of yourself, I for one will not allow my daughter to be involved with someone of such weak moral fiber. Fortunately my postman happened to have witnessed the entire incident. A heavy set fellow, I believe he lives in your building. Now if you don't mind."
8351,"Aahh,  Get Out! How did it happen?","The broken window, Klompus never fixed it. They just walked right in."

8436,Wha.. you ran?,"No, I jumped on the bus. I told the driver, `I got a toe here, buddy - step on it.`"
8437,"Yeah, yeah, then all of a sudden, this guy pulls out a gun. Well, I knew any delay is gonna cost her her pinky toe, so I got out of the seat and I started walking towards him.

8445,She got the promotion?,Yep.
8446,Why?,"I'll tell ya why. Because of her pinky toe, that's why. Because Lippman felt so sorry for her, he didn't want to hurt her feelings."
8447,"Sure, the pinky toe is cute! But, I mean, what is it? It's useless! It does nothing. It's got that little nail that is just impossible to cut. What do we need it for?","Because Elaine, that's the one that goes 'wee-wee-wee all the home.'"
8448,"Hey Elaine, did you hear the good news? Toby got promoted!","Yes, I heard, Kramer - I work there, remember??"

8622,Yes?,I've been doing a lot of thinking.
8623,Uh huh?,"Well, I don't think we should see each other any more."

8639,"I can't believe you're moving out. Kramer, is this true? Is it really happening? It's ... it's like a dream.","Oh, it's true."
8640,"Jerry, did you hear this?",He knows what he's doing.
8641,Why'd you have to eat so many?,Because they're Jujyfruit. I like them. I didn't know it would start a chain reaction that would lead to the end of Pendant Publishing.
8642,"Yeah, you knew he had a cold. How'd you expect him to blow his nose? YEA!",Do you know what's going on here? Can't you see what's happened? I've become George.

8662,Can she talk?,I'm not sure if she's allowed to talk.

8665,"Hey, did you know that the Yankees don't wear cotton jerseys?","Of course, they're polyester."
8666,"Well, what is that? That's a crime! Do you know how hot those things get? They should be wearing cotton.",Why do they wear polyester?
8667,Why do they wear polyester?,I don't know. That's all gonna change.
8668,You're going to do something about it?,Why shouldn't I?

8674,Excuse me?,Nothing.
8675,"Hello, Karen? It's Jerry Seinfeld. Oh, that's very sweet of you. You know, you better be careful, you don't want to get too congenial. They'll slap that `Miss Congeniality`on you, and you'll congene yourself right out of the contest. So, what time do you want to get together later? What? So what, we don't need the chaperone. The chaperone can't make it. Oh, you're not gonna get disqualified! So, we're not going?  Hold on one second. Hey, what are you doing tonight?",Nothin.'

8684,How's everything going? Everything O.K.?,"Well, all of a sudden there's a problem with Tartabull's swing..."
8685,How so?,"Well, they get very hot in the polyester. You know, it's not a natural fibre. I think they would prefer cotton."
8686,"Cotton, huh?","Yeah. Cotton breathes, you see, it's much softer. Imagine playing games and your team is five degrees cooler than the other team. Don't you think that would be an advantage? They're cooler, they're more comfortable...they're happier - they're gonna play better."
8687,"Yeah. Cotton breathes, you see, it's much softer. Imagine playing games and your team is five degrees cooler than the other team. Don't you think that would be an advantage? They're cooler, they're more comfortable...they're happier - they're gonna play better.","You may have something there, George."

8692,"If you we're Miss America, what would you do to make the world a better place?","As Miss America, I would try and bring an end to world hunger. If every person sacrificed one meal a week, there would be enough to feed the whole world!"
8693,What advice would you give young people?,"Alright, Kramer!"
8694,"You really know a lot about this, don't you?","Oh yeah, like last year? Miss Texas? Now, she should have won easily, but she lost points in the swimsuit competition."
8695,"Oh yeah, like last year? Miss Texas? Now, she should have won easily, but she lost points in the swimsuit competition.","Well, what could she have done?"
8696,"Well, what could she have done?",Tape her breasts together.

8698,"So, what's your talent?",Magic.
8699,"Is it my imagination, or do the Yankees look a little different tonight? I can't put my finger on it...","Well, from what I understand, they've switched to cotton uniforms."

8701,No good?,Disaster.
8702,Why?,"Well, you got brown eyes. You want to wear a green dress."

8721,Tomorrow?,Yes.

8723,"No. Alright, watch me now. Turn, back, head up, shoulders back...posture. You see? Posture.","Yes, I see. O.K."
8724,"Let's try a few more questions, alright?  If you we're Miss America, and the U.S. was on the brink of a nuclear war, and the only way the conflict could be averted was if you agreed to sleep with the enemy's leader, what would you do?","Kramer, are these questions really that important...?"
8725,"Kramer, are these questions really that important...?","Yes, they're important! If you stumble, if you hesitate, you can kiss the crown goodbye. Now if I've told you once, I've told you a thousand times - poise counts! It's just as important as the others. Swimsuit! Evening wear! Talent! POISE!"
8726,How was the show?,Good. How was the roulette?
8727,Good. How was the roulette?,"I won fifty bucks! Boy, this is great. Too bad Elaine's not here."
8728,But what??,Ultimately I don't think they'll stay up.
8729,"Oh, forget about those!  Why do you keep mentioning those?",What do you want!?

8735,How did this happen?,"They like it outside, so I kept them in a cage on the terrace...then I found them dead in a pool of water!"
8736,"Well, how did this happen?",It must have been an accident.
8737,Accident? This was no accident. These doves we're murdered.,"Well, that's it! She's out of the pageant!"
8738,What? Why? What happened?,Her birds are dead.
8739,Birds?,"Yeah, birds. She's got these trained doves, she does this magic act, that was her talent for the pageant. You know what I think, Jerry? I think somebody murdered those doves. Somebody wanted her out of that contest bad. Somebody who was just eaten up with jealousy. Somebody who just couldn't stand to have the spotlight taken off of them!"
8740,"Yeah, birds. She's got these trained doves, she does this magic act, that was her talent for the pageant. You know what I think, Jerry? I think somebody murdered those doves. Somebody wanted her out of that contest bad. Somebody who was just eaten up with jealousy. Somebody who just couldn't stand to have the spotlight taken off of them!","What are you looking at?  Oh, that! We had to leave that outside, last night, because the water was making the room too cold."
8741,"What are you looking at?  Oh, that! We had to leave that outside, last night, because the water was making the room too cold.","You killed them, didn't you?"
8742,"You killed them, didn't you?","No, you don't understand - it's not what you think! It was an accident!"
8743,What was that all about?,"Oh, it was just Kramer...apparently I killed Miss Rhode Island's doves with a bucket of water last night."
8744,How ya feelin'?,I'm a little nervous!
8745,"What is with the Yankees? They look like they're having trouble running, they can't move!","It's their uniforms, they're too tight, they've shrunk! They're running like penguins! Forget this game!"

8761,What big salad? I'm going to the coffee shop.,They have big salads.
8762,Is that what I ask for? The BIG salad?,"It's okay, you don't"
8763,"No, no, Hey I'll get it. What's in the BIG salad?","Big lettuce, big carrots, tomatoes like volleyballs."
8764,Dating is really starting to get embarrassing isn't it?,"I know. You know, whenever I'm on a date I feel people can tell."
8765,What was that?,"That Gendason, what a jerk. I'm never playing golf with him again."
8766,Who Gendason?,Steve Gendason.
8767,Why is that name familiar?,He used to be a baseball player.
8768,"Oh, how did you end up playing golf with him?","Well, I met him on the course a couple of years ago. Yeah. Played with him a lot. But today was it! We're on the fifteenth hole, ya, he's beating me by a couple of strokes. Then, he's about to hit his second shot, when, he picks up the ball and CLEANS it."
8769,So what?,"Umph, sorry! But the rules clearly state that you cannot clean the ball unless it's on the green. The rules are very clear about that."
8770,I like Anna Quindlen's column and Safire. Don't you like Safire?,"Oh, Safire. Uh ha"
8771,"Oh, you're very welcome. So, I guess I better get going. Gotta meet mother a t the Guggenheim. Sure you don't want to go?","No, you go Guggenheim. I'm not much of a Guggenheim."
8772,Did you see what just happened?,"Well, that all depends..."
8773,Did you happen to notice that Julie handed the big salad to Elaine?,"Yeah, so?"
8774,"Yeah, so?","Well, she didn't BUY the big salad. I bought the big salad."
8775,Is that a fact?,Yes it is. She just took credit for my salad. That's not right.
8776,You think she should have said something?,She could have.
8777,What?,I'm puttin it on
8778,So did you enjoy your lunch?,"Yeah, A big salad. Very good. Actually it was too big. Ha ha ha Wht?"
8779,"Yeah, A big salad. Very good. Actually it was too big. Ha ha ha Wht?","oh, ...because she handed you the bag. I could have handed you the bag. She happened to pick it up at the restaurant even though, ..."
8780,Even though what?,"... naw, it's just you thanked HER, and and oh, ... what's the difference?"
8781,"... naw, it's just you thanked HER, and and oh, ... what's the difference?","What? What are you trying to say, George?"
8782,"What? What are you trying to say, George?",It's just that I was the one who actually paid for the big salad. She just happened to hand it to you. But it's no big deal.
8783,"You want the money for the big salad, George?","No, no,"
8784,What is the problem?,There is no problem... just a small miscommunication. Whereby you thanked her instead of the person actually responsible for purchasing the big salad.
8785,Why not?,We don't need a bunch of people staring at us.
8786,Who is staring?,"Oh, they're staring. They know we're on a date. They're making fun. Come on. It's embarrassing."
8787,"No, no I don't. Why?","You know, Genderson. This is something big."
8788,What did Kramer say?,I don't know. Nothing.?

8794,"You liked, Newman?",Look I'm a little uncomfortable talking about this okay?
8795,Look I'm a little uncomfortable talking about this okay?,"No, I'm sorry. I'm just a little curious. I mean why did you stop seeing him."
8796,... HE ended it?,YES!! Yes! It was a couple of years ago. Why does it matter?
8797,YES!! Yes! It was a couple of years ago. Why does it matter?,"No, no of course not."
8798,What tee?,A golf tee. In the dry cleaner.
8799,"No. It isn't and the most distressing part of it is, not that she went out with him but that HE stopped seeing her. Do you understand? He, Newman; Newman stopped seeing her. Newman never stopped seeing anybody. Newman will see whoever is willing to see him. Not so much why she did see him as disturbing as that is. But why, did HE, Newman, stop seeing her?",Perhaps there's more to him than meets the eye.
8800,Would you like some more coffee?,"No,, but thank you."
8801,"Well, what did you do that for? You ordered it.",To please Mr. MR. PITT.
8802,"Hi, how are you, Elaine? I'm meeting George here.","Oh, Well then I better get going otherwise George will make me buy him lunch to make up for that big salad he bought me yesterday."

8824,"Well, my question is, How could Elaine be under the impression that you bought the big salad, when I was the one who handed it to her?","Well, she probably just assumed."
8825,"Um, did she?","...uh, ... wait a second. Are you suggesting that I went out of my way to tell Elaine that even though you handed her the big salad, that it came from me?"
8826,"...uh, ... wait a second. Are you suggesting that I went out of my way to tell Elaine that even though you handed her the big salad, that it came from me?",That's what I'm suggesting.

He escaped and the police spotted him on the New Jersey Turnpike.","As you can see white Bronco. The police have cleared the highway traffic in front of him but they are keeping their distance and don't want the situation to escalate.

8839,She was hitting on you? My friend Noreen?,"Your friend, Noreen."
8840,Are you sure you're not just flattering yourself?,"If I was flattering myself, I think I'd come up with someone a little less annoying than Noreen."
8841,"I will. Besides, she's got a boyfriend, Jerry, you know him. Dan. Remember, we went to that party at his house?","Oh, right. The guy who talks with a really high voice."
8842,"Jerry, did you get my Fortune magazine in your mail?",Check the pile.
8843,"Oh, who sent you a card?",I don't know.
8844,Who's Kristin?,"She works for PBS, I met her when I agreed to do that pledge drive."
8845,Did you ask her about me?,"Yeah, in fact she said that you could be one of those people that sits in the back and answers the phone."
8846,"Giddy-up! Alright! So now, how does that work? Now, what, I get a percentage of every pledge I bring in, right?","No, it's not aluminum siding, it's volunteer work. All the money goes to the station."
8847,"Okay, yeah, alright, that sounds good, but I still get a tote bag though, right?","Yeah, and one of those foam beer can holders."
8848,You know what I'm doing? I'm calling Noreen.,"Oh, go ahead."
8849,You sure you don't mind?,Like she's really going to admit she was flirting with me.
8850,Hello?,"Hi, it's Elaine. Listen, I was just talking to Jerry."
8851,Jerry?,Jerry Seinfeld.
8852,You mean like like?,What are you talking about?

8859,Is this Noreen?,What would ever possess you to make up a story like that.
8860,"Noreen, are you crying?","No, this is Dan!"
8861,Elaine? Work?,Tell Noreen I'll just call her back later.
8862,Who was crying?,"No one. I'm sorry Mr. MR. PITT, that won't happen again."
8863,"Well, it's a long story, okay? But my stupid friend Jerry told my other friend Noreen that she was--  You know, hitting on him and so I called her to see what was, uh, going on and I accidentally got her boyfriend, who is this, you know--","I'm Jerry Seinfeld, I tell jokes for a living, but there's no joking about the financial crisis at PBS. Show us you care. Call in your pledge now."
8864,You got the card I sent?,I did.
8865,So where is it?,What?
8866,What?,The card. Is this it in the trash?
8867,The card. Is this it in the trash?,No?

8869,"Why, because I threw the card out? How long was I supposed to save it?",You have no sentimentality.
8870,"Well, but, you see, I saved something! See? I can save. I'll see you at the pledge drive, ok?","New cards, huh?"
8871,"New cards, huh?","No, they're old cards from my grandmother."

8875,You making that up or do you know what you're talking about?,I'm making it up.
8876,"I mean really, what's the point of saving it? I could see if I had a mantel.","Oh, we'll, a mantel's a whole different story."
8877,Could you?,Alright. I'll run it by a few people.
8878,"Hey, did you ever get to talk to Noreen?","Yes, she's very upset."
8879,So was I right about the flirting? Was it true?,"I don't know, I never asked. She was yelling--"
8880,Who was flirting with you?,"Remember when we we're in the bookstore, that woman came up to us?"
8881,"Remember when we we're in the bookstore, that woman came up to us?",She wasn't flirting with you.
8882,"Oh, sure she was; Asked me where the 'humor' section was? Humor? Come on.","Jerry, her brother just had a book of political cartoons published."
8883,"Alright, so maybe she wasn't flirting with me. So what?","So, yeah, that's funny. Hey, you wanna hear something weird? Mr. MR. PITT eats his Snickers bars with a knife and fork."
8884,"So, yeah, that's funny. Hey, you wanna hear something weird? Mr. MR. PITT eats his Snickers bars with a knife and fork.",Really?
8885,Really?,Yeah.
8886,Why does he do that?,He probably doesn't want to get chocolate on his fingers. That's the way these society types eat their candy bars.
8887,"What, you think I eat all my meals with you?  Excuse me, sweetheart? I think you may have overcharged us. What is this?",That's the extra toast. Get it?
8888,That's the extra toast. Get it?,Got it. Did you just see what happened here?
8889,Got it. Did you just see what happened here?,What?
8890,What?,Did you see the way she pointed at the check? She gave me the finger.
8891,Did you see the way she pointed at the check? She gave me the finger.,That's how waitress types express derision. They don't want to get their mouths dirty.
8892,"So, what do you think?","A PBS fundraiser? I'm not gonna waste any of the players' time with that, besides the team already does so much promotion for channel eleven."
8893,"A PBS fundraiser? I'm not gonna waste any of the players' time with that, besides the team already does so much promotion for channel eleven.","Channel eleven? Forgive me for trying to class up this place, for trying to have the Yankees reach another strata of society that might not watch channel eleven."
8894,"Channel eleven? Forgive me for trying to class up this place, for trying to have the Yankees reach another strata of society that might not watch channel eleven.","Uh, what the he'll are you doing?"
8895,"Uh, what the he'll are you doing?","I am eating my dessert. How do you eat it, with your hands?"
8896,"I am eating my dessert. How do you eat it, with your hands?","You know, maybe George has something here about PBS."
8897,Huh? Yeah.,Hello?
8898,Hello?,"Hello, this is Chemical Bank. Just wanted you to know that your checking account is overdrawn."
8899,Chemical Bank? I haven't used that account in months.,"Well, someone's been cashing the checks and you're overdrawn."
8900,You got Danny Tartabull?!,"You wanted a Yankee, I got you a Yankee."

8908,What kind of checks?,I think Chemical Bank.
8909,Chemical?! She hasn't used that account since her branch closed. What are you doing cashing her checks anyway?,"Well, Kramer thought it would make her happy. I never should have cashed those checks!"
8910,"Your grandmother's on a very fixed income. What, are you broke?","Just call me if you hear anything. We'll? I cashed the checks, the checks bounced and now my Nana's missing!"
8911,"Just call me if you hear anything. We'll? I cashed the checks, the checks bounced and now my Nana's missing!","Well, don't look at me."
8912,My fault? Your Nana is missing because she's been passing those bum checks all over town and she finally pissed off the wrong people.,"So anyway, it's caused a lot of problems. Dan thinks I'm interested in Jerry, he won't let up."
8913,"No, why?","Well, you know, because he's a high talker."
8914,Really?,You don't think his voice sounds a lot like yours?
8915,You don't think his voice sounds a lot like yours?,I never noticed that.
8916,"Well, it's no big deal, you know, it's just that he can sound like a woman, you know?",Great. I'm going out with a man who sounds like a woman.

8921,Hey! Watch it! Did you see that guy? He just gave me the finger!,You sure?
8922,You sure?,"Oh yeah! Middle finger, straight up, at me! At us!"

8924,"Oh dear, that's my grandson. May I call him now and explain?","Oh, certainly."
8925,Would you?,Hello?

8927,Heh?,Any word from Nana?
8928,Any word from Nana?,No.
8929,Nana?,"Yeah, my grandma's missing."
8930,Missing?,Yeah. I think it might have something to do with those checks.
8931,"Um, what does Nana sound like?","Like a grandmother, why?"
8932,"Like a grandmother, why?",We'll...
8933,"Oh, you hung up on my Nana?!","I don't know, maybe."
8934,You told Nana to drop dead?!,It's possible.

8943,You know what? It sounds like the friend of Elaine's that was hitting on me in the book store.,"Jerry, I'll take care of it."
8944,Is Jerry in there?,"Well, he can't be disturbed now."
8945,What?,"Look, I'm not judging you. In fact, we here at PBS, we have many programs celebrating your lifestyle. Armistead Maupin's Tales of the City, Gender Bending and Swinging in San Francisco. Before Stonewall about those dark ages when you couldn't come out of the closet, lest you be persecuted because of your, you know."
8946,Are you Danny Tartabull?,"No, I'm not."
8947,What's the problem?,"I believe you cut me off, and then made an obscene gesture."
8948,I did? Where?,"Outside of Manhattan, about an hour ago."
8949,Wow! Is that Danny Tartabull?,"That's right, of the New York Yankees."
8950,"As long as you've got your checkbook out, how about forking a little over to PBS? You watch the station, don't you? You don't want to be a freeloader.","...programs like Ken Burns' Baseball. And if Danny Tartabull we're here, I'm sure he'd say, 'That's correct, Jerry.'"

9036,"Oh, he went insane?...","Believe it or not, Paul was convinced I was having an affair because somebody kept calling and hanging up whenever he answered! What kind of a sick person calls and hangs up over and over?"
9037,"Believe it or not, Paul was convinced I was having an affair because somebody kept calling and hanging up whenever he answered! What kind of a sick person calls and hangs up over and over?","We'll. Uh. I don't know about sick. I mean, maybe it was somebody who, didn't wanna talk to whoever was answering because whoever was answering was always making boring chit-chat, an' was completely oblivious to the fact that the person who was calling, didn't want to speak to them, ah!"
9038,...So you thought he was boring?,"Hey, Noreen, don't go by me! Ha ha."

9043,Tonight?,"Yeah--I just remembered, I'm gonna have to cancel my acupuncture class."
9044,"All right. Let me just say one thing there is no way that this is gonna happen. You hear me? No Way! Because if you think I'm going' to two Thanksgivings, you're out of your mind!!!",We're not getting divorced.
9045,You did?! That's Goood! That's very good! I'm very glad to hear that.,"Yeah, we worked it out."
9046,All right. So let me ask you a question. Who was the man in the cape?,He was my lawyer.
9047,Your lawyer wears a cape...?,Yeah. So what?
9048,Yeah. So what?,Who wears a cape?
9049,Who wears a cape?,He's very independent; he doesn't follow the trends.
9050,I have no eye for fashion?!?!?!,All right! Come on! Let's not fight.

9063,"Oh, what? Am I... tooo boring for you?",Alright--would you just put her on?
9064,Alright--would you just put her on?,"Well, I feel that it would be best that you didn't talk to Noreen for a while..."
9065,YOU feel?,"That's right! She an' I have had a very long talk. An' I was appalled to learn of the destructive influence you've had over her life, lo these many years..."
9066,"What, are you insane?!","From now on, I'll be calling the shots around here..."
9067,Uh! Ho-ho. An' what are YOU gonna tell her?,We'll. I've encouraged her to go back into the Army... There she'll get the structure an' the discipline she needs right now... And she'll have qualified officers telling her what to do...

9069,Long Island?!?! I thought I was gettin' advice from a Chinese woman!!,I'm sorry...?
9070,I'm sorry...?,We'll... then... that changes everything!

9082,"Oh, what about this one? Look at this, this is it! This is what I'm looking for. Oh, yeah!","Hey, what's going on?"
9083,"Hey, what's going on?","New couch, baby!"
9084,New couch? Why?,"I love this couch. You know what the best part about it is? It doesn't fold out, so no one can sleep over."
9085,"I love this couch. You know what the best part about it is? It doesn't fold out, so no one can sleep over.",Hello.
9086,What are you doing with your old couch?,"Nothing, the moving guys are taking it. Why, you want it?"
9087,"Nothing, the moving guys are taking it. Why, you want it?","Yeah, I'll take it."
9088,Ooh! Remember Poppie?,"Oh, you mean from Poppie's Restaurant?"
9089,"Oh, you mean from Poppie's Restaurant?","Yeah, yeah. Anyway, uh...we're going into business together. Remember that idea I had a few years ago about the pizza place where you make your own pizza?"

9091,What was that again?,"It's a pizza place where you make your own pie! We give you the dough, the sauce, the cheese...you pound it, slap it, you flip it up into the air...you put your toppings on and you slide it into the oven! Sounds good, huh?"
9092,"It's a pizza place where you make your own pie! We give you the dough, the sauce, the cheese...you pound it, slap it, you flip it up into the air...you put your toppings on and you slide it into the oven! Sounds good, huh?","Ooh, I can't wait to get me a fella and make mah own pie!"
9093,What made you resurrect that old idea?,"Well, I happened to be eating at Poppie's when I told him the `old`idea, and his eyes - waaaaaah! - just lit up. You know, he wants to back it."
9094,I'm not goin' there. Didn't he get busted by the Board of Health?,"That was in the past, Jerry. As it happens, New York Magazine just judged his kitchen to be one of the cleanest in the city. They got a duck there, you think you died and went to heaven."
9095,"Right there, guys. That's perfect. Ah? Whatta ya think, Lainie?","Well, I don't know. I'll have to sit on it."
9096,"Excuse me, I was wondering if would it be possible if you could deliver the old couch to my apartment? It's not very far.",Sure.
9097,"'Kay. You, uh...you got room in the truck for me?","Yeah, I think we can squeeze you in."

9102,You wanna know what I said?,I can't wait.
9103,Is that something?,Yes.
9104,Is that something?,"You're something. So anyway, when they we're in my house before, I didn't offer them anything to drink."
9105,"So, anyone sweaty comes into your house has to be offered a drink?",Yes.
9106,"Well, would you apologize for me?","Hello! Jerry, so good to see you again!"
9107,"So, what's good tonight?","Boy, I'm really looking forward to this duck. I've never had food ordered in advance before."
9108,Paccino's? Oh no. You should never order pizza from Paccino's.,Why not?
9109,Why not?,"Because, the owner contributes a lot of money to those fanatical, anti-abortion groups."
9110,"So, you won't eat the pizza?",No way.
9111,"Well, what if Poppie felt the same way?","Well, I guess I wouldn't eat here, then."
9112,"Well, perhaps we should inquire. Poppie! Oh, Poppie. Could I have a word?","Yes, Jerry. I just checked your duck...it is more succulent than even I had hoped."
9113,"Poppie, I was just curious...where do you stand on the abortion issue?","When my mother was abducted by the Communists, she was with child..."
9114,And what gives you the right to do that?,"The Supreme Court gives me the right to do that! Let's go Jerry, c'mon."
9115,"Oh, you really missed something. And I have to say...it was pretty much all my fault. So, how's the book coming?  I say, how's the book comin'?",Oh...pretty good.

9117,"Yes, you haven't read a page, have you?",No.
9118,"You're not very bright, are you?","No, I'm not. I would like to be, but I'm not. What am I gonna do? The book club meets in a few days."

9120,Why don't you rent the movie?,"'Why don't I rent the movie.' See, this is when I like you. Alright, now I'm relieved."

9123,"Alright, what did you do to Poppie?",Nothing.
9124,What's wrong with him?,I don't know! I'm gonna go and visit him later. It would be nice if you got him something.
9125,"Do you know that I have been using the same bottle of shampoo for a year? And I shampoo every day. So, what do you think of my conversation?","Not much!  I, uh, would have invited you up, but I don't have any furniture."
9126,You don't have any furniture?,"No, I hate furniture. I can't look at it."
9127,"Well, I can understand that. Pretty good date, huh?",Yeah! No heavy lifting.
9128,What's this? A bottle of wine and a five-alarm chili? They're trying to kill Poppie?!,"Why, what...?"
9129,"Why, what...?","Don't they know I have a gastro-intestinal disorder? If I would have any of this, I would die. Then Poppie's no good to anyone! This is a sick, sick joke on Poppie. How could you be friends with those two?"
9130,"Don't they know I have a gastro-intestinal disorder? If I would have any of this, I would die. Then Poppie's no good to anyone! This is a sick, sick joke on Poppie. How could you be friends with those two?","Well, we're not very close."
9131,"Oh, they got good ducks there, huh?","Oh, very good ducks."
9132,Did you tell him I was sorry I didn't offer him the drink?,"No, I forgot. And, the best part is, he doesn't play games. You know? There are no games!"
9133,"No, I forgot. And, the best part is, he doesn't play games. You know? There are no games!",No games? What is the point of dating without games? How do you know if you're winning or losing?
9134,No games? What is the point of dating without games? How do you know if you're winning or losing?,"Well, all I know is, he doesn't like games and he doesn't play games, you know? He has too much character and integrity."

9188,"I've never been able to figure out why they make these bizarre toilet seats that they have. You know, like those clear Lucite ones, with all the, the coins in it? It's a lovely tribute to our past president, by the way. It's not bad enough Lincoln got shot in the head, we gotta pull down our pants and sit on him, too. It's just incomprehensible that you would buy a thing like this, you install it on your toilet seat, and this says what about you? `Well, I can't afford to just throw money down the toilet, but look how close I am!`",I cannot believe Lindsay's still seeing you after that `Breakfast at Tiffany's`thing.
9189,"Oh, so you're gonna meet the mother?","Yeah, I'll zip in, `How do you do?`, zip out. She'll love me."

9195,"George, you wanna go for a ride?",Nah.
9196,"Hey, could you wait until the man finishes?","All right, I've had it with you two."

9212,"Kramer, Kramer, can you do this at home? I've got, I've got work to do, okay?","Oh, these are nice corners, huh?"
9213,"Oh, these are nice corners, huh?","Elaine, did I hear... Oh, this is very odd."
9214,"Yes, I've heard about these. How do they work?","Well, you blur your eyes like you're starin' straight through the picture. And you keep your eyes unfocused. And then... Oh, oh, oh, YEAH!"
9215,Ya' ever dream in 3-D? It's like the boogeyman is comin' right at you.,"A spaceship, where?"

9223,Can I offer you anything to eat?,"Oh, no no no, I'm fine. Let me help you with these dishes, huh?"
9224,"Oh, no no no, I'm fine. Let me help you with these dishes, huh?","Oh no, George, you don't have to..."
9225,Where is it?,Right here.
9226,"Hello? Oh, yeah, okay fine. Uh, he'll be right down. Car's here to pick you up and take you to the meeting.",Meeting?

9239,"Oh! Well, ah, what's in a name? I mean, water's water. Right?",We've got to do something about that name.
9240,"No, Lindsay, it was not IN the garbage. It was above the garbage. Hovering. Like an angel. Of course I know your aunt bit it. I kissed her goodbye. Listen, can I tell you something else? In my family, we used to eat out of the garbage all the time. It was no big thing. That's right. Oh, okay. Buh-bye. I'm back in, she gave me a second chance.",Good for you.
9241,"Y'know what you should do now? Get her some flowers, smooth it out.","Yes, flowers. I will get her flowers, I will go to the florist!"
9242,"Kramer, are you still on this? I've seen gymnasts. I know what they do. It's not going to make any difference.","Jerry, what is your problem?"
9243,"Jerry, what is your problem?","Kramer, y'know, guys like you, with no conscience, don't know what it's like for guys like me. I'm in the unfortunate position of having to consider people's feelings."
9244,"All right, Jerry--are you familiar with the Kama Sutra?",No.
9245,Tantric yoga?,No.
9246,"All right, all right, why don't we just watch the tape?",All right.
9247,Did you pass your stone yet?,Not yet. But the suspense is killing me.
9248,"Oh yeah. Oh yeah, that's her. Look at the height, Jerry, the extension! Now watch the tuck. Handstand, half-turn, giant into a straddle, back into another handstand. Nice kip. Reverse hecht. Oh, nice leg extension, good form! Now, here comes the big dismount. Look at the rotation, full in, double back, and she sticks the landing!  Perhaps you'd like to keep the tape?  Well, I'll take that as a yes.","Well, here we are."
9249,"How did you stay on that beam like that?  I mean, it's only this wide!",I can balance myself in any position.

9252,"Oh, come on. One thing? One thing! What?","We'll... Frankly, I thought, you know, I was gonna kinda' be like the apparatus."
9253,You mean like the uneven parallel bars?,"See, again, I really don't feel that..."
9254,The balance beam?,Could we stop?
9255,Could we stop?,Not the pommel horse?
9256,Not the pommel horse?,All right. Let's just drop it.

9263,"No, Lindsay, I had accidentally spilled coffee on the gentleman's windshield. Why would I do that? I have a job! Well, did she see a squeegee?

Buh-bye.",Strike two!
9264,You think I'm going down?,You're behind in the count.
9265,"Hey, what are you doing later?","I'm going out with Katya, thanks to you."
9266,"All right, where you going?",We're going to the circus. One of her old Olympic teammates is an acrobat. I don't even feel like going out.

9268,"Well, I couldn't help it. `Moland Spring`?",I like the name `Moland`. I picked it out. After all those months of negotiating!

9284,"Oh, why not?",It has been three days since our night together. Misha said that was all the time I needed to put in.
9285,Really?,"In my country, they speak of a man so virile, so potent, that to spend a night with such a man is to enter a world of such sensual delights most women dare not dream of. This man is known as the `Comedian`. You may tell jokes, Mr. Jerry Seinfeld, but you are no Comedian."
9286,"O.K. Cowboys,  What'll you have?","I'll have the, ah, turkey club without the bacon."
9287,"Why, you think you can, beat me up?",You wouldn't want me to mess up the beautiful face of yours.

9291,"Why should she like me? Who am I? Huh, there's a million people to like.",The omelet. Damn.
9292,Maybe she could like me? Is it that far fetched? Maybe she sees something? Is it possible?,No.
9293,"Lannie, how was the trip?",What trip? You we're gone?
9294,What trip? You we're gone?,"I went to England ... with Mr. MR. PITT, for 5 days."

9311,"You didn't think I was really going to give you a suit, did you?","What, you're giving him this suit?"

9327,We'll let me ask you this. What exactly did you say when you asked her out?,"I said, would you like to go for a walk or something."
9328,What do you mean?,"We'll she got up to the line of scrimmage, didn't like the looks of the defense and changed the play."
9329,You did?,Yeah.
9330,And it was around this point that she mentioned the boyfriend?,"Yeah. ... Oh, you think because of what I said about the manure. I wa, wa, was just saying how it takes a negative thing, and puts it on a positive spin on it."
9331,So you don't think she really has a boyfriend?,"My honest opinion, I think she made it up."
9332,"Well then she's just a Liar, Isn't she?",Hey.
9333,"Aaa. We'll ... you want something to eat, don't you?","Ahh, no, no, no. You got me all wrong buddy. I am loving this no refrigerator. You know what I discovered? I really like depriving myself of things. It's fun. Very monastic."

9339,"Yeah, you wanna get that meal, don't you?","How about Mendys, ooh, ever been there?"
9340,"How about Mendys, ooh, ever been there?",No I haven't?

9350,What kind of soup did he get?,I don't know? Consomm or something.
9351,I don't know? Consomm or something.,"Consomm, hmm."
9352,What?,"Well, that's not really a meal Jerry. I mean, if he had gotten, Chicken Gumbo, or Matzah Ball, even Mushroom Barley. Then I would agree with you. Those are very hardy soups."
9353,What?,"The meal is the act of sitting down with him. It doesn't matter what you get, as long as he's sitting in that restaurant, it's a meal."
9354,Was it a cup or a bowl?,"You see -- ah, uh ..."
9355,"A bowl, ok?",Did he crumble any crackers in it?
9356,Did he crumble any crackers in it?,"Did he crumble, any crackers in it?"
9357,"Did he crumble, any crackers in it?","As a mater of fact, he did."
9358,"Hello. Elaine, do you have any cash on you?","Um, yeah in my purse."
9359,"Well, I have some money. What do you need?","Well, 20 should cover me. Thanks mate."
9360,Where you going?,Just visiting.
9361,Pardon?,So is she working? Is she here?
9362,So is she working? Is she here?,"Yeah, yeah, she's here."
9363,Have you said anything to her?,"No, but I'm very uncomfortable."
9364,Are you going to say anything?,There she is. No no no no no no.
9365,"Well, what's it going to be?",What's it gonna be?

9376,What are you talking about? this isn't a meal.,Yes it is. Soup and sandwich. That is a meal.
9377,"Ah, soup and a sandwich for a brand-new Armani suit. Is that any kind of gesture?",I'm really not comfortable ...
9378,Where's Simon?,"Oh, he'll be right up. He's just getting some beer. And I'm not expecting ... any change."
9379,When's he leaving?,"About 2 days. Although he's hinting at how he'd like to stay. Fortunately he has no money, and no prospects."
9380,Hey mate. Fancy a beer?,"Ah, no thanks."
9381,"Hello? No, I'm sorry Bania ... I'm not going over this again. We'll who told you to order soup? ... No! There's no dinner. There's not going to be any dinner. You've had a sandwich and 2 bowls of soup and that's it. Good-bye.","Hey, what size suit are you?"
9382,"Hey, what size suit are you?",40
9383,"40. Perfect. Brand-new Armani suit, you want it?",Absolutely.

9386,"Good, ah,  what's going on?",Nothing.
9387,"You want food, don't cha?","It's not for me. It's for Hilde -- the waitress I was telling you about. She's hungry, she wants food. If I go back in there without any food ... there's gonna be trouble."
9388,"Cheese is good. Yeah, what kind?","Uh, Swiss."
9389,What are we doing out here? Aren't we going to go in and eat?,I can't go in there. I'm too uncomfortable.
9390,"Oh, w-what are you saying? So we're not going to go in there anymore?","Hey, What are you doing out here?"

9392,What's the difference? Let's go to Reggies.,Reggies? I can't eat anything there.
9393,Reggies? I can't eat anything there.,It's the same menu.
9394,"They'll make you a Big Salad. What do you think, they're the only one's that make a Big Salad?","All right. Let's go, to Reggies."
9395,So what's going on with Simon? Did he leave?,Ahh ... wait till you hear this.
9396,"Oh, hi Hilde. Can I get an egg white omelet?",Did you read the menu?
9397,Did you read the menu?,"All right, just give me a western."
9398,How bout a Big Salad?,A big salad?
9399,A big salad?,Ya see?
9400,Ya see?,"Just tell her whatcha want, they'll make it for ya."
9401,Could you put it in a big bowl?,We don't have big bowls.
9402,If only she could get fired. Is there any way that could happen? I mean I know how to get myself fired.,You're the best.
9403,We'll ...... but how do I get someone else fired?,"We'll as I see it, you've got to apply the same principles that get you fired, but redirected, outwardly."
9404,No food? We'll you gotta have something --  -- I can't go back in there with no food. She's expecting something Jerry. You don't know what she's like when that blood sugar drops.,Food!
9405,Why'd she get fired?,"Oh, because I called over there a couple of times and the manager didn't like it."
9406,"Boy, he's a real bounder, isn't he?",Yes. He's one of those bounders.
9407,"Hey Jerry, where's my suit?",I don't have it. You want half my omelet?
9408,I don't have it. You want half my omelet?,"'S MANAGER,I told you, she's busy. She can't come to the phone now!"
9409,When are you leaving?,"Elaine, are you trying to get rid of me? Aha ha ha ha ha ha ha. I was supposed to leave tomorrow, but all of a sudden, I've been set up with a job interview that might enable me to extend my visit indefinitely. And it is all due, to this suit. How do I look? I'm a shoe-in aren't I. Thanks again love."
9410,"Elaine, are you trying to get rid of me? Aha ha ha ha ha ha ha. I was supposed to leave tomorrow, but all of a sudden, I've been set up with a job interview that might enable me to extend my visit indefinitely. And it is all due, to this suit. How do I look? I'm a shoe-in aren't I. Thanks again love.",Hey Kenny. You still want to get that suit back?
9411,Hey Kenny. You still want to get that suit back?,Yeah!
9412,What are you doing? Unhand me!,Take It Off!
9413,"George, are you sure I can't show you any other cars?","I don't think so, Vic. I've done my homework. '89 Volvo, that's the car for me, it's the one I want."
9414,Jon Voight?,"Okay, Tim. You're welcome."
9415,Was that Tim Whatley?,"Yes, it was. He wanted your address - you, my friend, are going to be invited to his night-before-Thanksgiving party. You know, he's got that great apartment on 77th street, and they overlook where they inflate all those huge balloons for the Macy's Thankgiving Day Parade?"
9416,"Yes, it was. He wanted your address - you, my friend, are going to be invited to his night-before-Thanksgiving party. You know, he's got that great apartment on 77th street, and they overlook where they inflate all those huge balloons for the Macy's Thankgiving Day Parade?",I have always had a big crush on Tim Whatley. Why can't he ask me out?
9417,I have always had a big crush on Tim Whatley. Why can't he ask me out?,"Oh, he's a dentist. You don't want to go out with a dentist."
9418,Why?,"He'll always be criticizing your brushing technique, it'll drive you crazy. Away from the gums..."
9419,Hey! Did you get the Volvo?,"No, I decided to go with an '89 LeBaron."
9420,A LeBaron?,I thought Consumer said Volvo was the car.
9421,What Consumer? I'm the consumer.,Alright. Seems like...a strange choice.
9422,Jon Voight? The actor?,That's right. He just happened to be the previous owner of the vehicle.
9423,You bought a car because it belonged to Jon Voight?,"No, no..."
9424,"Jerry, you know that shoe repair place at the end of the block? Well, if they don't get some business, they're gonna have to shut down and make way for one of those gourmet coffee or cookie stores.",I like coffee.
9425,"Yeah, of course you do. And do you know why? Because you're a bunch of yuppies. It's your go-go corporate takeover lifestyles that are driving out these Mom and Pop stores and destroying the fabric of this neighborhood.","Well, what's so great about a Mom and Pop store? Let me tell you something. If my Mom and Pop ran a store, I wouldn't shop there."
9426,"Well, what's so great about a Mom and Pop store? Let me tell you something. If my Mom and Pop ran a store, I wouldn't shop there.","Hey, Bogambo - they've been in the neighborhood for 48 years. Now, come on, Jerry. You've gotta have a pair of shoes in need of a cobblin.'"
9427,"Well, what about sneakers? You know, they'll clean 'em. They do complete detailing.","Alright, take 'em."
9428,"We'll you know, these sneakers, they belong to my neighbor, Jerry Seinfeld? The comedian.",So many sneakers!
9429,What's the matter?,"Oh, I keep getting these nosebleeds."
9430,"Yeah. Hey, what's with your ceiling?",What?
9431,What?,"Well, you got wires sticking out every which way. That looks dangerous, you should call the electrician."
9432,Elaine?,"Yes, Mr. MR. PITT?"
9433,"Yes, Mr. MR. PITT?",Have you gotten all the salt off those pretzels yet?
9434,Have you gotten all the salt off those pretzels yet?,"No, I'm still working on it."
9435,What in blazes are you listening to?,Artie Shaw. `Honeysuckle Jump.`
9436,Elaine! How did you know that?,"Oh, my father used have a huge collection of big band records."
9437,Could you identify the next song? Could you? Could you?,"Mr. MR. PITT, why would you want to hold onto the ropes on the Woody Woodpecker balloon?"
9438,"Mr. MR. PITT, why would you want to hold onto the ropes on the Woody Woodpecker balloon?",My father was a stern man. He forbad us to participate in any activities that he thought we're associated with the common man. The Thanksgiving Day Parade was first on the list.
9439,"Well, Elaine? Do you know it? What song is it?",Will you shut up? I can't hear!
9440,Will you shut up? I can't hear!,I'm sorry!
9441,What do you mean `might`? You don't think he really owned this car?,I don't know.
9442,"Well, why would the guy make up something like that? Of all the names he could pick, why settle on Jon Voight?","Don't you see, that's the genius of it. If he had said Liam Neeson, you'd know he's making it up."
9443,"Neeson? How are you comparing Liam Neeson with Jon Voight? Jerry, we're talking about Joe Buck. If you can play Joe Buck, Oskar Schindler's a cake walk.","Oh, look at this, I stepped in gum."
9444,Kramer!  Hey! Where's all my sneakers?,You said take 'em.
9445,Obviously. So what am I supposed to wear?,"Jerry, I left you a pair right here... C'mon. There, put on those boots."
9446,"Well, why not?",They're uncomfortable.
9447,Where did you get those?,"I worked a club in Dallas one time and they couldn't afford to pay me so they gave me these. Oh, I can't wear these!  They look ridiculous!"
9448,"Ah, you look like a cowboy! Huh?",But I don't wanna be a cowboy!
9449,"Oh, stop it. You know that friend of yours, Tim the dentist? I got an invitation to his Thanksgiving Eve party.","Yeah, I got one too."
9450,Yeah?,Oh yeah? Huh.
9451,Oh yeah? Huh.,What?
9452,What?,"No, nothing."
9453,"No, what is it?","No, it's just that I, uh...didn't get one."
9454,You didn't get one?,"Ah, but he called me up and he asked for yours and Elaine's addresses, I'm sure that means I'm invited."
9455,"Hey, why would you call someone up and ask them for two addresses if you're not invited to the party?",That's the genius of it.
9456,Four thousand dollars? We can't afford that!,"We'll I'm afraid you're gonna have to do something about it, because it's in violation of the building code. Otherwise, they're gonna close you up."
9457,But what if we can't pay for it?,"Then I have to report you. Otherwise, I lose my license. Sorry."
9458,"Afternoon, Mom! Afternoon, Pop. You know you got a crack in the sidewalk out there? Now, you oughta get that fixed.",So?
9459,So?,"C'mon, put the top up, it's November!"
9460,With Jon Voight's teeth marks. Owner's manual...you know what? This car was owned by Jon Voight.,Ah! See? I told ya.
9461,Ah! See? I told ya.,Except Jon is spelled with an H. J-O-H-N.
9462,So?,Doesn't Jon Voight spell his name J-O-N?
9463,Doesn't Jon Voight spell his name J-O-N?,"So, what are you saying?"
9464,"So, what are you saying?",Nothing. I'm sure `Jon`probably mispelled his own name. I know sometimes I spell Jerry with a G...and an I!
9465,What?,"That's right, you heard me. Get out! You are ruining this whole experience for me!"
9466,"Hey, cowboy. Where's your horse?  Yeah, you better run!",Did they take anything?
9467,Did they take anything?,"No, they didn't even touch me. I tripped because of these stupid cowboy boots."
9468,"How would you find out something like that...wait a minute, what am I thinking? I've got the entire Yankee organization at my disposal.",He'll dispose of it.
9469,"Ah! What'd you find out, Lois?","Well, I talked to Tim Whatley..."
9470,"And I asked him, `Should Jerry bring anything?`",So...?
9471,So...?,"Mmmm...and he said, `Why would Jerry bring anything?`"
9472,"Mmmm...and he said, `Why would Jerry bring anything?`","Alright, but let me ask you this question."
9473,What?,"Which word did he emphasize? Did he say, `Why would Jerry bring anything?`or, `Why would Jerry bring anything?`You emphasize `Jerry`or `bring.`"
9474,"Which word did he emphasize? Did he say, `Why would Jerry bring anything?`or, `Why would Jerry bring anything?`You emphasize `Jerry`or `bring.`",I think he emphasized `would.`
9475,"You know what? The he'll with this party, I don't even want to go to begin with.",Hey.
9476,"Hey, so where's my sneakers?",That's what I wanna know.
9477,What do you mean?,"Well, I saw Mom and Pop this morning, but when I went by the store on my way home? The place was empty. Everything is gone. Mom and Pop - vrooop - vanished."
9478,"Well, I saw Mom and Pop this morning, but when I went by the store on my way home? The place was empty. Everything is gone. Mom and Pop - vrooop - vanished.",So all my sneakers are gone?
9479,So all my sneakers are gone?,I'm afraid so. And that's just the tip of the iceberg. I've been asking around - they didn't even have any kids.
9480,Mom and Pop aren't even a Mom and Pop?!,"It was all an act, Jerry. They conned us, and they scored, big time."
9481,Where ya goin'?,I gotta go to the Dixieland Deli to pick up Mr. MR. PITT's security pass for the parade.
9482,Why does he want to hold a rope underneath Woody Woodpecker in the Thanksgiving Day Parade?,He finds his laugh `intoxicating.`
9483,"So George, what kind of promotional events are we talking about?","Well, I think we need more special days at the stadium, you know? Like, uh...Joe Pepitone Day. Or, uh...Jon Voight Day."
9484,"Well, I think we need more special days at the stadium, you know? Like, uh...Joe Pepitone Day. Or, uh...Jon Voight Day.","Jon Voight? The actor?  Uh, I make a motion that we have no more of these meetings that have been initiated by George Costanza."
9485,"Jon Voight? The actor?  Uh, I make a motion that we have no more of these meetings that have been initiated by George Costanza.","I suppose if I had suggested Liam Neeson Day, you'd all be patting me on the back."
9486,I guessed Stan Herman's `Boomtown Blues.`What'd you guess?,"Um, it was, uh...`Next Stop Pottersville.` Uh, do you know when they're giving out the passes?"
9487,"Um, it was, uh...`Next Stop Pottersville.` Uh, do you know when they're giving out the passes?",After the music.

9491,You going to the party?,"No, I don't know if I'm invited."
9492,You don't want to go with me?,"Jerry, for all I know this guy went out of his way to not invite you. How am I gonna feel if I show up with an uninvited, unwelcome intruder?"
9493,"Jerry, for all I know this guy went out of his way to not invite you. How am I gonna feel if I show up with an uninvited, unwelcome intruder?","The way I feel when I go places with you?  Hey, so'd you find my sneakers yet?"
9494,"The way I feel when I go places with you?  Hey, so'd you find my sneakers yet?","No. But I did run into somebody you might be interested in, a Mr. Jon Voight, the actor?"
9495,"No. But I did run into somebody you might be interested in, a Mr. Jon Voight, the actor?",Jon Voight! Are you kiddin' me? Did you talk to him?
9496,Jon Voight! Are you kiddin' me? Did you talk to him?,"Well, he was a little standoffish."
9497,"What, you didn't ask him about the car?","No, I couldn't, his cab pulled away. But he did, however, make an impression on me. Look."
9498,What?,His tooth marks. He bit me.
9499,Jon Voight bit you?,"Well, what is he, a vampire?"
9500,"Well, what is he, a vampire?","No, it's justifiable. He thought I was going for his wallet."
9501,"That he did. Now, you got that pencil with the bite marks on it? We get a trained eye to match 'em up, and we'll see whether or not you're driving Jon Voight's car!","Oh, please."
9502,"Why? Why isn't it possible? I mean, they're both bite marks.",So you're gonna show up at that party with a chewed-up pencil and Kramer's gnarled arm.
9503,"So, Kramer, you wanna go to the party together?","Jerry, look, come on, I'm an invited guest. I can't be aiding and abetting some...party-crasher."

9524,"Jon Voight, the actor?",No. The periodontist.
9525,Can't this wait until Monday? Come by my office.,Just a quick peek. I'm in agony.
9526,"Hey, who invited you, anyway? You're a troublemaker!","Hey, it looks like Woody Woodpecker is running out of air. In fact, he's collapsing."
9527,Especially that big kid up in the front. How old is he?  Hello?,"Hello, is this Jerry Seinfeld?"
9528,"Hello, is this Jerry Seinfeld?",Yes it is.

9535,I thought we we're going to the movies?,All right I'll try it on again. You tell me what you think.
9536,Because you didn't have a job?,"Perhaps. I walk in, everything is organized -- messages, appointments. And I can't tell you how proud I am of myself for going with Ade."
9537,We'll whad you buy it for?,"Why did I buy it, because in the mirror, at Barneys, I looked fabulous. This woman was just walking by said I looked like Demi  Moore in Indecent Proposal."

9612,Twice? I wanna go twice.,"all right let's be reasonable, Bania. I'm taking you out for a nice dinner. All I want is a little ticket in that pocket. I think it's a pretty good deal."
9613,"But Mr. Steinbrenner, how can I be expected to perform my job properly, knowing that my uh, subordinate is making more money than I am? With all due respect sir, it's outta whack.","Uh huh, I understand what you're saying George and I know what it's like to be financially strapped. When I was a young man in Cleveland I use to hitchhike to work. One time I got picked up by a bakery truck. You think that stuff smells good? Try being cooped up in the back of one of those babies."
9614,"Uh huh, I understand what you're saying George and I know what it's like to be financially strapped. When I was a young man in Cleveland I use to hitchhike to work.

9620,"I told you Mendys had the best pea soup. The best Jerry, the best. Are you enjoying it?",Yeah. I'm having a wonderful time.
9621,"Wait till you try the swordfish. You know Jerry, I was thinking. For our next meal, do you think we should come here ... or should we go someplace else? You know it has it's pros and cons. On the one hand, here, you're guaranteed a great meal. On the other hand --","Yeah, yeah I know. This would be good, but it would be the same. But if we go some place else, it would be different, but it might not be as good. It's a gamble. I get it."
9622,"Oh, and who might that be?",Some woman named Uma. I got her number off of that ticket before it was smudged. Hope she's good-looking.
9623,"If you are a waitress and you ever see me in a restaurant, I'm telling you right now, I don't want to hear about the specials. I don't want to know about the specials. I'm sick of the specials. I hate the specials. My feeling is, if the specials we're so special, they'd be on the menu. You know what's special about them? They don't know if anybody likes them. They always have these overly creative descriptions of the specials too, you know. The veil is lightly slapped, and then sequestered in a one-bedroom suite with a white wine intravenous.",Ready to go Lois?

9639,What's that?,"Mr. Bevilacqua, the gym teacher."
9640,Really?,And I had won by so much a myth began to grow about my speed. Only Duncan suspected something was a miss. He's hated me ever since. Now he's back.
9641,We'll what happened when you raced him again?,I never did. In four years of high school I would never race anyone again. Not even to the end of the block to catch a bus. And so the legend grew. Everyone wanted me to race. They begged me. The track coach called my parents. Pleading. Telling them it was a sin to waste my god given talent. But I answered him in the same way I answered everyone. I chose not to run.
9642,So now Duncan is back?,He's back. And I knew he would be someday. Man that's some tart cider!
9643,"Oh, so am I . Uh, how's Duncan?",He's okay.

9651,So you lied to her?,I couldn't tell her the truth. I don't know what's going to happen between us. What if we have a bad breakup. She'll go straight to Duncan. And I want him to go to his grave never being certain I got that
9652,"Yeah, that's pretty cool isn't it?","Hey, did I tell you I called one of those girls from the personal ads in The Daily Worker?"

9657,What's up?,Duncan wants to get together with her and me for lunch tomorrow. He obviously wants me to admit I got a head start. And I don't think she believes me.
9658,He wants to meet you? I'll tell you what. I'll show up. He doesn't know we're friends. I'll pretend I haven't seen you since High School. I'll back up the story.,That's not bad.

9675,What do you do?,I'm an architect.

9680,You we're there?,"Yes, sure, surely was. Yeah, I'll remember that day. We'll I'll never forget it because that was the day that I uh, lost my virginity to Miss. Stafford, the uh, voluptuous home room teacher."
9681,Miss Stafford?,"Yes, yes, you know I was in detention and she came up behind me while I was erasing the blackboard ..."
9682,Did I get a head start?,"Head start, oh no absolutely not."
9683,You satisfied? So you see?,"No, I'm still not convinced and I never will be."
9684,Why don't the two of you just race again?,That's a good idea.
9685,What does that mean?,"Well, if you've got needs and abilities that's a pretty good combination."
9686,So what if I want to open up a delicatessen?,There are no delicatessens under Communism.
9687,Why not?,"Well, because the meats are divided into a class system. You got Pastrami and Corned Beef in one class and Salami and Bologna in another. That's not right."
9688,So you can't get Corned Beef?,"Well, you know, if you're in the Politburo, maybe."
9689,". It's George Costanza. . are there any messages for me? Why does Mr. Steinbrenner want to see me in his office? ... Communist? I'm not a Communist ... . All right, all right.

10619,Who would order a license plate that says `Assman`?,Maybe they're Wilt Chamberlain's.
10620,"Have you ever *met* a proctologist? Well, they usually have a very good sense of humor. You meet a proctologist at a party, don't walk away. *Plant* yourself there, because you will hear the funniest stories you've ever heard. See, no one wants to admit to them that they *stuck* something up there. Never! It's always an accident. Every proctologist story ends in the same way `It was a million to one shot, Doc. Million to one.`",Oh! There's my phone.
10621,"Hey, what's the story? I hear you're doing my move.",What move?
10622,What move?,What move? *My* move. The one I told you about. You used it on Elaine.
10623,What move? *My* move. The one I told you about. You used it on Elaine.,"You're move? What, are you kidding? I was doing that before I knew you. All you told me about was the ending."
10624,"You're move? What, are you kidding? I was doing that before I knew you. All you told me about was the ending.","The ending is the whole thing. Without the ending, it's nothing. You had *nothing*."
10625,"You can't come up with your own stuff , so you *steal* other peoples? You're nothing but a hack.","Are you through, 'cuz, uh, I gotta get back to work."
10626,"Ow, George!  What are you doing?","Uh...you know, uh...pleasuring you."
10627,You don't like the move?,No. I don't.
10628,What?!!,I can't do the move.
10629,What?,"Oh, he's ruined it for me."
10630,"Oh, oh, come on, please?","No, he called me a hack. I'm just not into doing it anymore."
10631,"Oh, so---so that's it?",I'll come up with some new stuff.
10632,"Now, is someone coming to pick you up?","Yes, my son's friend should be here any minute."
10633,Can I help you?,"Ah, yeah. Doctor Cosmo Kramer. Proctology."
10634,"Oh, really?","Oh, yeah. This takes twenty years off."
10635,Did he say `Assman`?,"Oh, yeah."
10636,You must have done *something* wrong. You probably screwed up the order. Did you close with the swirl?,Supposed to close with the swirl?
10637,Supposed to close with the swirl?,"Oh my god. Yes, you close with the swirl. There's a progression there. I told you to write it down."
10638,Yeah?,Elaine.
10639,C'mon up. You know what? Do me a favor. Don't even do the move anymore. You're gonna give it a bad name.,"Hello? Yeah, this is Jerry Seinfeld. What? Twenty-eight hundred dollars?!! That's the estimate on my car?!! No, don't even do anything. I'm gonna think about it. Okay, bye."
10640,"Hello? Yeah, this is Jerry Seinfeld. What? Twenty-eight hundred dollars?!! That's the estimate on my car?!! No, don't even do anything. I'm gonna think about it. Okay, bye.","What's to think about? If Putty says it's what it is, it's what it is. He's not gonna cheat you."
10641,"What's to think about? If Putty says it's what it is, it's what it is. He's not gonna cheat you.",Except that it's not Putty.
10642,What happened to Putty?,"Eh, we had a little fight about the move. I took her to this other place. I think they might be trying to screw me."
10643,"Well, of course they're trying to screw you. What do you think? That's what they do. They can make up anything. Nobody knows. `By the way, you need a new Johnson rod in there.``Oh, a Johnson rod. Yeah, we'll, you better put one of those on.`","Hey, Elaine."
10644,Is it something I said?,Yes! As a matter of fact! David Putty won't do the move anymore.
10645,Really?,"Oh, he's come up with some other move. You should see this thing."
10646,What is it?,"Oh, it's a lot of just fancy-shmancy stuff. You know what it's like? It's like a big budget movie with a story that goes *nowhere*."
10647,"Oh, it's a lot of just fancy-shmancy stuff. You know what it's like? It's like a big budget movie with a story that goes *nowhere*.",Huh.
10648,Let me ask you a question. This new move. Is there a knuckle involved in any way?,"Yes. As a matter of fact, there is."
10649,Listen. I need you to do me a favor. When's the next time you're gonna see him?,Why?
10650,Why?,You gotta get an estimate on my car from him. I think this garage is trying to screw me.
10651,An estimate? How am I supposed to do that?,"Well, look. Here's the work order with everything that broke. Just kind of bring it up at the right time and find out."
10652,What? What is this?,"That's, uh, Fusilli Jerry."
10653,Fusilli Jerry?,Yeah. Kramer made it.
10654,Shall we go?,Okay.
10655,"Getting an eye job like some Manhattanite, huh?","Well, it's already working. Kramer made a pass at me."
10656,Kramer made a pass at you? You're crazy.,I'm not crazy. He stopped short and made a grab.
10657,He stopped short? That's my move. I'm gonna kill him!,"Hey, let me ask you a question."
10658,What do you charge for blown shocks?,What?
10659,What?,"Two, three hundred?"
10660,"Two, three hundred?",I don't know. Maybe five hundred.
10661,What about a bad gasket?,Bad gasket?
10662,Bad gasket?,Yeah. Like a terrible gasket.
10663,What is all this?,"Nothing, nothing. I'm just taking an interest in what you...do."

10670,On---on your hand? Let me see what's on your hand.,Nothing. I don't know...just a little dirt.
10671,"Number one. Take her leg.... Oh, my god! Crib notes? You've got crib notes?!!",It's a very complicated move! I couldn't remember it all.
10672,"Assman? I'll get him, Assman!","Sixteen hundred dollars? That's all? *Ooh*, they are ripping me off."
10673,"Sixteen hundred dollars? That's all? *Ooh*, they are ripping me off.",So what are you going to do?
10674,So what are you going to do?,"Well, that's it. I'm going back to Putty. No move is worth this."
10675,Oh! You mean you don't care if he does the move anymore?,Are you kidding? He can do every move I've ever done! Do you know what a good mechanic is worth? You can't compare that to sex.
10676,Are you kidding? He can do every move I've ever done! Do you know what a good mechanic is worth? You can't compare that to sex.,"Hi, Mr. Constanza. What's uh...?"
10677,"Hi, Mr. Constanza. What's uh...?",Where's your friend Kramer?
10678,Where's your friend Kramer?,I don't know. Why?
10679,I don't know. Why?,Because I'm looking for him. That's why. He stopped short.
10680,What do you mean?,"In a car, with my wife. He stopped short. You think I don't know what that's about? That's my old move! I used it on Estelle forty years ago! I told everybody about it! Everybody knows!  Hmmph! I stopped short."

10686,Fusilli?,"You know, the corkscrew pasta. It was a Fusilli Jerry. It got stuck in me. Had to go to the proctologist."
10687,The proctologist? Are you okay?,Yeah.
10688,"What time does your flight get in? Six? All right, that gives us six hours. Then I'll meet you at the diplomat's club. I'll be the one without the big red sash. Okay, see you tonight.",Is that the supermodel?
10689,Is that the supermodel?,"Yep, she's not gonna be back for a month, but I got six hours."
10690,So that's it? You know I never even met the guy.,I've had enough. I am marchin' in.
10691,Really?,I'm marchin' in.
10692,How 'bout the march out?,Not as good. That's when you realize all the money you're losing.
10693,Why?,"Well, I wanna put a picture of me and my boss Mr. Morgan up at the office."
10694,What for?,"They're reorganizing the staff, and I'm on thin ice with this guy as it is."
10695,Isn't putting this guy's picture on your desk a little transparent?,It better be.
10696,"Elaine, you know what I just did? I just amended my will to include you as a beneficiary.",What?
10697,What?,"Well, I think of you as part of my family. You've come to be like a daughter to me and I want to make sure you're taken care of after I'm gone."
10698,"Elaine, I feel a cold coming on. Could you get me a cold pill from the medicine cabinet?","Oh no no, Mr. MR. PITT, you mustn't. You have to check with the pharmacy before you combine anything with your heart medicine,"
10699,"Look at this, I only have one picture left... How 'bout a shot of me and Mr. Morgan?",Why?

I turn and look and there is this monkey really laughing it up. Then someone tells me that he did it. Well, I pick up the banana peel and I wait for that monkey to turn around. And then I *whap* let him have it."

11233,"Yeah, so?",Oh I suppose it's O.K. for Leonard Burnstein to be called Maestro because he conducted the New York Philharmonic. So he gets to be called Maestro and I don't.
11234,Maestro huh? O.K.,Jerry! Jerry! Jerry! Jerry my burn is gone look..
11235,What do you mean?,"We'll I put that Chinese balm on that the Maestro gave me. And look, it healed it."

11242,"No I didn't mean to imply that you did. You're obviously a very we'll proportioned individual. I was just wondering, have they ever offered you a chair?",Nope.
11243,Would you like a chair?,I suppose if they gave me one I'd sit down.
11244,"Ah ha, Ah ha. You would, wouldn't you?","Obviously I'd rather sit than stand, if that's what your asking."
11245,We'll who wouldn't?,"'Cause I tell you, frankly, I would like to walk in hear one day and find you sitting down. That would give me a lot of pleasure. Call me crazy."
11246,"You put the balm on? Who told you to put the balm on? I didn't tell you to put the balm on. Why'd you put the balm on? You haven't even been to see the doctor. If your gonna put a balm on, let a doctor put a balm on.",I guess I screwed up huh Jackie?
11247,I guess I screwed up huh Jackie?,Your damn right you screwed up. Where the he'll did you get that damm balm anyway?
11248,Your damn right you screwed up. Where the he'll did you get that damm balm anyway?,The Maestro.

11252,Did you have a good time?,"Yeah, he's very interesting. Did you know that Mozart died while he was writing 'The Requiem'."
11253,Really?,So what about the `Maestro`stuff. Did he make you call him Maestro.
11254,You didn't mind?,"Well, I did at first, but actually I kind of got used to it."
11255,"What about his house in Tuscany, he mention that?",Yeah. I'm invited.

You a single man, George?","Well, I-I just recently uh..."
11489,"I'll tell you, if you wanna get something wild goin'on in your life, you get a girl and bring her to one o'these things. Just like 4 shots a wild turkey. She'll think you're Hopalong Cassidy. A show, about that Mickey Mantle, wasn't it? You know we used to talk. I don't think he liked me very much, you know.","All right. So, what theatre you wanna go to tonight?

11515,I gave you a taste. What do you want?,Why can't we share?
11516,Why can't we share?,"I told you not to say anything. You can't go in there, brazenly flaunt the rules and then think I'm gonna share with you!"
11517,Do you hear yourself?,I'm sorry. This is what comes from living under a Nazi regime.

11554,"Yeah. You know what I just realized? Suddenly, George has become much more normal than you.",Really?

11575,Por favor?,"Um, I'm part Spanish."
11576,"What about that Bavarian cream pie joke I told you? There's no truth to that.

11608,"Wait a second, Elaine. Where do you think you're going?",What do you care?
11609,What do you care?,"Elaine, I don't want you causing any trouble down at that soup stand. I happen to love that soup."
11610,"Look, they have it in blue...for my baby bluey. Are you my baby bluey?","Oh, yes. I - I'm your baby bluey."
11611,"Oh, really?",Mmm-hmm.
11612,Really?,"Yeah. Too bad, ''cause you gotta have the affection - which you obviously have. I think it's great that you're so open with your affections in public. See, we had that."

11620,My code?,So why didn't you tell her the code?
11621,So why didn't you tell her the code?,No. No way.
11622,So you're taking relationship advice from Chemical Bank now?,Why does everything have to be 'us'? Is there no 'me' left? Why can't there be some things just for me? Is that so selfish?
11623,Why does everything have to be 'us'? Is there no 'me' left? Why can't there be some things just for me? Is that so selfish?,"Actually, that's the definition of selfish."
11624,Have you ever given your code to anyone?,No one's ever asked. You want it? It's 'Jor-El.'

11650,Why would I wanna do that?,"Oh please, Jerry, please please please, I can't sit with him, he tells these stories, it's gonna be awful."

11926,Pardon?,"Nothing. Listen, I'm sorry, I just -"
11927,You don't mind that I got your number off the AIDS walk list?,"No, not at all. No problem."
11928,You went all night?,"Jerry, ah? Breakfast on me, huh?"
11929,"Jerry, ah? Breakfast on me, huh?","Kramer, are you out of your mind? You got the AIDS walk in like, three hours! You're never gonna make it!"
11930,"Kramer, are you out of your mind? You got the AIDS walk in like, three hours! You're never gonna make it!",AIDS walk! That's a cake walk. Hey!
11931,"So, George, guess what? Lena found out how I got her number.",Really? How'd she do that?
11932,Really? How'd she do that?,A friend of a friend of Susan's.
11933,My Susan?,Why'd you tell her?!
11934,Why'd you tell her?!,"Because, Jerry, it's a couple rule! We have to tell each other everything!"
11935,"We'll you know what this means, don't you?",What?
11936,What?,"You're cut off, you're out of the loop!"
11937,"You're cutting me off? No, no, no Jerry, don't cut me off!",You leave me no choice! You're the media now as far as I'm concerned!
11938,"If you we're in the mafia, would you tell her every time you killed someone?","Hey, a `hit`is a totally different story."
11939,"So, Lena was upset, huh?",You know what? That was the amazing thing.
11940,You know what? That was the amazing thing.,"What, it didn't bother her?"
11941,"What, it didn't bother her?","No, she said it was fine. There's something very strange about this girl."
11942,What?,She's too good.
11943,Where's the depravity?,"No depravity! I mean, I look at her, I can't imagine she even has sex."
11944,What?,Thanks again for last night!
11945,Sponge-worthy?,"Yeah, Jerry, I have to conserve these sponges."
11946,"But you like this guy, isn't that what the sponges are for?","Yes, yes - before they went off the market. I mean, now I've got to re-evaluate my whole screening process. I can't afford to waste any of 'em."
11947,"Uh, Cosmo Kramer?","Uh...o.k., you're checked in. Here's your AIDS ribbon."
11948,You don't want to wear an AIDS ribbon?,No.
11949,I have to?,Yes.
11950,You know what you are? You're a ribbon bully.,Hey you! Come back here! Come back here and put this on!
11951,"Make-up sex? You have to have that right after the fight, we're way past that.","Come on, just once?"
11952,"Come on, just once?","No, no...I hate the condom."
11953,Why?,I can never get the package open in time.
11954,"Hey, where's your ribbon?","Oh, I don't wear the ribbon."
11955,"Oh, you don't wear the ribbon? Aren't you against AIDS?","Yeah, I'm against AIDS. I mean, I'm walking, aren't I? I just don't wear the ribbon."
11956,"Yeah, I'm against AIDS. I mean, I'm walking, aren't I? I just don't wear the ribbon.",Who do you think you are?
11957,Who do you think you are?,Put the ribbon on!
11958,Who? Who does not want to wear the ribbon?,"So, you think you're sponge-worthy?"
11959,"So, you think you're sponge-worthy?","Yes, I think I'm sponge-worthy. I think I'm very sponge-worthy."
11960,Run down your case for me again...?,"Well, we've gone out several times, we obviously have a good rapport. I own a very profitable electronics distributing firm. I eat we'll. I exercise. Blood tests - immaculate. And if I can speak frankly, I'm actually quite good at it."
11961,You going to do something about your sideburns?,"Yeah, I told you...I'm going to trim my sideburns."
11962,And the bathroom in your apartment?,Cleaned it this morning.
11963,"The sink, the tub, everything got cleaned?","Everything, yeah. It's spotless."
11964,"Oh, hang onto that thought - I'm rinsing a sweater, I left the water running. Hey, Jerry, can you get me a towel out of my bedroom closet?","Oh, o.k."
11965,"Thanks. So, you we're saying...?",What? Nothing.
11966,What? Nothing.,"No, you said I was a good person..."
11967,"What is it, Jerry? You can tell me anything.","Oh, uh...you see these jeans I'm wearing?"
11968,"Oh, uh...you see these jeans I'm wearing?",Yeah.
11969,Would you wait a second? Just wait?,Give it to me. Come on. Come on!
11970,So! What's it going to be? Are you going to wear the ribbon?,No! Never.
11971,But I am wearing the ribbon. He is wearing the ribbon. We are all wearing the ribbon! So why aren't you going to wear the ribbon!?,This is America! I don't have to wear anything I don't want to wear!
11972,What are we gonna do with him?,I guess we are just going to have to teach him to wear the ribbon!
11973,"Well, I can see that. What do you have to do that for? Who cares about your pants size?",I don't wanna be a 32.
11974,That condom killed me. Why do they have to make the wrappers on those things so hard to open?,It's probably so the woman has one last chance to change her mind.
11975,"You never run out, do you?  Where's Kramer? Everything's finished here.","Oh, I told him he'd never make it. He was up all night! Oh my god...Kramer?"
11976,"Oh, I told him he'd never make it. He was up all night! Oh my god...Kramer?",Look at you. I told you. Up all night playing poker. Come on.
11977,"Hey, where's you AIDS ribbon?",Good morning.
11978,How'd you sleep?,Great. You?
11979,Great. You?,"Fine, fine. Everything o.k.?"
11980,"Fine, fine. Everything o.k.?",Yep.
11981,No regrets?,Nope. What are you doing?
11982,Nope. What are you doing?,What do you mean?
11983,What do you mean?,Oh...I don't think so.
11984,Why not? I thought you said everything was fine.,"I wish I could help you, but I can't afford two of 'em."
11985,You think she's happy?,Who?
11986,Who?,The cashier.
11987,Ruthie Cohen?,You know her name?
11988,You know her name?,Sure.
11989,What is this?,"Yeah, we'll, it's the latest offering from the Alex Theatre."
11990,That stinky old movie-house?,"Well, you should smell it now. We fixed up the place."
11991,With Spartacus?,"Well, it's a rare archival print. Twelve extra minutes, full wide-screen CinemaScope, and if you come to the one o'clock show, you can hear Geoffrey Har-harwood."
11992,Geoffrey who?,"Har-harwood, Jerry. He was the assistant wardrobe man on Spartacus. Some fascinating insights into the production."
11993,Why would I spend seven dollars to see a movie that I could watch on TV?,"Well, why go to a fine restaurant, when you can just stick something in the microwave? Why go to the park and fly a kite, when you can just pop a pill?  Listen, you guys haven't seen Lloyd Braun, have you? I'm supposed to meet him here."
11994,"Well, why go to a fine restaurant, when you can just stick something in the microwave? Why go to the park and fly a kite, when you can just pop a pill?  Listen, you guys haven't seen Lloyd Braun, have you? I'm supposed to meet him here.",Lloyd Braun? What d'you have to meet him for?
11995,Lloyd Braun? What d'you have to meet him for?,"Well, he's using his connections in the Mayor's office, to uh, get the theatre landmark status."
11996,"Well, he did. You know, after that, he had a nervous breakdown? Had to spend a few months in an institution.",Really?
11997,Really?,"Yeah, but he's doing a lot better now. I've taken him under my wing."
11998,"Breakdown, huh?",Hey Kramer.
11999,How you doing?,Sit down.
12000,"Hello, Lloyd. How you doing?","Yeah we'll, he's doing fine, George."
12001,Gum?,That's an interesting package.
12002,George?,I don't chew gum.
12003,"Mmm, different. Where'd you get it?",Friend of mine in Chinatown gave it to me. If you want I can ask him where he got it.
12004,You know what? I think this Ruthie Cohen gave me the wrong change. Didn't I pay with a twenty? I'm sure I paid with a twenty.,Hey.
12005,What kind is that?,"It's Chinese gum, Lloyd Braun gave me."
12006,Lloyd Braun? How's he doing?,"After Dinkins lost the election, he had a complete nervous breakdown. They had to lock him up."
12007,"You know, that's around the same time I broke up with Lloyd. Y... you don't think that I had anything to do with his breakdown, do you?","You know, I remember when we parted company, I was babbling incoherently for months."
12008,"Yeah? Well, I got news for you.","The whole time that I was growing up, all I ever heard from my mother was 'Why can't you be more like that Lloyd Braun?'"
12009,"The whole time that I was growing up, all I ever heard from my mother was 'Why can't you be more like that Lloyd Braun?'",And in the end Lloyd Braun became more like you.
12010,Aren't you coming with us to Spartacus?,"Nah, I gotta deliver some Christmas presents to my parents."
12011,I thought your parents we're outta town?,Why d'you think I'm going now?
12012,Why d'you think I'm going now?,Georgie!
12013,"Back in the old neighborhood, ah?","Yeah, yeah. Just delivering some presents to my folks."
12014,"Oh, snazzy car. Le Baron?","Yeah, eighty-three. Used to belong to John Voight."
12015,"The actor, right?",Something like that.
12016,Mind if I look under the hood?,"Oh, no no no no. Go ahead, Pop, you always knew your cars."
12017,"George Costanza, is that you?","Hey Deena, come on, give us a hug. Oh my gosh, you look as pretty as you did back in high school."
12018,"Yeah, yeah. Speaking of crazy, did you hear about Lloyd Braun?","The Alex was built in nineteen twenty-two, during the golden era of movie palaces. Minor restorations in nineteen forty-one, forty-seven, fifty-two, fifty-eight, sixty-three, and currently to our present period of time."
12019,"Boy, you're really getting into this aren't you?","Yes, yes I am. The icing on the cake would be getting that landmark status from the City. We're hoping Lloyd Braun can pull a few strings."
12020,"Oh, can Lloyd really do that?","Lloyd Braun can do anything he puts his mind to. He's fine, Jerry. And you should say hello to him, Elaine."
12021,What? Lloyd is here?,"What? No, no, I'd rather..."
12022,"What? No, no, I'd rather...",Hi Elaine.
12023,"Kramer tell you? We reserved some special seats, so we can all sit together.","Oh, we'll... I, uh, actually Lloyd, Jerry and I have to sit in the front row, uhm,  because uh, because, because he, he forgot his glasses. So uh, thanks for getting us... uhm, we'll see you afterwards."
12024,"That was odd. Am I crazy, or does Jerry not wear glasses?","You're not crazy. Jerry does wear glasses. He just forgot 'em, that's all. Not crazy."
12025,We're all the way in the front row. Why couldn't we sit in the special seats?,"I'm sorry, but I didn't want Lloyd thinking I was leading him on again. Seeing him made me feel very uncomfortable."
12026,Pop? What happened to Pop?,I thought you heard. He had a nervous breakdown last year. That's why I'm taking care of him.
12027,"He uh, he doesn't have the auto shop any more?","Uhn, it was too much for him."
12028,What?,"I just remembered, I gotta be someplace. Yuh-hu-hur, that's enough. Pop. Pop, put down the wrench, Pop."
12029,"'s a great movie, huh?",Yeah.
12030,How'd you like that gum?,Errh.
12031,"Hey Kramer, you know what? There, there isn't a light there, in the ladies' room.","Yeah, yeah. It's being repaired."
12032,You alright?,"Ah, I sat too close to the screen. Oh. I just gotta stretch out in a hot bath. It was nice to see you again, Lloyd."
12033,"Officer. Officer, is there some reason this man has to always be using a hose? I mean, he's flooding the sidewalk. It's a waste of water. Couldn't he just use a broom?","Lady, you sold me. Hey, you with the hose."
12034,"Well, what's this for?","Yeah, we'll Lloyd, he's gonna be here any minute now."
12035,So what?,"Well, he thinks you wear those."
12036,"Oh, I think so, and I can prove it. You see, I was doodling on the bill and uh, so if you have a twenty in there with big lips on it... we'll,  that's mine. Would you mind opening up the register?",Not unless you buy something.
12037,Hey George. Thought you didn't chew gum?,I don't.
12038,Fine. Fine. Excuse me. Think I'm gonna forget about this? I haven't forgotten about this. I don't forget that easily!,"Hey, Jerry, look who's here."
12039,"Yeah, let's all enjoy a chew, huh?","Uh, alright."
12040,"Now see, this is what the holidays are all about. Three buddies, sitting around, chewing gum, huh? Mmm, mmm, yeah. So uh, you know, Lloyd, he thinks he can get more of this.","Well, Lloyd's a very industrious fellow. I'm sure he can accomplish anything he sets his mind to."
12041,"No, sure sure, he wants to. It's very kind of you. Yeah, Jerry, he appreciates it. Don't you, Jerry?","Yes I do, Kramer."
12042,Yeah?,"How about that Elaine today, huh?"
12043,"How about that Elaine today, huh?","Oh, baby, what was that all about, huh?"
12044,"Oh, baby, what was that all about, huh?",She was practically undressing in front of me at the theatre.
12045,Warning signs?,"Nervousness, irritability, paranoia."
12046,"What?  Wh... what're you talking about? I'm not the one with the problem. Lloyd Braun was in the nuthouse, not me.","Yet again, taking pleasure in the misfortunes of others."
12047,"I'm... I'm concerned. George? George, are you listening to me?",You see that woman on the horse?
12048,You see that woman on the horse?,"She stole twenty dollars from me. Yeah, I might've gotten it back, but Lloyd Braun interfered!"
12049,So you say she was on a horse?,"I'm telling you, that cashier is riding horses on my money."
12050,What?,"I was chewing gum with Lloyd Braun, and he was bragging about the peepshow you gave him at the Alex."
12051,"Well, let's look in lost and found, shall we?",They're half-glasses.
12052,Brown?,"Mmm, yes, yes."
12053,"Uh, yeah. Ah, we'll if they're not in the box, I'm sure they'll turn up soon. Listen, could you keep an eye on the place? I wanna go out and get some paraffin wax, and bring out the lustre of this vintage countertop.",Certainly.
12054,Hey! What is your problem?,"Oh, hello, it's you!  Listen lady, I got six minutes left on that meter, and I'm not budging til you admit you stole my twenty dollars. Huh-hu-hur, you're not so tough when you're not on your horse, are you Ruthie?"
12055,"Oh, hello, it's you!  Listen lady, I got six minutes left on that meter, and I'm not budging til you admit you stole my twenty dollars. Huh-hu-hur, you're not so tough when you're not on your horse, are you Ruthie?",Your car's on fire.
12056,Your hose! Where's your hose?!,Cop made me disconnect it.
12057,"Jeez! What happened to your car, buddy?",The Jon Voight car is no more.
12058,No kidding?,No kidding.
12059,"Alright, I'm here. Where's Braun?","What, he's not here yet?"
12060,"What, he's not here yet?","Look, I'll go downtown to Chinatown with him, but that is it!"
12061,Why?,They're Geoffrey Haarwood's.
12062,Hey gum-buddy. Nice frames. You ready to go?,"Yeah, yeah."
12063,Anybody see Elaine today?,"Oh yeah, she called a little earlier. She's coming over to check out lost and found."
12064,Are you outta your mind?,Wh...wh...wh... what's the problem here?
12065,Wh...wh...wh... what's the problem here?,This hotdog's been here since the silent era. You'd have to be insane to eat it.
12066,"Mmm, doesn't that smell good, huh?","Yeah, here we go, yeah. Mmm, oh. That's delicious. Mmm. It's a perfectly sane food to eat."
12067,"Excuse me. 'scuse me, weren't you told to stop using that hose?",How would you happen to know that?
12068,How would you happen to know that?,"Well, uhm... I..."
12069,"You're that lady that was talking to the cops, aren't you?",Uh... I...
12070,Lloyd?,Lloyd?
12071,Lloyd?,What is Lloyd's problem?
12072,What is Lloyd's problem?,"Look, honey, I know you're trying to get Lloyd to notice you, but this is too much. Parading around in a wet T-shirt."
12073,"So, you want my father to pay for this?",You saw him. He was fiddling with the engine. God knows what he did there.
12074,What cashier?,You remember the woman on the horse? She wanted my spot.
12075,You remember the woman on the horse? She wanted my spot.,To park her horse?
12076,To park her horse?,"No, she wasn't on the horse."
12077,"So, your car caught fire because of my father and the woman on the horse?",That's right.
12078,The man with the flowers?,"Yeah, yeah, the flower guy. Listen, I know this all sounds a little crazy, but..."
12079,Who?,Jerry Seinfeld. My best friend. He can explain all of this. Jerry.
12080,"Jerry, where y'going? It's... what're...",That was your best friend?
12081,That was your best friend?,"Yeah, yeah, but he doesn't wear glasses."
12082,Got any money?,Here.
12083,Got all this?,Yeah. A hundred dollar's worth.
12084,I gave you a hundred dollars?!,"You sure did. Am I crazy, or is that a lotta gum?"
12085,"You sure did. Am I crazy, or is that a lotta gum?",It's a lotta gum!
12086,Is that from Henry the Eighth?,"Yes, yes, it is."
12087,"Well, you know, we're screening that tonight at the Alex. Do you think that I could wear that to promote the theatre?","Well, I... I'd love to lend it to you, but I doubt if it would fit a man of your impressive, Raymond Massey-like, physique. The only person who could really fit into this costume, would have to be a short, stocky, man of somewhat generous proportions."
12088,"Can I get a pack of gum, please?","I beg your pardon, your majesty, but we don't accept bills with lipstick on the president."
12089,"What? Huh, so I had it all along. How d'you like that?  I guess I owe that cashier an apology.",Oh my God!
12090,"Well, thank you. Uh, where is your friend King Henry?","Oh, he ran away."
12091,"I, I think that's my button. You know, I've been looking all over for it. Did, did you find it here?","Yes, it was in the lost and found."
12092,Shall I undo it?,"Oh yes, of course you can."
12093,So I take it he's spongeworthy?,"Oh, yeah."
12094,"Oh, no?","Yeah. In fact, he...."
12095,"Yes, it is. It is surprising. Does that bother you?","No. No, it doesn't bother me. I mean, it would be nice. I'm not gonna lie to you and say it wouldn't be nice."
12096,Sure. Why not? You're there.,Exactly.
12097,What stuff?,"I just came from the price club. I'm loaded up, baby."
12098,"All right. What are you, outta your mind? Look at this. What did you buy here? You will never be able to finish all this stuff.",Course I will. These are staples.
12099,A four-pound can of black olives? That's a staple?,"Lindsay olives, Jerry."
12100,A forty-eight pack of Eggo waffles? A gallon of barbecue sauce? Ten pounds of cocktail meatballs?,$17.50. You can't beat that.
12101,"Hey, Kramer! What's happening, dude?","Yeah. Ahh. Hey, this is Jerry here."
12102,How ya doin'?,Hi.
12103,John Germaine? That is amazing. I was just talking about him upstairs with Elaine.,Oh yeah?
12104,Oh yeah?,"Oh, yeah. My friend Elaine and him are goin' out. They're pretty hot and heavy."
12105,Is that right?,"Hey, how 'bout giving me a hand? You know, bring some of this stuff upstairs."
12106,"Hey, how 'bout giving me a hand? You know, bring some of this stuff upstairs.","Oh, sorry Kramer, I got to watch the hands. My hands are my life."
12107,"Georgie, can you zip me up?","Yeah. Yeah, one second."
12108,"So, what do you think? Your old man can look pretty good when he wants to, huh?",I don't like that tie.
12109,What's the matter with this tie? I've hardly worn it.,It's too thin. They're wearing wide now.
12110,How do you know what kind of ties they wear?,Go to any office building on 7th Avenue and tell me if there's anyone there wearing a thin tie like that. Go ahead!
12111,"George, do you think he should wear a tie like that?",Huh?
12112,Huh?,I think he should wear whatever tie he wants.
12113,It's out of our way. Why can't we pick up something at Lord's? It's right over here.,No! We have to go to Schnitzer's! I'll show these people something about taste!
12114,So what did he have to say?,Nothing. I told him you two we're pretty hot and heavy.
12115,Hot and heavy? You said hot and heavy?,Yeah.
12116,What did you do that for?,What?
12117,What?,What if he tells John? Then John's gonna think that I think that we're hot and heavy. I don't want John thinking that I'm hot and heavy if he's not hot and heavy.
12118,What if he tells John? Then John's gonna think that I think that we're hot and heavy. I don't want John thinking that I'm hot and heavy if he's not hot and heavy.,Oh
12119,How do you know that?,I should have helped Kramer with those packages.
12120,"Let me give you a hand. Hey, Kramer. I wonder, could you do me a favor? I'm taking the family to Disneyworld next week. I wonder...",Uh-huh.
12121,"I wonder, could you pick up my mail?",Yeah. Sure. Sure.
12122,"In fact, you know what, how would you like to take my hansom cab for the week?",Drive the horse?
12123,Drive the horse?,It'll just be sitting there. You can really clean up. 500 bucks a day. I'll split it with ya.
12124,What are you complimenting her for? She didn't make it Rowenna did.,What is this thing anyway?
12125,What is this thing anyway?,It's Cornish gamehen.
12126,"What is that, like a little chicken?","It's, uh, it's not a little chicken. Little chicken. It's a gamebird."
12127,Gamebird?,Yeah.
12128,"What do you mean? Like, you - you hunt it?",Yes.
12129,How hard could it be to kill this thing?,I couldn't help but notice that you have quite a library in there.
12130,More wine anyone?,Yeah. I'll take some.
12131,Hmmm?,Thank you.
12132,How do you like the Merlot?,Merlot? I never heard of it. Did they just invent it?
12133,Merlot? I never heard of it. Did they just invent it?,"Oh, mother."
12134,"Let me understand, you got the hen, the chicken and the rooster. The rooster goes with the chicken. So, who's having sex with the hen?",Why don't we talk about it another time.
12135,"But you see my point here? You only hear of a hen, a rooster and a chicken. Something's missing!",Something's missing all right.
12136,Did anybody see Firestorm?,"Firestorm, that's a he'll of a picture."
12137,And who doesn't serve cake after a meal? What kind of people? Would it kill them to put out a pound cake? Something!,"So, they didn't give you a piece of cake? Big deal."
12138,"So, they didn't give you a piece of cake? Big deal.",It is a big deal. You're supposed to serve cake after a meal. I'm sorry. It's impolite.
12139,What is this? The marble rye?,"Oh, dear. I forgot to put out that - that bread they brought."
12140,Where is it?,I don't know. Where'd you put it?
12141,I don't know. Where'd you put it?,Right over there.
12142,You stole the bread?,What do you mean stole? It's my bread. They didn't eat it. Why should I leave it there?
12143,What do you mean stole? It's my bread. They didn't eat it. Why should I leave it there?,Because we brought it for them!
12144,Is it possible they took it back?,Who would bring a bread and take it back?
12145,Who would bring a bread and take it back?,"Those people, that's who. I think they're sick."
12146,He stole back the rye?,Yeah.
12147,Why?,Why? Why? ''Cause he's off his rocker! That's why.
12148,Why? Why? ''Cause he's off his rocker! That's why.,"So, do the Ross's know?"
12149,"So, do the Ross's know?",I don't know. They're all very suspicious.
12150,Why wouldn't they be? A rye bread doesn't just disappear.,"Now, because of that stupid rye bread, I gotta keep them all separated for the rest of my life."

12368,You saw her? What was she wearing?,I don't know. I couldn't see. I couldn't look down because of my neck.
12369,Didn't you get a glimpse? An impression?,What d'you care?

12375,"Jerry, what is he talking about? He's being ridiculous.","Alright, look. Jerry, you know the whole story, you should settle this."
12376,"Yeah, I'd go for that. Would you go for that?","Alright, I'm down."
12377,"...But, you must promise That you will abide by my decision, no matter how unjust it may seem to either of you. Do I have your word?","Uh, yeah."
12378,Why can't we use Seven?,It's my name. I made it up. You can't just steal it.
12379,What happened to Soda?! I thought we all agreed on Soda.,"Well, we don't care for Soda."

12388,"Ahh. I can't go to the movies like this. Do you mind if we go back to my apartment, so I can change?","Change?  Yes, I think that's a super idea."
12389,"Change?  Yes, I think that's a super idea.",Are we almost there?
12390,Are we almost there?,"Just keep breathing, okay."
12391,"Well, you've both presented very convincing arguments. On the one hand, Elaine, your promise was given in haste. But was it not still a promise? Hmm?","And, Kramer, you did provide a service in exchange for compensation. But, does the fee, once paid, not entitle the buyer to some assurance Of reliability? Hmm? Huh? Ahh. These we're not easy questions to answer. Not for any man..."
12392,"And, Kramer, you did provide a service in exchange for compensation. But, does the fee, once paid, not entitle the buyer to some assurance Of reliability? Hmm? Huh? Ahh. These we're not easy questions to answer. Not for any man...","...But I have made a decision. We will cut the bike down the middle, and give half to each of you."
12393,What?! This is your solution?! To ruin the bike?!,"Alright, fine. Fine. Go ahead. Cut the stupid thing in half."
12394,What?!,"Sweet justice. Newman, you are wise."

12397,What're you doing? I thought you we're changing.,"No, I, I'm thinking we should just call it a night."
12398,You wanna throw something on and walk me to a cab?,Get out.
12399,"Hello, Christie? I was wondering if we could get together again?  Oh really? We'll you can't break up with me over the phone. C'mon, you gotta do this in person.

Hello.","Hey, Jerry, if you're gonna be snacking on these, you can't expect me to pay for the whole box."
12400,"Oh no. No no no no. I bought it from Kramer. He was hard up for cash. Fifty bucks!  Can you believe it? Of course, I had to make some minor modifications, you know.

12588,So what does he do?,He's an importer-exporter.
12589,What kind of problems are they having?,"Well, he uh, he wants to uh, quit the exporting and uh, focus just on the importing. And it's a problem, because she thinks the exporting is as important as the importing."
12590,Are you having an affair with Elaine?,"Right. C'mon! I'm having an affair with Elaine?! If I was having an affair with Elaine, I wouldn't tell you I'm going to see Elaine. I would make up some other person to tell you I was gonna go see, and then I would go see Ela..Elaine."
12591,"Right. C'mon! I'm having an affair with Elaine?! If I was having an affair with Elaine, I wouldn't tell you I'm going to see Elaine. I would make up some other person to tell you I was gonna go see, and then I would go see Ela..Elaine.",Huh?

12597,"Can't we eat at a decent hour? I'll treat, okay?",You're not buying us dinner.
12598,"...So, anyway, if you think about it, manure is not really that bad a word. I mean, it's 'newer', which is good, and a 'ma' in front of it, which is also good. Ma-newer , right?",You're so right. I never thought of it like that. Manure. 'Ma' and the 'newer'.
12599,Did you just make that up?,"What, you think I'm doing material here?"
12600,"What, you think I'm doing material here?","No, no. It's hard to believe anyone could be so spontaneously funny."
12601,"So, tell me, how is it that a man like you, so bald, and so quirky and funny, how is it you're not taken?","Well, Marisa. See, the thing is... I'm sort of engaged."

12610,Art Vandelay?,"Yeah, Art Vandelay."
12611,"Oh, just forget that we ever talked. Okay?",It is so forgotten.
12612,"So, was George helpful at all?","Yeah. Oh, yes, yes, he was very helpful. Uhm, because, you know, Art and I we're getting into this whole thing about his business. Uhm, you know he's an importer-exporter."

There, I said it, I'm sorry, I'm sorry. I see now how we made you feel when we made you sit home waiting. I dunno why we do it. I guess maybe we just kind of enjoy taking advantage of people. Well, that's gonna change. From now on, no more 'nine to twelve', no more 'one to five'. We're gonna have appointments. Eleven o'clock is gonna mean eleven o'clock. And, if we can't make it, we're gonna call you, tell you why. For god's sakes, if a doctor can do it, why can't we?  Anyway, that's it.","The bags are in the car, I guess we better go."

12636,Low flow? We'll I don't like the sound of that.,So what are your parents doing here in new York?
12637,So what are your parents doing here in new York?,"Well, they we're humiliated. I mean after the impeachment, my father left office in disgrace."
12638,So what are their plans?,"Well, this is the problem. They're moving into this new development. Here's the pamphlet. Del Boca Vista. But they're not quite ready to go back so they're in seclusion here for a while at Uncle Leo's."
12639,You mean the three of them in that tiny apartment?,"No, Leo's not there. He's got a girlfriend, Lydia. In fact, he moved in with her."
12640,Uncle Leo's having regular sex?,"Yeah, I know. It devalues the whole thing."

12642,How long they been doing this?,30 years.

12645,"Yeah, that is odd, isn't it?","Yeah, it is."

12648,"I don't know, maybe get an ice tray?",I can do that.
12649,"All right, bye. You see this? Any thought pops into their head they're calling me because it's a local call now.",Ahh.
12650,They have no idea when they're going back to Florida?,The only way out of this is if Leo breaks up with his girlfriend and has to move back into the apartment and then they would have to go back to Florida.
12651,How's that gonna happen?,It's about time you called your uncle. We've got to do this once a week.
12652,Once a week?  So how's Lydia?,"Ah, she's a real tiger."
12653,What?,"A man like you, limiting yourself to one woman, I don't know. But it's none of my business."
12654,What are you talking about?,We'll...
12655,"All right. Anyway, the point I was making before Goerbbles made your hamburger is a man like you could be dating women twenty years younger. C'mon Uncle Leo, I've seen the way women look at you. When's the last time you looked in a mirror? You're an Adonis! You've got beautiful features, lovely skin, you're in the prime of your life here, you should be swinging. If I we're you I'd tell this Lydia character, `It's been real,`move back into that bachelor pad and put out a sign; Open for business.","Believe me, I thought about it. But she is so perfect in every way, I can't see a flaw."
12656,What? Why not?,"I'm afraid it's your urine, Elaine. You tested positive for opium."
12657,Opium?,"That's right, Elaine. White lotus. Yam-yam. Shanghai Sally."
12658,"Obviously, Mr. Peterman, there's something wrong with this test. I don't take opium. Let me take another one, please? I'll call the doctor right now, I'll take a pop urine test.","All right, Elaine."
12659,"Whew! Boy, it's cold outside, huh? Oh, these New York winters, huh. Bitter cold, bitter.","I was out for five minutes before, I couldn't feel my extremities."
12660,What extremities?,"You know what the temperature in Florida is today? Eh? Seventy-nine. That's almost eighty. Yeah, I read someplace the life expectancy in Florida is eighty-one and in Queens, seventy-three."
12661,"You know what the temperature in Florida is today? Eh? Seventy-nine. That's almost eighty. Yeah, I read someplace the life expectancy in Florida is eighty-one and in Queens, seventy-three.","So George, why are you here?"
12662,"So George, why are you here?","What, I can't stop by and visit my parents?"
12663,"What, I can't stop by and visit my parents?",What's this.
12664,"That's where the Seinfeld's are moving. They got a great deal. Yep. You know what they got in Florida? Jai-Alai! You bet on the games, you clean up.",I don't bet.
12665,What about the dolphins? You could swim with the dolphins down there.,I don't swim.
12666,Are you trying to get rid of us?,"Rid? Nah, c'mon, the word is 'care'. Care. I care about your comfort, be it here in Queens or twelve-hundred miles away."

12668,No?,Jerry? Jerry!
12669,Jerry? Jerry!,"Wha, you too?"

12671,You? What about me? I got the Tonight Show tonight. I'm gonna have to shower in the dressing room.,Aw.
12672,Where are you going?,I gotta find another shower.
12673,They got you too?,This stuff is awful! I'm not Newman!
12674,What's wrong with your shower?,There's no water pressure.
12675,Why don't you just go see Jerry?,"Jerry's got nothing. Newman's got nothing. You're the only one I know who's got the good stuff, and I need it bad, baby, 'cause I feel like I got bugs crawling up my skin. Now you gotta help me out."
12676,Mr Peterman! What are you doing?,"Elaine, you're out of control. You need help."
12677,Huh?,"I know what you're going through. I too once fell under the spell of opium. It was 1979. I was travelling the Yangtzee in search of a Mongolian horsehair vest. I had got to the market after sundown, all of the clothing traders had gone, but a different sort of trader still lurked about. `Just a taste,`he said. That was all it took."
12678,"Oh, Elaine. The toll road of denial is a long and dangerous one. The price? Your soul. Oh, and by the way, you have til' 500 to clear out your desk. You're fired.",All they serve is chicken?
12679,All they serve is chicken?,There's more food down the hall.
12680,This is your dressing room? They treat you like Toscanini.,"Oh, Jerry. I don't know how you could do this. I'm so nervous for you."
12681,"Hey, hey, how was Florida?","Well, we just bought a new place down there."
12682,What?,"Why, you thinking of moving?"
12683,"Why, you thinking of moving?",Not really.
12684,Are you telling me there's not one condo available in all of Del Boca Vista?,That's right. They went like hotcakes.
12685,How'd you get yours?,Got lucky.
12686,Are you trying to keep us out of Del Boca Vista?!,"I know this doesn't seem like work to any of you, if you could perhaps conduct your psychopath convention down the hall, I could just get a little personal space."
12687,"How could I have tested positive twice? Once I could understand, that's a mistake. But twice?","Yeah, it's hard to figure."
12688,"Ah, the bush-men?",And the bush-women.
12689,"Welcome back. Talking with Jerry Seinfeld. Jerry, lemme ask you, I saw some people back there, they look like.. family? Is that family?","Yeah, I got some family backstage. Course my family's nuts; they're crazy. Yep. My uncle Leo,  I had lunch with him the other day, he's one of these guys that anything goes wrong in life, he blames it on anti-Semitism. You know what I mean, the spaghetti's not al dente? Cook's an anti-Semite. Loses a bet on a horse. Secretariat? Anti-Semitic. Doesn't get a good seat at the temple. Rabbi? Anti-Semite."

12694,"I just took a bath, Jerry. A bath?",No good?
12695,No good?,It's disgusting. I'm sitting there in a tepid pool of my own filth. All kinds of microscopic parasites and organisms having sex all around me.
12696,"Well, you used to sit in that hot tub?","Jerry, that was superheated water, nothing could live in that."
12697,Chicken?,"Oh, yeah."
12698,"Well, that makes sense. Want some chicken?","Yeah. Thanks. So, I'm gonna get tested again later, hopefully I'll get my job back and I will be on my way to Africa."
12699,"Hello Jerry. Well, I may have a solution to our little problem. Elaine, would you excuse us?","Oh c'mon, Newman."
12700,I have a private matter to discuss with my fellow tenants. If you don't mind?,Jerry?
12701,Jerry?,"Look, sister, go get yourself a cup of coffee, all right? Beat it!  All right, now here's the lowdown. From a certain connection, I've been able to locate some black market shower heads. They're all made in the former Yugoslavia, and from what I hear the Serbs are fanatic about their showers."

They're all made in the former Yugoslavia, and from what I hear the Serbs are fanatic about their showers.",Not from the footage I've seen.
12703,"Nevertheless, sometime this afternoon, behind the Market Diner, an unmarked van will be waiting. I'm expecting the call at any time. Are you in?",I'm down.
12704,Jerry?,"So, Georgie, we have some big news for you."

12708,"That's right, who the he'll are they? How dare they?!","So, Georgie, are you gonna come to visit us?"
12709,"So, Georgie, are you gonna come to visit us?","Oh, every chance I get."

12723,"Listen, is it all right if we move in with you for a little while? Sounds of breaking glass, Jerry dropped his bottle.",What was that?
12724,What was that?,"Nothing. A bottle broke. That's all. What do you mean, you're gonna move in here?"
12725,"Nothing. A bottle broke. That's all. What do you mean, you're gonna move in here?",Because the Costanzas are moving into Del Boca Vista.
12726,What?,They're not going back to Florida. They're moving here.
12727,What? Why?,Because your parents are going down there. My buffer zone just went from twelve hundred miles down to two feet! You gotta do something.

12729,Move back with Lydia?,"C'mon, you're lucky to have anybody."
12730,"Swinging? What are you, out of your mind? Look at you, you're disgusting. You're bald, you're paunchy, all kinds of sounds are emanating from your body twenty-four hours a day. If there's a woman that can take your presence for more than ten consecutive seconds, you should hang on to her like grim death. Which is not far off, by the way.",But she's an anti-Semite.
12731,Can you blame her?,"You don't think he minds us staying here, do you?"
12732,"You don't think he minds us staying here, do you?",Why would he mind? We're his parents.
12733,Why would he mind? We're his parents.,Oh.
12734,Hello. Jerry's not here?,No.
12735,What?,"A poppy seed! It must have been in the chicken. Oh, I'm dead. I'm going to the doctor's in a half an hour."

12738,What am I gonna do in the bathroom?,You gotta do me a favor.
12739,You want my urine?,I need a clean urine sample from a woman.

12749,Who is it?,It's the super. We're installing new low-flow showerheads in all the bathrooms.
12750,Low flow? I don't like the sound of that.,"So as a result of your test being free of opium, I am reinstating you."
12751,Oh! Yes! What a load off. So when are we going to Africa?,I'm afraid I can't take you.
12752,What? Why not?,"Elaine, according to your urine analysis, you're menopausal. you have the metabolism of a sixty-eight year old woman."
12753,What does he want with your swim trunks?,Why should they go to waste?!?
12754,Why should they go to waste?!?,Thank you! Goodnight!
12755,"Right.. Oh, I'm sorry. Uh, oh, so you saw the show?",Saw it? I loved it! And thank you for the free tickets. You are so funny.
12756,Saw it? I loved it! And thank you for the free tickets. You are so funny.,"Oh, thanks."
12757,"Ohh.. that's too bad.. Susan thought we'd really get along - I guess because we're both wacko!  You know what, um.. You have to give this to them for me. Okay? Here. It's a wedding present.",Oh?
12758,Oh?,"And Jerry? Be careful with it, okay? Be very careful."
12759,"And Jerry? Be careful with it, okay? Be very careful.",Uh-huh.
12760,"So, I was wondering, would it be okay if I turned your room into a billiard parlor?",A billiard parlor?
12761,A billiard parlor?,"Regulation table, the hi-fi, maybe even a bar.. Give it real authenticity.."
12762,"Okay.. So.. Frank, did George ever show you that photo?",What photo?
12763,What photo?,"You know, the photo I took in Tuscany of the little man in front of the sign that said `Costanza`?"
12764,"You know, the photo I took in Tuscany of the little man in front of the sign that said `Costanza`?",There's a Costanza in Tuscany?  Did he look like me? Did you talk to him?
12765,There's a Costanza in Tuscany?  Did he look like me? Did you talk to him?,"I didn't talk to anyone - I was just walking by, and I saw the sign, and I thought George might get a kick out of it."
12766,Who is that?,"When the Costanzas came here, one brother stayed behind."
12767,"So, you weren't born here?","No. That's why I can never be president.. It always irked me. That's why, even at an early age, I had no interest in politics. I refuse to vote. They don't want me, I don't want them!"
12768,Don't bring me down. Do you have another copy of that photo?,"No, I, I don't. But.. Well, the Maestro might."
12769,The Maestro? What Maestro?,"He's this guy that I went to Tuscany with. He's a great guy, but I just wouldn't feel comfortable calling him."
12770,Really? Why?,Because he hasn't called me since we got back.. I spilled wine on his 8 by 10 photo of one of his favorite Italian opera stars.
12771,Who?,You know the Three Tenors?
12772,You know the Three Tenors?,Yeah.. Poverotti.. Domingo.. and.. uh.. the other guy.
12773,Could I take that box for you?,"Uh.. we'll, you better not. I'm supposed to be careful with it."
12774,What?,I bought a bottle of BBQ sauce in Memphis. I think the stewardess broke it when she tried to jam it into the overhead compartment because of this
12775,"Well, why don't you do your material?",I'm out.
12776,Nobody hit anything off. She just gave me the box. What the he'll are you doing?,I'm salvaging the sauce. What's the matter with you?
12777,I'm salvaging the sauce. What's the matter with you?,"Hey, hey, hey. Come on, come on."
12778,"Jerry, why don't you do a bit on Styrofoam?",Like what?
12779,Like what?,"Well, uh.. `What is this stuff? Why do we need this stuff?.. And why do they make it so small..?`"
12780,"Well, uh.. `What is this stuff? Why do we need this stuff?.. And why do they make it so small..?`",Where's the punchline?
12781,Where's the punchline?,It's all attitude..
12782,A door mat? That's what she had me lug up from Memphis?!,"Pretty chintzy, huh? Considering the money she makes.. She's a big executive for Federal Express."

13568,"Well, one question does come to mind. Have you considered just...asking them what happened to the briefcase?","They would never tell me, Elaine. First of all, they probably think that I killed Susan. Besides, I don't even think they like me."

13583,What was that?,"Well, Kevin, maybe I have a little doubt. I mean, nothing is a hundred percent."
13584,What?,"Oh, I get all jazzed up about something and I go way to far with it."

13938,"Alright, what happened, Frank? What is it that you can't get over?","Inchon, Korea, 1950. I was the best cook Uncle Sam ever saw, slinging hash for the Fighting 103rd. As we marched north, our supply lines we're getting thin. One day a couple of GIs found a crate, inside we're six hundred pounds of prime Texas steer. At least it once was prime. The Use date was three weeks past, but I was arrogant, I was brash, I thought if I used just the right spices, cooked it long enough..."
13939,What happened?,"I went too far. I over seasoned it. Men we're keeling over all around me. I can still hear the retching, the screaming. I sent sixteen of my own men to the latrines that night. They we're just boys."
13940,So you saw Bania's act?,He got two minutes into that Ovaltine thing and I just couldn't take it anymore.
13941,Why is he so obsessed with Ovaltine?,He just thinks that anything that dissolves in milk is funny.
13942,No more mentor?,Looks that way.
13943,Why?,We'll I'm feeling a little disoriented. It's just weird for me not to have an advisor.
13944,George?,I gotta run anyway.
13945,What did you say?,"Your meatloaf is mushy, your salmon croquettes are oily and your eggplant parmesan is a disgrace to this house!"
13946,And you're sure with your busy schedule you'd have time to take on a protg?,"I'll make time, because Abby, I was once like you; wide-eyed, naive, I didn't know the first thing about a subject as fundamental as risk management."
13947,Didja hear what happened? The mentor saw my act. She dumped me.,"Oh, that's too bad."
13948,You think you can give me a hand with my material?,Hey.
13949,You still need a cook?,"Oh yeah, come on in, Frank."
13950,Ya got T-Fal?,Keflon.
13951,"Why do they call it Ovaltine? The mug is round. The jar is round. They should call it round tine. That's gold, Jerry! Gold!",Let's just replace `hail of shrapnel`and `scar tissue`with `string of pearls`and `raspberry scones`.
13952,George Costanza is your mentor?,"Yeah, he's great! I am learning so much."
13953,About what? How to calculate five percent of a restaurant check?,You know what your problem is? You just have no respect for the mentor/mentor relationship.
13954,You know what your problem is? You just have no respect for the mentor/mentor relationship.,"As a matter of fact, I happen to have a protg of my own."
13955,Who?,A Mister Kenneth Bania.
13956,Bania?,I'm gonna mentor this kid to the top.
13957,"Hey Ed, let me ask you something. What's with the fatigues and all the psychotic imagery? Huh?",I don't want to talk about it.
13958,That's it?,"We'll it's tough meeting somebody you like, let alone somebody Jewish."
13959,Have you tried the hamentashen?,I can't get off the kishkas.
13960,Bania?,I just stopped by to thank you. That risk management stuff you wrote for me? It's killer!
13961,I just stopped by to thank you. That risk management stuff you wrote for me? It's killer!,Risk management?
13962,Risk management?,"Aw, it's gold, Jerry! Gold! I got all these corporate gigs and even Cynthia took me back."
13963,So you went from the mailroom to the director of corporate development in two days?,That's right.
13964,How much are they paying you? I'll double it.,Ya know these latkes are going like hotcakes.
13965,Where's the powdered sugar?,"You know Frank, you could take a break."
13966,You're quitting?,I can't churn out that pointless drivel any more.
13967,Ovaltine. Have you ever had this stuff? Why is it called Ovaltine?,They should call it round tine. You know what I'm talking about.
13968,"Hey, have you seen all these new commercials for indigestion drugs? Pepcid AC, Tagemat HB.","Ugh, the whole country's sick to their stomach."
13969,"Now, you know you're supposed to take these things before you get sick?","What is this, a 'bit'?"
13970,"What is this, a 'bit'?",No.
13971,"We're just talking. Is this not the greatest marketing ploy ever? If you feel good, you're supposed to take one!","Yeah, I know that tone. This is a bit."
13972,"Alright, are you done with your little amusement?",Then you admit it was amusing?
13973,Then you admit it was amusing?,"It was okay, but move the 'medication for the we'll' to the front, and hit the word 'good' harder."
13974,"So, your firm designed all the furniture in here?",We manufacture it. The original designs are by Karl Farbman.
13975,You know Farbman?,"Mm, love Farbman."
13976,Wouldn't it be great if Farbman designed shoes?,Brett? Don't you think that would be great?
13977,Brett? Don't you think that would be great?,Brett?
13978,Brett?,"After the song, babe."
13979,Huh?,The song.
13980,So when do I meet this jerk?,"He's not a jerk, Jer. He only works with Karl Farbman."
13981,Who?,"I dunno, some designer. Anyway, Brett is so generous, and sensitive. Last night he was moved just listening to a song."
13982,What song?,Desperado.
13983,Desperado?,Uh huh.
13984,And you're still dating him? I tell you who sounds a little desperado.,"See that salesman, twirling that umbrella."
13985,"That, had to be invented?","When I started out as a comedian, I sold umbrellas. It was my idea to twirl it, to attract customers."
13986,"Oh hoh, really? Well, why don't we ask him about it?",Elaine.
13987,"Alright, can we  go?","By the way, you're doing it too fast. You'll disorient the customers."
13988,I find it disorienting. Who buys an umbrella anyway? Y..you get 'em for free in the coffee shop in the metal cans.,Those belong to people.
13989,What checks?,"Oh, you didn't hear? Jerry's a big star in Japan."
13990,"Oh, you didn't hear? Jerry's a big star in Japan.",I don't know why. There's a one-second clip of me in the opening credits of some Japanese comedy show.
13991,"Hey, Jerry, you need any new furniture?",Why?
13992,Why?,"Yeah, we'll, Elaine's new boyfriend, you know. He's giving me this oversize chest of drawers. It's a Farbman."
13993,He's giving you furniture? Who is this guy?,"Ah, who are any of her losers?"
13994,"Ah, who are any of her losers?",You're on that list.
13995,"Oh, no, no, no. Not the Sunshine Carpet Cleaners?","Yeah, you heard of 'em?"
13996,"Yeah, you heard of 'em?",They're a crazy religious cult. The carpet cleaning is just a means for them to get into your apartment.
13997,"So? For a twenty-five dollar cleaning, I can listen to some pointless blather.","I do it, I'm not even getting the cleaning."
13998,Excuse me. Would you take picture please?,"Oh, yeah, sure."
13999,"Hey. Nice twirl you got there. You know who invented that, don't you?","Hey, are you folks from Japan."
14000,You recognise that mug?,That's the funny face that greets you at the beginning of the Super Terrific Happy Hour.
14001,What is he doing?,"Well, I don't know. But something super terrific, I'm sure."
14002,"Sorry. You're sure, uh, there isn't anything else?",No.
14003,"So, that's it?",Unless you need a receipt.
14004,What's with the claw?,Super terrific carpal tunnel syndrome.
14005,Have you seen the chest of drawers that Brett gave to Kramer?,The Fleckman.
14006,"Oh. Jerry, you wanna join us?","Oh, where you going? The coffee shop?"
14007,"Oh, where you going? The coffee shop?",Coffee shop? I think we can do a little better than that. You look like you could use a solid meal at a real restaurant.
14008,Coffee shop? I think we can do a little better than that. You look like you could use a solid meal at a real restaurant.,You look like you could use a...
14009,"Three hundred dollars. Hey, Mr Oh, how much would these run you in Tokyo?","Ahh, about, uh, thirty thousand yen."
14010,Thirty thousand?! These are practically free.,Giddyup. You're a cowboy now.
14011,"I feel terrible about your friend Jerry. He's upset that I gave Kramer that chest of drawers, isn't he?",Why? Why d'you think he's upset?
14012,Why? Why d'you think he's upset?,"How could he not be? Living in that cramped little apartment. And outdated furniture, so terribly... un-Karl Farbman-like."
14013,"How could he not be? Living in that cramped little apartment. And outdated furniture, so terribly... un-Karl Farbman-like.","We're not gonna talk about Karl Farbman all night, are we?"
14014,"We're not gonna talk about Karl Farbman all night, are we?",I hope not.
14015,Brett? Everything alright?,Brett! What is it? Is there someone outside?
14016,Brett! What is it? Is there someone outside?,"Elaine, the song."
14017,"Elaine, could you just not talk for one minute?",Sorry.
14018,No spiel?,Not a peep. They just cleaned the carpets and left. Call themselves a cult!
14019,So you're angry that this bizarre carpet cabal made no attempt to abduct you?,They could've at least tried!
14020,"You know, maybe they thought you looked too smart to be brainwashed?",Please.
14021,Too dumb?,We'll! Mack is back in town! Nice duds.
14022,"Well, Jerry, they're Japanese. I mean, that TV you watch, that sushi you eat, I mean, even that kimono you wear. Where to you think all that money goes, hmm?",That's right.
14023,How'd you hook up with these guys?,"Well, they recognised Jerry from the Super Terrific Happy Hour. See now, you should be doing your own show in Japan. Now, they get you."
14024,What kind of show am I gonna do in Japan?,"Alright, what'd you do with that pilot you did."
14025,You had a date? You went out with my butler?! Who said you could go out with my butler?!,"Well, why do I need your permission?"
14026,"Well, why do I need your permission?",Because he's my butler.
14027,So? What d'you think?,We're bit confused. Why was this man Jerry's butler?
14028,We're bit confused. Why was this man Jerry's butler?,"Ah. You see, the man who was the butler, uh, had gotten into a car accident with Jerry, and because he didn't have any insurance, the judge decreed that the man become Jerry's butler."
14029,Is this customary in your legal system?,No. That's what makes it such a humorous situation.
14030,SUBTITLE Are you following any of this?,SUBTITLE I'm still trying to figure out why they gave us a bag of oranges.
14031,What does he listen to? The all Desperado station?,"He is just in his own world when he hears that song. It's like, I'm sitting there in the car, and he's.. out riding fences."
14032,"Okay. So, is there any song that you feel very strongly about?",I like Witchy Woman.
14033,Witchy Woman?,"You know, Witchy Woman. 'Ooo-ooh, wit-chay woman'."
14034,Hey. How was the Rainbow Room?,"Uh, we'll, we, uh, we had to leave early. There was a, uh, slight monetary discrepancy regarding the bill."

14036,What for?,"Yeah, we'll, uh, my Japanese friends're gonna stay with me."
14037,I thought they all had suites at the Plaza?,"Well, I'm sorry, Jerry, we all don't have checks rolling in like you do."
14038,"Well, what about all that money from the kimonos I wear?","Well, they ran out of it. Manhattan can be quite pricey. Even with fifty thousand yen."
14039,Fifty thousand yen? Isn't that only a few hundred dollars?,"Evidently. Oh, by the way, tell Brett that his chest of drawers are a big hit. My guests are very comfortable in them."
14040,In them?!,You have them sleeping in drawers?!
14041,You have them sleeping in drawers?!,"Jerry, have you ever seen the business hotels in Tokyo? They sleep in tiny stacked cubicles all the time. They feel right at home."
14042,"Jerry, have you ever seen the business hotels in Tokyo? They sleep in tiny stacked cubicles all the time. They feel right at home.",This has 'international incident' written all over it.
14043,What is this?,"Rice Crispies. East meets West, Jerry."
14044,Shh-shh!  What d'you think?,What are you doing? That's Witchy Woman. That could be our song.
14045,What are you doing? That's Witchy Woman. That could be our song.,"Witchy Woman is okay for you, but I've already got a song."
14046,"Oh. Oh, then how about Desperado?  We can share it.",No. It's mine.
14047,"Bailed? C'mon, you knew I wanted to be a comedian. Besides, we had some good time. Remember Tropical Storm Renee?","Oh, yeah, sure. But where we're you during the poncho craze of eighty-four? I almost lost my house."
14048,"Oh, yeah, sure. But where we're you during the poncho craze of eighty-four? I almost lost my house.","Umbrella, buddy?"
14049,"Umbrella, buddy?",Now we got that damn 'urban sombrero' to contend with.
14050,"Aw, it was so many years ago. Who cares?",I care. Clicky cares.
14051,Could I just buy an umbrella?,"Yeah, sure. Two hundred dollars."
14052,What?!,"Special price, for a real foul-weather friend."
14053,"Hey, George. How about that tour, huh? These guys are ready to run the bases.","Kramer, it's, it's raining. They got the tarp on the field."
14054,"Ah, listen, George, what else can I do with these guys? Now, bear in mind, they're a little light on the yen.","Well, I, I got the pilot of the Jerry show."

14060,"What kind of a snobby, stuck-up, cult is this?!",Hey Jerry!
14061,Haven't you ever heard of an umbrella?,"Ah, I didn't have enough money."
14062,"Ah, don't worry, I can spot you the  twelve cents?","No, it's not the money. It's my hand. It's crippled from writing and writing."
14063,"Nothing's working for you, is is?","Not at the moment, Brett."
14064,Boogey?,"I'm quite sure. Anyway, any luck getting together on a song?"
14065,"I'm quite sure. Anyway, any luck getting together on a song?","No. He blew out my Witchy Woman, and he won't share Desperado. Hey, what d'you think of Oye Como Va?"
14066,"No. He blew out my Witchy Woman, and he won't share Desperado. Hey, what d'you think of Oye Como Va?",Eehh.
14067,Really? They bought the butler character?,Did I tell you that story's relatable?! That was a great show! That is why I'm bringing it back to NBC.

14222,You think?,"Yeah. I mean, let's say this is your brain. Okay, from what I know about you, your brain consists of two parts the intellect, represented here , and the part obsessed with sex. Now granted, you have extracted an astonishing amount from this little scrap. But with no-sex-Louise, this previously useless lump, is now functioning for the first time in it's existence."
14223,What is goin' on in there?,"I met some people smoking on the street, so I invited them up to my apartment to smoke."
14224,Why?,"We'll somebody had to. You know, just because a person's a smoker, that doesn't mean he's not a human being."

14248,Are you all right?,"I don't know. It's just the last coupla days my mind has been, not good."
14249,What? What are you talking about?,"To a woman, sex is like the garbage man. You just take for granted the fact that any time you put some trash out on the street, a guy in a jumpsuit's gonna come along and pick it up. But now, it's like a garbage strike. The bags are piling up in your head. The sidewalk is blocked. Nothing's getting through. You're stupid."
14250,What? What happened to your face? It looks like an old catcher's mitt.,"What?  My face is all craggly, it's crinkly."
14251,"What?  My face is all craggly, it's crinkly.",It's from all that smoke. You've experienced a lifetime of smoking in 72 hours. What did you expect?

14262,What for? Oh come on.,I just wanna clear my head. It has nothing to do with you.
14263,"Oh, all right. Is Kramer home?","You know, Louise. I think you'll find this amusing. In early Euclidean geometry--"
14264,Mas Caf?,"Si, por favor."
14265,Who could love me?,"I disagree. In fact, I feel Mr. Kramer projects a rugged masculinity."
14266,"Rugged? The man's a goblin. He's only been exposed to smoke for four days. By the time this case gets to trial, he'll be nothing more than a shrunken head.","All right, Mr. Chiles. You'll have our offer by tomorrow. Good day, gentlemen."
14267,What? you're breaking up with me? But I sacrificed and supported you while you struggled. What about my dream of dating a doctor?,"I'm sorry, Elaine. I always knew that after I became a doctor, I would dump whoever I was with and find someone better. That's the dream of becoming a doctor."

14279,"Yeah, but then, you know, some people we're telling me about that little flap out there at the junior high assembly. And before that, you we're bumped by a lizard?","Actually, it was a ********."
14280,"those things, deadly dangerous. A long time ago my uncle and a date are driving, like, through Mexico. They see one on the road, drags him out of the road, and chews his face off. Listen, we'll call you if anything opens up. Okay, Jimmy?",Jerry.
14281,Is it better than mine?,Oh yeah.
14282,"So, it's a two-bedroom-one-bath-make-your-friends-hate-ya?","You know what? it's better than Elaine's, too. I gotta give her a call."

14284,"Hey, you got any extra furniture down there? I need some more stuff to fill that extra bedroom with the walk-in closet.","Oh, this is really annoying."
14285,What is with that?!,"Well, it's coughing, Jerry. It expells the diseased germs out of the body, into the air."
14286,Where is your key?,"Yeah, we'll, uh, Newman. He's - he's got it."
14287,Mail bags? He's storing mail in here?,Evidently.
14288,"Excuse me, George?","Yeah, uh, no menus."

14302,"That's no tragedy! How many people do you lose on a normal cruse? 30? 40?! Kramer, can I take a look at that book?",Oh yeah. I also got `Astounding Bear Attacks`
14303,"Hey, uh, before you go, did you talk to Newman about getting that mail outta there?","Yeah, oh, yeah. Yeah, he's not gonna do it."
14304,Newman?,I guess.
14305,What are you talking about?,I didn't get my transfer.
14306,`Transfer`?,"To Hawaii. The most sought-after postal route of them all. The air is so dewy-sweet you don't even have to like the stamps.. But it's not to be - So, I'm hanging it up."

14316,Mmm.. Bad how?,"Well, you know when you break up, how you say things you don't mean? Well, he says the mean things you don't mean, but he means them."
14317,"Well, you know when you break up, how you say things you don't mean? Well, he says the mean things you don't mean, but he means them.",I follow. So what are you gonna do?
14318,I follow. So what are you gonna do?,"Dump him. I can't be with someone who doesn't break up nicely. I mean, to me, that's one of the most important parts of a relationship."
14319,What's more important?,Hey.
14320,What's with the dog?,"Yeah, this is Smuckers. I borrowed him."
14321,A vet?,"Oh, I'll take a vet over an M.D. any day. They gotta be able to cure a  lizard, a chicken, a pig, a frog  - all on the same day."

14333,That's it?!  That's the best you got?!,"So, he's keeping the apartment. He doesn't deserve it, though! Even if he did suffer, that was, like, 40 years ago! What has he been doing lately?! I've been suffering for the past 30 years up to and including yesterday!"
14334,"So, he's keeping the apartment. He doesn't deserve it, though! Even if he did suffer, that was, like, 40 years ago! What has he been doing lately?! I've been suffering for the past 30 years up to and including yesterday!","You know, if this tenant board is so impressed with suffering, maybe you should tell them the `Astonishing Tales of Costanza`."
14335,"I'm with people, I'll be with you in a moment. So, you want a protein shake, or something?","Nah, I guess I should really get moving on this, huh? I'm gonna go."
14336,"Nah, I guess I should really get moving on this, huh? I'm gonna go.",Hello.. Newman.

14360,Bit you?!,"We had an arguement about me going to Hawaii, and he locked onto my ankle like it was a soup bone. I'm hubbled! I don't think I can do my route - and they're awarding the transfer in two days!"
14361,"Well, what if I deliver it?",You?!  You can't deliver mail!
14362,You?!  You can't deliver mail!,"Well, why not?"
14363,"Well, why not?",I guess you're right. It's just walking around putting it into boxes..

14389,What happened?,"Well, first, I'm brushing my teeth and this piece of apple-skin, that must have been lodged in there for days, comes loose."
14390,You're still doing that?,"Sometimes, once in a while."
14391,What are you gonna do there?,"Nothing really, you know...just eh, stroll around the cell blocks, maybe eh, take in a shower fight. Hey eh, you know you got a bounced check hanging up in the little market over on Columbus?"

14447,Of what?,"Yah, yah! You see in Little Jerry Seinfeld the unlimited future you once had. Now, just because Jerry Seinfeld is a has-been, don't make Little Jerry Seinfeld a never-was!"
14448,Does she have any plans after she's released?,"Plans. Schemes. She ah, she keeps talking about getting back together with her old friends, you know - `the gang,`as she likes to call them , you know. Yeah, they're eh, they're hatching something, you can count on that."
14449,Jerry! Tomorrow night's fight-night. Where's my rooster?,Kramer won't sell.
14450,You want Little Jerry to take a dive?,"Shhh, not so loud."

14471,Why? Why did you get into a fist fight with the cop? You we're innocent!,"They thought I was George. I'm not that bald. And I have too little time left to take that kind of crap, so I, slugged him."

14526,You know that number?,"I used to have a problem. Well, what d'you mean, he's not registered? Wha..S, E, I, N, V..."
14527,"I used to have a problem. Well, what d'you mean, he's not registered? Wha..S, E, I, N, V...","F. F, E, L , D."

14534,Who was that?,"That was the Golden Nugget. Also in Atlantic City. They heard such good things about my show at Bally's, they want me for tonight. So I'll have to repack, and go."
14535,I'm worried. What happens if we have to support Jerry?,I'd have to go back to work.
14536,Where would you work?,Maybe I should talk to Elaine.
14537,What's not to understand?,"Well, for one thing, you live in Florida."

14544,I do?,"There was a man, he was trying to get into my apartment last night. He was jiggling the doorknob for twenty-five minutes."
14545,"No, no, no. It was a fearless cat burglar. Now listen, you gotta let me sleep here, huh? Y'know, I'll stay here on my side, and I'll stuff a sock in my mouth. 'Cos I don't wanna sleep alone.","Well, I do."

14560,"What d'you mean, let 'em go? They're spending all my money.","Alright, we'll, then they stay. Lemma ask you something..."
14561,"Could you put a little thought into this? Jerry's gone, you could humour me. He humours me.","Speaking of Jerry, his father is driving me so crazy down at Peterman's."

14566,Really?,Estelle's got the  jimmy arms.
14567,You can get that in your arms?,Like you wouldn't believe.
14568,"Jerry, it's getting late. You've cleaned up the car. You've made all your phone calls. Why are you still here?","Well, I uh, maxed out my credit cards, and I don't have enough cash for a hotel room. So..."

14579,When are we gonna tell Jerry?,I don't wanna worry him. We'll tell him next time we go up.

14581,How many times can you check the car?,I saw a bum sleeping in a Cadillac the other day.
14582,Why would someone break into a car to take a nap?,They don't nap. They make it their home. They urinate in there!
14583,"That's it, we're going back to Queens. Where's my hat?",Nooh!
14584,"Well, why don't we just put a monitor in his skybox?","Hey George, the ocean called. They're running outta shrimp."
14585,"'The ocean called, They're running outta shrimp'?","Yeah, yeah, yeah. But then, I said to him, 'Oh yeah? Well, the jerk store called, and they're running outta you.'"
14586,"Yeah, yeah, yeah. But then, I said to him, 'Oh yeah? Well, the jerk store called, and they're running outta you.'",Really? That's great. You said that to him?
14587,Really? That's great. You said that to him?,"Well, actually, I thought it up on the way over here."
14588,"...Ahh. You don't plan to hit these balls with that racquet, do you?","Checking out the staff picks, Miss Benes?"
14589,"Checking out the staff picks, Miss Benes?","Oh. Ha-ha. Hey. Yeah, yeah. This Vincent guy, he is the best. He and I have the exact same taste in movies."
14590,"Gene? Oh, it's so stupid and mainstream.","I've seen all these, so I went with a Kramer pick."
14591,"Jerry, have you ever seen the movie The Other Side Of Darkness?",No.
14592,"Can you do that for me, buddy?","Well, I don't if what you have here constitutes a legally binding document."
14593,"Oh, hey, new racquet, huh?","Yeah. I wasn't gonna get it, but this guy Milos, who runs the pro shop, he really recommended it."
14594,What?,Did you enjoy the movie?
14595,Did you enjoy the movie?,Who is it?
14596,Who is it?,It's Vincent.
14597,Of Vincent's picks?,The same.
14598,He called you?,"He musta got my number off the computer. We ended up talking for, like, two hours."
14599,To a guy you've never met?  Your screening process is getting ever more rigorous.,Trying to meet him. He's never at the video store. They said he sets his own hours.
14600,"Hey, how come we played at this crummy place instead of your club?",George used up all my guest passes already.
14601,Milos?,"Oh, hey. How you doing?"
14602,"Oh, hey. How you doing?","Okay, we should uh, wrap it up here."
14603,So he was bad. What d'you care?,"Elaine, I paid two hundred dollars for this racquet, because he said it's the only one he plays with. He could've played just as we'll with a log."
14604,The executor? Of what?,Kramer wants to die with dignity.
14605,D'you get someone to take that Canadian quarter?,"I got another meeting with Reilly. A whole new audience, and I bet I can get him to try that line again."
14606,Who's Reilly?,"George was scarfing shrimp at this meeting, and this guy says 'Hey, George, the ocean called. They're running outta shrimp.'"
14607,Listen to the comeback. 'Oh yeah? We'll the jerk store called. They're running outta you.',Wha...You gotta be kidding me?!
14608,Wha...You gotta be kidding me?!,"How 'bout this one? How 'bout, 'Your cranium called. It's got some space to rent.'?"
14609,"How 'bout this one? How 'bout, 'Your cranium called. It's got some space to rent.'?",What does that mean?
14610,What does that mean?,"Hey, here you go. 'Hey, Reilly. The zoo called. You're due back by six.'"
14611,"Alright, alright. You see? This is why I hate writing with a large group. Everybody has their own little opinions, and it all gets homogenised, and you lose the whole edge of it. I'm going with jerk store! Jerk store is the line! Jerk store! Yess!",Did you take this out of the garbage?
14612,Did you take this out of the garbage?,"Yeah, it's still got some spring in the strings."
14613,"Oh, Jerry, this is a piece of junk. How are you gonna be the executor of my living will?",You see? You can't let go.
14614,You see? You can't let go.,"Trust me, Kramer. Given the legal opportunity, I will kill you."
14615,"I wish I could believe you. Hey, Elaine, do you have some free time tomorrow afternoon?",Me?
14616,Me?,"Yeah, because you're perfect. You're a calculating, cold-hearted businesswoman. And when there's dirty work to be done, you don't mind stomping on a few throats."
14617,"Well, would I be able to communicate?",I don't see how.
14618,"Believe me, it is Milos great shame. But Jerry, I could lose my business if anybody find out. How would you like extra year membership of the club? Free. No charge.",You could do that?

14753,"You mean, like, a former member?","These Kramer stories are unusable!  I mean, some of them aren't even stories!  Look, this is a list of things in his apartment!"
14754,Is my toaster oven on there?,How am I ever gonna turn this into a book?
14755,How am I ever gonna turn this into a book?,"Well, just shape them - change them. You're a writer."
14756,What? Wheren't they just here?,Yeah. I'm flying them in to meet Ellen. I don't know where to turn! I gotta see what they think of her.

14758,"Oh, hey! Hey, have I told you about my bunions? Oh, you're gonna love this story!  So, I line up my cold cuts on the couch next to me, but as I'm stacking them up, they keep falling into my foot bath!","Kramer, this is awful! We don't want to hear about this!"
14759,What?,"Oh, I bought a bunch of bunion stories from Newman - but they all stink!"
14760,How much did you pay for them?,Eight bucks! I think I got ripped off!
14761,"Oh, what didn't you like about the first chapter?","Well, it started out nicely `I'm returning some pants.`A very identifiable problem.. `I set of down a train tunnel.`.. But that's where the story takes a most unappealing turn."
14762,"Oh, no, no! That's where it gets interesting! Don't you see? The - the train is bearing down on you, you - you dive into a side tunnel - and you run into a whole band of underground tunnel dwellers!","It just seems so cliched, and obvious. It's not interesting writing."
14763,"Yeah.. yeah. I know. Um.. how about if, instead of.. diving from the train, you.. uh, you, I don't know, you slip and, and fall in some mud, and.. ruin your pants?","The very pants I was returning. That's perfect irony! Elaine, that is interesting writing!"
14764,You want to know something? I no longer need them!,"No, no. Mister Peterman, why don't we keep them - as a, as a reference?"
14765,"No, no. Mister Peterman, why don't we keep them - as a, as a reference?","Nonsense!  I have Benes' woderfully imaginative mind to spin my stories. You take back your tales, you vagabond!"
14766,"So, Mister Costanza, did you get my scholarship back?","Now, fellas, fellas.. easy. You wouldn't want to beat up on one of your own."
14767,Is that right? Then why don't you flash us the sign?,Right.. the sign.
14768,"Sorbonne? Oh, hey. That's in Paris.","Oh, Jerry, you're parking meter's about to expire. Don't get up, I've got change."
14769,So? What do you think?,"Jerry, she's fantastic."
14770,"And so much personality! But, it doesn't matter what we think. Do you like her?","Now, I'm not so sure."
14771,How're your folks?,"Eh, they're trying to pick out a new couch - you don't want to know. Give me your wallet, or I'll spill your guts right here on the street!"
14772,What did you say?,"Come on, hurry up, old man! I'm an animal!"

15742,"What? All right, fine.",Are you mad at me?

15768,What is this?,"This is your lagging. Good work, Braun."
15769,Are you free Friday night?,"I am, but that is not the point. You are thirteen, and I am in my early... 20s."
15770,Who wants cookies?,"As of this moment, I am no longer Jewish. I quit!"
15771,What?,"Walnuts, mmmmmm."
15772,"You know what? It doesn't matter, because I quit!",I guess your mother was right. You never could compete with Lloyd Braun!
15773,"You wanna sell computers? I will show *you* how to sell computers! Hello, Mr. Farneman. You wanna buy a computer? No? Why not? All right, I see! Good answer! Thank you!

15798,What?,It means a non-Jewish woman.
15799,"I know what it means, but what does being a shiksa have to do with it?",You've got 'shiksappeal'. Jewish men love the idea of meeting a woman that's not like their mother.

15808,What?,Elaine...
15809,"Jerry, I've found a way to beat Lloyd Braun! I buy the computers myself, I store 'em in your apartment. Then, after I win the contest, I bring 'em all back and get my money back. Ha ha! It's brilliant. What? What's wrong with your leg?",I'm asking Elaine to marry me.
15810,Elaine?,"Uhh, Jerry, I've got a lot goin' on with, uh, Lippman right now."

15817,What do you think put me there?,I heard they found a family in your freezer

15819,"Come on, wanna give me a hand with the computers?",Serenity nooooowwwww!
15820,Why couldn't you squeeze one of those stupid rubber balls to get your stress out? Why did you have to destroy *twenty-five* computers?,"George, you listen to me. I owe ya one."
15821,He's incorrigible. You want to talk about it?,"Oh, please don't tell me you love me again, Jerry, I can't handle it."
15822,"George, letting my emotions out was the best thing I've ever done. Sure I'm not funny anymore, but there's more to life than making shallow, fairly-obvious observations. How about you?",All right... here goes...
15823,"Rabbi, is there anything I can do to combat this Shiks-appeal?","Ha! Elaine, shiks-appeal is a myth, like the Yeti, or his North American cousin, the Sasquatch."
15824,"Elaine, there's much you don't understand about the Jewish religion. For example, did you know that rabbis are allowed to date?","Well, what does that have to do...?"
15825,"Well, what does that have to do...?","You know, a member of my congregation has a timeshare in Myrtle Beach. Perhaps, if you're not too busy, we could wing on down after the High Holidays? Elaine? 'Lainie?"

15835,Really?,"Hey, Seinfelds!"
15836,How long are you staying?,We just came down for a funeral.
15837,Are you sure you don't need a hand with that?,"No no, the luggage is on the program. I got a brick in here."
15838,Did you give blood?,"No, not giving. hoarding. I'm storing it in to a blood bank. Just in case."
15839,In case of what?,"Jerry, I know myself. If I'm out on the street and it's starts to go down, I don't back off until it's finished."

15847,"I couldn't raise a kid? Come on, I love bossing people around.","What happened, I thought you we're with Tara tonight?"
15848,"What happened, I thought you we're with Tara tonight?","I was, I had to leave. She lit some vanilla incenses. The smell drove me nuts, all I could think about was food, I had to get out of there. We need some pudding here! Pudding!"
15849,You just left? What did you tell her?,I told I had a bus transfer that was only good just for another hour.
15850,What?,"I don't know, I was starving Jerry!"
15851,"Oh, pudding! You want some?","Hey, you guys think I'm getting a little...chunky?"
15852,"Hey, you guys think I'm getting a little...chunky?","What are you kidding? We look great! You know what this pudding needs? The skin on the top, you know like your mother used to make it on the stove."
15853,"What are you kidding? We look great! You know what this pudding needs? The skin on the top, you know like your mother used to make it on the stove.","Elaine, what do you think?"

15862,"She tolerated the strawberries and the chocolate sauce, but eh, it's not a meal, you know? Food and sex, those are my two passions. It's only natural to combine them.","Natural? Sex is about love between a man and a woman, not a man and a sandwich."

15873,You? I'm more responsible than you are!,"Don't be ridiculous. Now, if you'll excuse me, I have to go to fill my freezer with my own blood."
15874,Elaine? What are you doing here?,"Kramer is actually sleeping one off, so I thought that I'd help out... what's that, some raccoon or something..."
15875,"Well, I guess this would be all right. Jimmy, you remember Elaine? She's gonna watch you tonight.",Hi Jimmy. Ouch!

15893,"What? Jerry, I gave you my blood. Listen to your pulse,  hey buddy-hey buddy-hey buddy...","Kramer, I'm not shaving your neck."

16400,"Oh, come on, we all have intense malaise. Right?","I just spoke with her, Elaine. She's in bed."
16401,"Yeah, let me tell you something this is all in her mind, OK? She is insane. She thinks I made her sick because I coughed on her doorknob, rubbed her stapler in my armpit, and put her keyboard on my butt. Yeah, she's a wacko.",So you're Jason Hanke's supervisor?
16402,So you're Jason Hanke's supervisor?,Sponsor.

16406,Admit there's a higher power?,"Yeah, let him chew on that for a while."
16407,"You know George, I think I can help you. We're having a meeting tomorrow. Why don't you just come by?","All right. That's more like it. Thank you very much. By the way, my uncle was an alcoholic, so..."

16418,Why not? It's a good look for a woman.,"Well, the female body is a... work of art. The male body is utilitarian, it's for gettin' around, like a jeep."

16420,"Is, uh, David Puddy there?",This is Puddy.

16433,Oh... yeah. What? I'm sorry.,I wanted to know what you're doing tomorrow.

16439,Waffle or sugar cone?,"Uh, excuse me, uh, um, Jason. I don't want to get into a big thing here, but... I'm not sure if, technically, what you just said was actually an apology."
16440,What?,Can you get on that cone?
16441,Can you get on that cone?,"Would you hang on just a second, son? George, what are you talking about?"
16442,"Would you hang on just a second, son? George, what are you talking about?","Well, it's just, all you said was 'your welcome', which is nice. It's very nice. But... I feel I gotta get the apology."
16443,Is there anybody else here but you?,"I'm alone, and it's my second day. You know, I don't even think we have that flavor so... George, really, enough, ok? You know, I-I admitted I was wrong, so what more do you want from me?"

16549,"Well, what do you think the big holdup is?",The government is very touchy about us being in the air. Let us run around on the ground as much as we want. Anything in the air is a big production.
16550,"Yeah, right. And what about the floating cities?",And the underwater bubble cities?
16551,And the underwater bubble cities?,It's like we're living in the '50s here.
16552,"Would you stop it? You'll have plenty of time to destroy it after I get it. Hey, George, I'm buyin' this car.",Shhh What is wrong with you? You never tell 'em you like the car. You're not sure what you want. You don't even know why you're here.

16554,Since when is Elaine's boyfriend selling cars? I thought he was a mechanic.,I guess he graduated.
16555,"Puddys just gonna give you the car, huh?  You'll see. First they stick you with the undercoating, rust-proofing, dealer prep. Suddenly, you're on your back like a turtle.",All right. Calm down.
16556,"You've got a good eye, there. I see you've noticed the uni-body construction. I'm Rick. Are you looking to buy or to lease?","Uh, borrow. It's for my friend. Yeah, he'll be buying.."
16557,"Yeah, neighbor. That's right. Yeah, why don't we take this boiler out for a shakedown huh?","Look at these salesmen. The only thing these guys fear is the walk-out. No matter what they say, you say, `I'll walk out of here right now!`"

16559,Ah. Whered you go?,"Uh, to a restaurant."

16568,"Hey, Elaine, have you noticed your boyfriend has developed an annoying little habit?",The squinting?
16569,The squinting?,No.
16570,The staring?,No. He keeps asking me to give him a high-five.
16571,It's that bad?,What do you think the Nazis we're doin?  That was the heil-five.
16572,What do you think the Nazis we're doin?  That was the heil-five.,"Isn't that from your act, like, ten years ago?"
16573,"Isn't that from your act, like, ten years ago?","It was a good bit in the 80s, and it's still relatable today."

16579,"Now look, Rick. I'm very close to giving this car, that my celebrity friend is considering, my full endorsement. Oooh, Let's see if I can get a smile from these femininas.. Hey, Ladies!  It's the Saab 900! What do you think? Can I interest you in a little supplemental restraint?!  Geez",I think the candy comes out over there.

16581,How much was under there?,I think somethin bit me. I just need another nickel.
16582,"Hey, Puddy thinks I should go for the CD player. What do you think?","Ho, ho, ho! He's got a live one. He's just reeling his big fish in!"

16585,"Oh? Well, how much gas do you think is in there right now?","Well, it's on `E`."

16587,"Well, how do you know that ones yours?","Uh, it was dangling! There we're only two left in the machine! He must've bought one, and gotten both."
16588,"Sir, are you gonna buy a car?","No!  Hey! Hey! I see you! That is my Twix!  Oh, ha, ha! Ho, ho!"
16589,What did I tell you about that?,"Ah, I, I'm sorry, but the high-five is just so stupid."
16590,Oh yeah? I'll tell you what's stupid. You. Stupid.,"Oh, that is really mature."
16591,Yeah? So are you. You're the grease monkey.,Uh that doesn't make any sense. I am leaving.

16593,Hey! Wh-where are you?,Let's finish this up.

16595,`Rust-proofing`?,"Transport charge, storage surcharge, additional overcharge, finders fee"
16596,`Finders fee`? It was on the lot!,"Yeah, that's right. Uh, floor mats, keys"
16597,Keys?!,How ya gonna start it?
16598,How ya gonna start it?,"Excuse me. I believe you just ate my Twix bar. It was dangling. And when you purchased your Twix bar, you got a little freebie, and you never bothered to ask why, or seek out it's rightful owner."
16599,Nougat? Please. I think I've reached the point in my life where I can tell the difference between nougat and cookie. So let's not just say things that we both know are obvious fabrications.,"You know, you're gettin a little vein there.."

16601,Is someone helping you?,Stay back!
16602,Where is it now?,There's still some overlap between the needle and the slash below the `E`.
16603,How low are you gonna go?,"Oh, I've been in the slash many times. This is nothing. You'll get used to it. Just,  put it out of your mind."
16604,Have you ever been completely below the slash?,"Well, I almost did once, and I blacked out. When I came to, the car was in a ditch, and the tank was full. I don't know who did it, and I never got to thank them.."
16605,"All right, Puddy, listen, and listen good I need to know the name of that mechanic that walks around here. Big guy, a liar. Short name. Sam? Moe? Sol?!","George! Can we focus on the car, here?"
16606,"George! Can we focus on the car, here?",I'm starving! I can feel my stomach sucking up against my spine.

16671,Who is it?,It's Newman.
16672,What do you want? I'm in the middle of something.,I can't believe I'm being evicted.
16673,What? What are you talking about?,The reverse peepholes. Silvio said I'm an agitator and I'm out of the building.

16818,Oh and speaking of issues . Guess who got a no-polish manicure and begged his neighbor not to tell anyone?,I thought you stopped talking??
16819,I thought you stopped talking??,...All right ..Starting now......
16820,You broke up with her just because she cut her hair! how short?,like that
16821,"No, no...... Hey uh.. you want to see a movie?",Actually I think I'm gonna take a few days off
16822,What's that?,We're not breaking up.
16823,W-we're not?,No.
16824,She said no?,She said no.
16825,What did you do?,What could I do?! We fooled around and went to a movie!
16826,What could I do?! We fooled around and went to a movie!,"George, both parties don't have to consent to a break-up. It's not like you're launching missiles from a submarine and you both have to turn your keys. Obviously, you didn't make a convincing case. Let me hear your arguments."
16827,What?,Check these out. These are Jerry Lewis' old cufflinks that he actually wore in the movie `Cinderfella`. I got 'em at an auction.
16828,So you would choose your last meal based on the method of execution?,"Right, right. I mean, if I was getting the chair, I'd go for something... hot and spicy, you know... Thai, maybe Mexican. Lethal injection, feels like pasta... you know, painless, don't want anything too heavy..."
16829,"So, um, why don't we get together some time?","Oh, sure! Why don't you give me your number?"
16830,"Oh, sure! Why don't you give me your number?",I think it'd be better if I called you.
16831,Oh. OK. Maybe we could grab some lunch sometime. D-do you work around here or-?,"Mm mm... no, not really."
16832,"So, is there anything you can tell me about yourself?",I think you're very beautiful.
16833,What about Puddy?,"I haven't talked to him in, like, three weeks... I THINK it might be over..."
16834,"So, what's this guy about?","I don't know. He wouldn't tell me his phone number, where he worked... I'll bet he's in a relationship."
16835,Which one is he?,"Green suit, power ring."
16836,So you bought a cooler?,"No, it's a strongbox to protect my irreplaceables."
16837,And... what would those be?,"Some taxidermy that's been in my family for generations, my Tony, my... military discharge."
16838,You we're in the Army?,"Y- B-briefly. Now, I gotta find a good place to hide this key. Because if somebody finds this, they hold the key to all my possessions."
16839,'Literally'? What's THAT supposed to mean?  You mind if I hide this somewhere?,"No, go ahead."
16840,"A little... privacy, uh?","Oh, come on!"
16841,How long did you last?,"Well, that's classified."
16842,"Hey, what if he's married?",Kramer?!
16843,Kramer?!,"No, the Green Lantern."
16844,"So, you would date a married guy? That's so hacky.","Well, I don't know. I may never marry. It might be the closest I get."
16845,THIS is your hiding place?!,It was under a spoon!
16846,"So, how is a guy like you not involved?",I might ask you the same thing.
16847,How long do I have to hold this?,"Oh, no."
16848,Who is it?,"Um, uh, no one, no one. Here, uh, let me show you a short cut. Come on. Come on."
16849,"Elaine, what are you doin' down there?",You didn't hear me buzzing?
16850,You didn't hear me buzzing?,"Oh, I guess it's broken!"
16851,"...Yeah, you're right. Well, will you at least keep me company until somebody comes out?","All right. Hey, you know what's weird?"
16852,"All right. Hey, you know what's weird?",Huh?
16853,Huh?,I used to be able to have a huge meal and go right to sleep. But I can't anymore.
16854,What are you doin'?,You jammed your key in here? You shorted out my intercom!
16855,You jammed your key in here? You shorted out my intercom!,"You just had to go lookin' for it, didn't you? See, you hate it that I have a little secret. Anything I do -- oooh, oooh! -- you gotta know all about it. You're so OBSESSED with me."
16856,"You just had to go lookin' for it, didn't you? See, you hate it that I have a little secret. Anything I do -- oooh, oooh! -- you gotta know all about it. You're so OBSESSED with me.",I'm gonna go let Elaine in.
16857,"Oo, y- what are you doing with her?",Kramer!
16858,"So, he's definitely married, huh?",Uh...
16859,Where did you get that?,I bought it.
16860,What?,There's been some robberies in the building. I-I can't let you in.
16861,Is that guy still there?,He's starin' at us.
16862,Want a bite?,"Nooo, I don't."
16863,"I think that ginger ale at the coffee shop is just Coke and Sprite mixed together. How can I prove it? Ah! Can't, dammit.","Hey, Honey."
16864,"What? M-Maura, what are you doin' here? I ended this relationship... twice!","George, you didn't mean that. That was just a fight."
16865,Why does it always seem like I'm the only one working at this break-up?,"George, I listened to your arguments, and they we're rambling and flimsy. I'm not convinced. Come on, get dressed and let's get some dinner."
16866,"So, this is your little... love nest?","It's nothing special, just a little place I keep."
16867,"Ah, should I light a fire?","Oh, that sounds... romantic."
16868,"Can you get that, please?","Oh, sure."
16869,Where's Glenn?,"Ah... You're the woman from the street, and I am so sorry. You know, I'm not really a home-wrecker. I-I-I-I-I thought he was a superhero. I swear."
16870,"Lady, I'm not his wife, I'm his welfare caseworker. Is he home?",This is his home?
16871,This is his home?,Yes.
16872,You live on this floor?,Yeah.
16873,Is he wretchedly poor? Does he wear one of those barrels with the straps?,He probably busted it up and burned it for heat.
16874,"So, when are you giving Boxcar Willie his walking papers?",How can I end it over money? I feel bad.
16875,How can I end it over money? I feel bad.,"Well, let's think. Have you ever dealt with the poor in any other situation?"
16876,"Well, let's think. Have you ever dealt with the poor in any other situation?",Yes. There was this homeless guy who used to urinate on our garbage cans.
16877,Good. How did you handle that?,"Well, we gave him a few bucks, and... now he goes in the alley across the street."
16878,"Well, I am NOT paying Glenn off to get out of this relationship. Wh-what am I supposed to do, just walk into his hovel, and hand him... we'll, how much do you think it would be?",Hey.
16879,"Hey, where have you been?","Seeing Maura. Apparently, I was unable to break up beyond a reasonable doubt."
16880,"Who's this, Blue Arrow?",Green Lantern.
16881,... Could you move over there?!,"Hey, you know, there's this secretary at work that always had a crush on me."
16882,Really? How come you never pursued her before?,"She's too tanned. It's the middle of the winter, she's like a carrot."
16883,Did I leave my glasses here?,He can wipe out his checking account in a single bounce!
16884,Who?,"Our neighbor that you... turned against. Anyway, I told him it'd be fine with us if he wanted to let it stretch it's wings out in the hallway."
16885,What'd ya tell him that for?,"Because since you've been playing God with the front door, I've been tryin' to smooth things out, Jerry. In fact, I was just hanging out at his place."
16886,Really? What's it like? Is it nicer than mine? Where does he have the couch?,"Well, I don't know, but the key problem is solved. I hid it at Phil's..."
16887,He let you?,"No, he doesn't know. See, I hid it without tellin' him. So, uh,  Phil won't be compulsively looking for it like some people... You!"
16888,"So, you... you say you've been in the city all winter?",I was in Maine for a couple days.
16889,Are you sure? ''Cause it could really help me out of a jam.,"I want to build something with you, George."
16890,No?,No.
16891,"So, uh, what are we doing in this alley, anyway?",It's a surprise.
16892,What are you doing? What is that?,It's a bag of donuts.
16893,"All right, that's it. How do you spell your last name?",It's a bear claw! You have no idea how rare this is.
16894,I'll make it out to cash. How 'bout two hundred bucks? Two-fifty?,Oooh!
16895,Hi. Is Phil here?,"Yeah, I'm here."
16896,And?,"I thought maybe you'd clean it up, or your maid, there."
16897,Where are you goin'? Help me look!,"It's a big night. I'm, uh, ice skating with one, and going to a staged reading of `Godspell`with the other."
16898,Which is with who?,It doesn't matter.
16899,"Yeah, see? I knew you would lose 'em. That's why I took 'em out of your dresser drawer and put 'em in my strongbox.","You're a lifesaver. Would you get them, please?"
16900,"You're a lifesaver. Would you get them, please?","Yeah, we'll stop by Phil's, we'll pick up the key, uh?"
16901,"Yeah, we'll stop by Phil's, we'll pick up the key, uh?","Hey, what's going on?"
16902,"Hey, what's going on?",Fredo is dead.
16903,That strange Portuguese guy that lives next-door to the incinerator?,No! My bird. We just got back from the pet cemetery.
16904,"Kramer, they think I killed Fredo!  And who buries a bird?","Yeah. Just give it to the Portuguese guy, and he... puts it in the incinerator."
16905,Kramer!?,What?
16906,What?,You killed Fredo!
16907,"Kramer, I need those cufflinks, but now they're in the box, and the key is in the bird... What are we gonna do?",You just answered your own question.
16908,What?,"I mean, uh... I had fun ice skating."

16910,"Maura. Oh, my God! What are you doing here?!",You told me to meet you here for lunch.
16911,I'm Loretta. You want to join us?,"This is all blowing up in my face! My serious girlfriend, and my torrid love affair have accidentally crossed paths. I have ruined three lives... Well, I understand if you never want to see me again, so..."

16913,You?,No.

16919,"So, what are you gonna do? Are you gonna live here, or are you gonna move out, or what?","Ah, I'll just take the fire escape to get in and out of the building."
16920,"So, what's in the cooler?","Oh. Well, would you look at that. I guess I forgot to lock it."
16921,You mean it was open? We desecrated a pet cemetery for nothing?,"Well, this is one for the books, huh, Jerry?... Reeeally one for the books!"

16924,How much was it?,Two hundred. But I'll tell him it's fifty. He doesn't care about the gift. He gets excited about the deal.
16925,Where are you gettin' a Wizard for fifty dollars?,"Ah, I'll tell him I got it on the street, and maybe it's hot. That's his favorite."
16926,Susan's parents? When's the last time you talked to them?,"At the funeral, give or take. You know, deep down, I always kinda felt that they blamed me for Susan's death."

This is what I have to put up with, Jerry. Mr. Kruger? Who said he was going to do some actual work today? Who?"

17595,Would you leave him alone? You'll shatter his confidence!,I don't need any ideas. It's a show about nothing.

17604,So? Where are we going?,I say Japan.
17605,Why Japan?,"Oh - geishas - they cater to your every whim. They're shy at first, but they're quite skilled at conversation. They can discuss anything from world affairs to the fine art of fishing - or baking."
17606,Oh - I got it - how about Russia?,"Russia, it's so bleak."
17607,What about Switzerland?,"Oh - Switzerland - the Von Trapp family, huh?"

17641,We're straightening out?,We're straightening out!
17642,Where are we?,"Latham, Massachusetts. Why don't you take a cab into town, get yourself something to eat. I got your beeper number - I'll beep you as soon as we're ready."

I want to get to Latham, Massachusetts,right away.","So they got Jackie Chiles, huh?  Uh hmm. You know what that means. This whole place is going to be swarming with media by the time this thing is over. You're not going to be able to find a hotel room in this town. The whole country is going to be watching us. Now we got to do whatever it takes to win it, no matter what the cost. The big issue in this trial is going to be character. I want you to find out everything you can about these people - and I mean everything."

17663,"Anything else, Jane?","There also seems to be some friction between Mr. Seinfeld, and Ms. Benes. The rumor is that they once dated, and it's possible that ended badly."

My whole life I've always filled to at least three quarters - sometimes, to the top of the cereal. Now, to conserve, I can't even see the milk anymore. It's a big adjustment."
17668,Is everybody ready? Didn't I tell you I wanted you to wear the cardigan?,It makes me look older.
17669,"Look older? Do you think this is a game? Is that what you think this is? I'm trying to give you amoral compass. You have no moral compass. You're going to walk into that courtroom, and the jury's going to see a mean, nasty, evil George Costanza. I want them to see Perry Como. No one's going to convict Perry Como.

It is a travesty of justice that these four people have been incarcerated while the real perpetrator is walking around laughing - lying and laughing, laughing and lying. You know what these four people we're? They we're innocentbystanders. Now, you just think about that term. Innocent. Bystanders. Because that's exactly what they we're. We know theywere bystanders, nobody's disputing that. So how can a bystander be guilty? No such thing. Have you ever heard of a guilty bystander? No, because you cannot be a bystander and be guilty. Bystanders are by definition, innocent. That is the nature of bystanding. But no, they want to change nature here. They want to create a whole new animal - the guilty bystander. Don't you let them do it. Only you can stop them.",Is the prosecution ready to present it's first witness?

17707,Why would she do something like that?,Because he sent her in there to find out if they we're real.
17708,And what's your occupation?,I'm a library cop.
17709,What does a library cop do?,We chase down library delinquents.
17710,Anyone in this room ever delinquent?,"Yeah, he was. Right over there - Seinfeld."

17714,Why would I do it unless I was in mortal danger? I know it's against the law.,I don't know.
17715,Uromycitisis! I wonder if they're having any trouble controlling themselves during this trial?

17719,Excuse me?,"Uh, excuse me, Your Honor, but what is the point of this testimony? This woman's a low-talker. I can't hear a word she's saying. So either get some other kind of microphone up there, or let's move on."

17722,"Yes, that's right, he was good kid - a lovely boy. Shared his calzone with me - that was a heck of a sandwich, wasn't it, Georgie?","Yes, sir, that was a good sandwich, sir."
17723,What was that?,He was a communist. Thick as they come. Like a big juicy steak.
17724,How could you give twelve million dollars to Hideki Irabu?!,Order!
17725,Cock fighting?,Cock fighting.

17737,And then what happened?,"Hi everybody, I'm Geraldo Rivera and welcome to this special edition of Rivera Live. Well, arguments in the Good Samaritan trial ended today. The jury has been in deliberation for four and a half hours now. Let's go live to Jane Wells who is in Latham, Massachusetts, covering this trial for us. Jane -"
17738,"Jane, whose testimony do you think resonated most strongly with this jury?","That is so hard to say. Certainly there's the doctor with the poison invitations. The Bubble Boy was an extremely sympathetic and tragic figure. And that bizarre contest certainly didn't sit we'll with this small town jury.There's the woman they sold the defective wheelchair to, the deported Pakistani restaurateur. Geraldo, it just went on, and on, and on, into the night."
17739,Do they make you wear uniforms in prison?,I think so.
17740,It's not that bright orange one is it?,"I hope it's not that one, because I cannot wear orange."
17741,Will you stop worrying? Jackie's going to get us off. He never loses. How about when he asked that cop if a black man had ever been to his house. Did you see the look on his face?,"Sorry to bother you, Judge."
17742,How did you get in here?,"Please, if he's found guilty, please be kind to him. He's a good boy."
17743,What do you mean?,You know

17748,What?,"Oh, and by the way, they're real, and they're spectacular."
17749,"If I call Jill from prison, do you think that would make up for the other ones?",Sure.
17750,"I got it - it's out! How about that, huh? Oh, boy, what a relief.","See now, to me, that button is in the worst possible spot."
17751,Really?,"Oh yeah. The second button is the key button. It literally makes or breaks the shirt. Look at it, it's too high, it's in no-man's land."
17752,Haven't we had this conversation before?,You think?
17753,You think?,I think we have.
17754,"So what is the deal with the yard? I mean when I was a kid my mother wanted me to play in the yard. But of course she didn't have to worry about my next door neighbor Tommy sticking a shiv in my thigh. And what's with the lockdown? Why do we have to be locked in our cells? Are we that bad that we have to be sent to prison, in prison? You would think the weightlifting and the sodomy is enough. So, anyone from Cellblock D?",I am.
