47,Where's he going?,The ceremony is over.
48,But he didn't say anything. Did he like her?,"Trust me, Your Grace. If he didn't like her, we'd know."
49,When will they be married?,Soon. The Dothraki never stay still for long.
50,Is it true they lie with their horses?,I wouldn't ask Khal Drogo.
51,Do you take me for a fool?,I take you for a king. Kings lack the caution of common men. My apologies if I've given offense.
52,"So do I. I want us both to go home. But they took it from us. So tell me, sweet sister, how do we go home?",I don't know.
53,Do you think Joffrey will like me? What if he thinks I'm ugly?,Then he is the stupidest prince that ever lived.
54,When would we be married? Soon or do we have to wait?,Hush now. Your father hasn't even said yes.
55,Why would he say no? He'd be the second most powerful man in the kingdoms.,He'd have to leave home. He'd have to leave me. And so would you.
56,Is he dead yet?,Uncle Benjen!
57,You got bigger. I rode all day. Didn't want to leave you alone with the Lannisters. Why aren't you at the feast?,Lady Stark thought it might insult the royal family to seat a bastard in their midst.

75,"If this news is true, and the Lannisters conspire against the throne, who but you can protect the king?",They murdered the last Hand. Now you want Ned to take the job.
76,When do I meet with the Khal? We need to begin planning the invasion.,"If Khal Drogo has promised you a crown, you shall have it."
77,When?,When their omens favor war.
78,"Thank you, ser. Are you from my country?","Ser Jorah Mormont of Bear Island. I served your father for many years. Gods be good, I hope to always serve the rightful king."
79,Do you know the Common Tongue?,Is ‘no' the only word that you know?

86,Isn't there anything else?,The Dothraki have two things in abundance
87,"Well, Mormont, as brutish as this life is, I suppose it is preferable to beheading. What did Ned Stark want you for? Buying from a slaver?",Selling to one... Some poachers I caught on my land.
88,What good will my sympathies do them?,None. But it is expected of you. Your absence has already been noted.
89,"Go! Tell her. But first you will get to Lord and Lady Stark and you will fall on your knees in front of them and tell them how very sorry you are, that you are at their service, and that all your prayers are with them. Do you understand?",You can't...
90,Do you understand?,"The Prince will remember that, little lord."
91,Is Bran going to die?,Apparently not.
92,What do you mean?,The Maester says the boy may live.
93,"Where's your sense of wonder? The greatest structure ever built, the intrepid men of the Night's Watch, the wintry abode of the White Walkers.",Tell me you're not thinking of taking the black.
94,And go celibate? The whores would go begging from Dorne to Casterly Rock. I just want to stand on top of the Wall and piss off the edge of the world.,The children don't need to hear your filth. Come.
95,"This is your home. I'm your guest. Handsome one, isn't he? I lost my first boy, a little black-haired beauty. He was a fighter too... Tried to beat the fever that took him. Forgive me. It's the last thing you need to hear right now.",I never knew.
96,A sword for the wall?,I already have one.
97,Good man. Have you swung it yet?,Of course I have.
98,"Is it ""we"" already? Have you taken your vows then?",Soon enough.
99,"Thank you, Nymeria. Septa Mordane says I have to do it again. ""My things weren't properly folded"", she says. Who cares how they're folded?! They're going to get all messed up anyway.",It's good you've got help.
100,A present?,Close the door. This is no toy. Be careful you don't cut yourself.
101,You'll have to work at it every day. How does it feel? Do you like the balance?,I think so.
102,You've said goodbye to Bran? He's not going to die. I know it.,You Starks are hard to kill.
103,My mother?,She was very kind.
104,"Is my mother alive? Does she know about me? Where I am, where I'm going? Does she care?","The next time we see each other, we'll talk about your mother. I promise."
105,"There was that one... Oh, what was her name? That common girl of yours? Becca? With the great big tits you could bury your face in.",Bessie. She was one of yours.
106,Bessie! Thank the gods for Bessie and her tits. Yours was... Aleena? No. You told me once. Meryl? Your bastardo s mother?,Wylla.
107,Daenerys Targaryen has wed some Dothraki horselord. What of it? Should we send her a wedding gift?,"A knife perhaps, a good sharp one, and a bold man to wield it."
108,"Oh, it's unspeakable to you? What her father did to your family... That was unspeakable. What Rhaegar Targaryen did to your sister... the woman I loved. I'll kill every Targaryen I get my hands on.","But you can't get your hands on this one, can you?"
109,"But you can't get your hands on this one, can you?","This Khal Drogo, it's said he has 100,000 men in his horde."
110,Rapers. They were given a choice no doubt... Castration or the Wall. Most choose the knife. Not impressed by your new brothers? Lovely thing about the Watch... You discard your old family and get a whole new one.,Why do you read so much?
111,Why do you read so much?,Look at me and tell me what you see.
112,Is this a trick?,"What you see is a dwarf. If I'd been born a peasant they might've left me out in the woods to die. Alas, I was born a Lannister of Casterly Rock. Things are expected of me. My father was the Hand of the King for 20 years."
113,"Yes, until my brother killed him. Life is full of these little ironies. My sister married the new King and my repulsive nephew will be King after him. I must do my part for the honor of my house, wouldn't you agree? But how? Well, my brother has his sword and I have my mind. And a mind needs books like a sword needs a whetstone. That's why I read so much. And you? What's your story, bastard?","Ask me nicely and maybe I'll tell you, dwarf."
114,When was the last time you left this room?,I have to take care of him.
115,What if he's wrong? Bran needs me.,"Rickon needs you. He's six. He doesn't know what's happening. He follows me around all day, clutching my leg, crying..."
116,Have you ever seen a dragon?,"Dragon gone, Khaleesi."
117,Everywhere? Even in the east?,No dragon. Brave men kill them. It is known.
118,The moon?,"He told me the moon was an egg, Khaleesi, that once there were two moons in the sky. But one wandered too close to the sun and it cracked from the heat. Out of it poured a thousand thousand dragons and they drank the sun's fire."
119,Leave me with her. Why did the trader from Garth tell you these stories?,"Men like to talk when they're happy. Before your brother bought me for you, it was my job to make men happy."
120,How old were you?,I was nine when my mother sold me to the pleasure house.
121,Nine?!,"I did not touch a man for three years, Khaleesi. First you must learn."
122,Can you teach me how to make the Khal happy?,Yes.
123,Will it take three years?,No.
124,Someone tried to kill him twice. Why? Why murder an innocent child? Unless he saw something he wasn't meant to see.,"Saw what, my lady?"
125,"Saw what, my lady?",I don't know. But I would stake my life the Lannisters are involved. We already have reason to suspect their loyalty to the crown.
126,"Did you notice the dagger the killer used? It's too fine a weapon for such a man. The blade is Valyrian steel, the handle dragonbone. Someone gave it to him.",They come into our home and try to murder my brother? If it's war they want...
127,They come into our home and try to murder my brother? If it's war they want...,"If it comes to that, you know I'll stand behind you."
128,"What, is there going to be a battle in the Godswood? Too easily words of war become acts of war. We don't know the truth yet. Lord Stark must be told of this.",I don't trust a raven to carry these words.
129,What about Bran?,I have prayed to the Seven for more than a month. Bran's life is in their hands now.
130,Finish a man?,Kings traveled across the world for a night with Irogenia. Magisters sold their palaces. Khals burned her enemies just to have her for a few hours. They say a thousand men proposed to her and she refused them all.
131,"You will make him like it, Khaleesi. Men want what they've never had. And the Dothraki take slaves like a hound takes a bitch. Are you a slave, Khaleesi? Then don't make love like a slave. Very good, Khaleesi. Out there he is the mighty Khal, but in this tent, he belongs to you.",I don't think that this is the Dothraki way.
132,"If he wanted the Dothraki way, why did he marry you?",No. No. Tonight I would look upon your face.
133,"Do I frighten you so much, girl? Or is it him there making you shake? He frightens me too. Look at that face.","I'm sorry if I offended you, Ser. Why won't he speak to me?"
134,"I'm sorry if I offended you, Ser. Why won't he speak to me?",He hasn't been very talkative these last 20 years. Since the mad King had his tongue ripped out with hot pincers.
135,"He speaks damn well with his sword though. Ser Ilyn Payne, the King's justice. The royal executioner. What is it, sweet lady? Does the hound frighten you? Away with you, dog. You're scaring my lady. I don't like to see you upset. The sun is finally shining. Come walk with me.","Stay, Lady. I probably shouldn't have any more. Father only lets us have one cup at feasts."
136,What are you doing here? Go away.,"Your sister? And who are you, boy?"
137,"Your sister? And who are you, boy?","Mycah, my Lord."
138,"A butcher's boy who wants to be a Knight, eh? Pick up your sword, butcher's boy. Let's see how good you are.","She asked me to, my Lord. She asked me to."
139,"And you're not a Knight. Only a butcher's boy. That was my lady's sister you were hitting, do you know that?",Stop it!
140,Where is she?,She's been taken directly before the King.
141,Who took her?,The Lannisters found her.
142,Are you hurt?,No.
143,It's all right. What is the meaning of this? Why was my daughter not brought to me at once?,How dare you speak to your King in that manner?
144,How dare you speak to your King in that manner?,"Quiet, woman. Sorry, Ned. I never meant to frighten the girl. But we need to get this business done quickly."
145,"Enough! He tells me one thing, she tells me another. Seven hells! What am I to make of this? Where's your other daughter, Ned?",In bed asleep.
146,"What would you have me do, whip her through the streets? Damn it, children fight. It's over.",Joffrey will bear these scars for the rest of his life.
147,You let that little girl disarm you? See to it that your daughter is disciplined. I'll do the same with my son.,"Gladly, your Grace."
148,And what of the direwolf? What of the beast that savaged your son?,I'd forgot the damned wolf.
149,"He doesn't mean Lady, does he? No no, not Lady! Lady didn't bite anyone! She's good!",Lady wasn't there! You leave her alone!
150,s this your command... your Grace?,Where is the beast?
151,Where is the beast?,"Chained up outside, your Grace."
152,Is this some trick?,The wolf is of the north. She deserves better than a butcher.
153,The butcher's boy... You rode him down?,He ran... Not very fast.
154,"Sturdy old thing. How many kings' asses have polished it, I wonder? What's the line? The King shits and the Hand wipes.",Very handsome armor. Not a scratch on it.
155,"500 men just stood there and watched. All the great knights of the Seven Kingdoms. You think anyone said a word, lifted a finger? No, Lord Stark. 500 men and this room was silent as a crypt. Except for the screams, of course, and the Mad King laughing. And later... When I watched the Mad King die, I remembered him laughing as your father burned... It felt like justice.",Is that what you tell yourself at night? You're a servant of justice? That you were avenging my father when you shoved your sword in Aerys Targaryen's back?
156,Is that what you tell yourself at night? You're a servant of justice? That you were avenging my father when you shoved your sword in Aerys Targaryen's back?,"Tell me... If I'd stabbed the Mad King in the belly instead of the back, would you admire me more?"
157,"Tell me... If I'd stabbed the Mad King in the belly instead of the back, would you admire me more?","You served him well, when serving was safe."
158,How many years has it been? You were a young man.,And you served another King.
159,"How forgetful of me. This belongs to you, now. Should we begin?",Without the King?
160,Without the King?,"Winter may be coming, but I'm afraid the same cannot be said for my brother."
161,"Mmm, how much?","40,000 gold dragons to the champion, 20,000 to the runner-up, 20,000 to the winning archer."
162,Can the treasury bear such expense?,"I'll have to borrow it. The Lannisters will accommodate, I expect. We already owe Lord Tywin 3 million gold. What's another 80,000?"
163,"I'll have to borrow it. The Lannisters will accommodate, I expect. We already owe Lord Tywin 3 million gold. What's another 80,000?",Are you telling me the Crown is three million in debt?
164,Are you telling me the Crown is three million in debt?,I'm telling you the Crown is six million in debt.
165,How could you let this happen?,The Master of Coin finds the money. The King and the Hand spend it.
166,Do I have to marry her?,"Yes. She's very beautiful and young. If you don't like her, you only need to see her on formal occasions and when the time comes, to make little princes and princesses. And if you'd rather fuck painted whores, you'll fuck painted whores. And if you'd rather lie with noble virgins, so be it. You are my darling boy and the world will be exactly as you want it to be. Do something nice for the Stark girl."
167,How would you handle them?,"I'd double their taxes and command them to supply 10,000 men to the royal army."
168,A royal army?,"Why should every lord command his own men? It's primitive, no better than the hill tribes. We should have a standing army of men loyal to the Crown, trained by experienced soldiers... Instead of a mob of peasants who've never held pikes in their lives."
169,"Why should every lord command his own men? It's primitive, no better than the hill tribes. We should have a standing army of men loyal to the Crown, trained by experienced soldiers... Instead of a mob of peasants who've never held pikes in their lives.",And if the northerners rebel?
170,And if the northerners rebel?,"I'd crush them. Seize Winterfell and install someone loyal to the realm as Warden of the North. Uncle Kevan, maybe."
171,"And these 10,000 northern troops, would they fight for you or their lord?",For me. I'm their King.
172,So you agree... The Starks are enemies?,Everyone who isn't us is an enemy.
173,Practicing for what?,The Prince.
174,What's happening here?,Arya would rather act like a beast than a lady.
175,The same dollmaker makes all of Princess Myrcella's toys. Don't you like it?,I haven't played with dolls since I was eight. May I be excused?
176,I haven't played with dolls since I was eight. May I be excused?,You've barely eaten a thing.
177,"Arya, open the door. May I come in? Whose sword is that?",Mine.
178,Give it to me. I know this maker's mark. This is Mikken's work. Where did you get this? This is no toy. Little ladies shouldn't play with swords.,I wasn't playing. And I don't want to be a lady.
179,Come here. Now what do you want with this?,It's called Needle.
180,A blade with a name. And who were you hoping to skewer with Needle? Your sister? Do you know the first thing about sword fighting?,Stick 'em with the pointy end.
181,But how you can let her marry someone like that?,Well… Look at me. You're a Stark of Winterfell. You know our words.
182,"I don't want to frighten you, but I won't lie to you either. We've come to a dangerous place. We cannot fight a war amongst ourselves. All right? Go on. It's yours.",I can keep it?
183,I can keep it?,"Try not to stab your sister with it. If you're going to own a sword, you'd better know how to use it."
184,"Oh, my sweet summer child. What do you know about fear? Fear is for the winter, when the snows fall a hundred feet deep. Fear is for the long night, when the sun hides for years and children are born and live and die all in darkness. That is the time for fear, my little Lord, when the White Walkers move through the woods. Thousands of years ago there came a night that lasted a generation. Kings froze to death in their castles, same as the shepherds in their huts. And women smothered their babies rather than see them starve, and wept and felt the tears freeze on their cheeks. So is this the sort of story that you like? In that darkness, the White Walkers came for the first time. They swept through cities and kingdoms, riding their dead horses, hunting with their packs of pale spiders big as hounds…",What are you telling him now?
185,What are you telling him now?,Only what the little Lord wants to hear.
186,"How do you feel? You still don't remember anything? I've seen you climb a thousand times. In the wind, in the rain... A thousand times. You never fall.","I did though. It's true, isn't it... what Maester Luwin says about my legs? I'd rather be dead."
187,"I did though. It's true, isn't it... what Maester Luwin says about my legs? I'd rather be dead.",Don't ever say that.
188,"Welcome to King's Landing, Lady Stark. Would you mind following us?",I would. We've done nothing wrong.
189,"Instructed? I don't know who's providing your instructions, but...","Follow me, Lady Stark."
190,How dare you bring me here! Have you lost your mind?,No one will come looking for you here. Isn't that what like you wanted? I'm truly sorry... about the locale.
191,No one will come looking for you here. Isn't that what like you wanted? I'm truly sorry... about the locale.,How did you know I was coming to King's Landing?
192,How did you know I was coming to King's Landing?,A dear friend told me.
193,How did you know I was coming?,"Knowledge is my trade, my Lady. Did you bring the dagger with you, by any chance? My little birds are everywhere. Even in the north. They whisper to me the strangest stories. Valyrian steel."
194,"Knowledge is my trade, my Lady. Did you bring the dagger with you, by any chance? My little birds are everywhere. Even in the north. They whisper to me the strangest stories. Valyrian steel.",Do you know whose dagger this is?
195,Do you know whose dagger this is?,I must admit I do not.
196,Yours?,"At least it was, until the tournament on Prince Joffrey's last nameday. I bet on Ser Jaime in the jousting, as any sane man would. When the Knight of the Flowers unseated him, I lost this dagger."
197,To whom?,Tyrion Lannister. The Imp.
198,"If that were a real sword, you'd be dead. Lord Snow here grew up in a castle spitting down on the likes of you. Pyp. Do you think Ned Stark's bastard bleeds like the rest of us?",Next!
199,"And how's that going, Commander Mormont?",Slowly. A raven came for Ned Stark's son.
200,Good news or bad?,Both.
201,Good news? Perhaps you'd like to share it with your wife?,My wife is in Winterfell.
202,Is she?,I thought that she'd be safest in here. One of several such establishments I own.
203,"What're you looking at, halfman?",I'm looking at you. You've got an interesting face. Very distinctive faces. All of you.
204,What do you care about our faces?,"It's just I think they would look marvelous decorating spikes in King's Landing. Perhaps I'll write my sister, the Queen, about it."
205,How could you be so stupid?,Calm down.
206,He's a child... 10 years old. What were you thinking?,I was thinking of us. You're a bit late to start complaining about it now. What has the boy told them?
207,I was thinking of us. You're a bit late to start complaining about it now. What has the boy told them?,Nothing. He's said nothing. He remembers nothing.
208,Then what are you raving about?,What if it comes back to him? If he tells his father what he saw...
209,What if it comes back to him? If he tells his father what he saw...,We'll say he was lying. We'll say he was dreaming. We'll say whatever we like. I think we can outfox a 10-year-old.
210,And my husband?,I'll go to war with him if I have to. They can write a ballad about us
211,And if you find the proof?,"Then I bring it to Robert... And hope he's still the man I once knew. You watch yourself on the road, huh? That temper of yours is a dangerous thing."
212,"Then I bring it to Robert... And hope he's still the man I once knew. You watch yourself on the road, huh? That temper of yours is a dangerous thing.","My temper? Gods be good, you nearly killed poor Littlefinger yesterday."
213,"My temper? Gods be good, you nearly killed poor Littlefinger yesterday.",He still loves you.
214,Does he?,Off with you.
215,It's been a long time. But I still remember every face. You remember your first?,"Of course, your Grace."
216,Who was it?,A Tyroshi. Never learned the name.
217,How'd you do it?,Lance through the heart.
218,"Quick one. Lucky for you. Mine was some Tarly boy at the Battle of Summerhall. My horse took an arrow so I was on foot, slogging through the mud. He came running at me, this dumb high-born lad, thinking he could end the rebellion with the single swing of his sword. I knocked him down with the hammer. Gods, I was strong then. Caved in his breastplate. Probably shattered every rib he had. Stood over him, hammer in the air. Right before I brought it down he shouted, ""Wait! Wait!""... They never tell you how they all shit themselves. They don't put that part in the songs. Stupid boy. Now the Tarlys bend the knee like everyone else. He could have lingered on the edge of the battle with the smart boys and today his wife would be making him miserable, his sons would be ingrates, and he'd be waking three times in the night to piss into a bowl. Wine! Lancel. Gods, what a stupid name. Lancel Lannister. Who named you? Some halfwit with a stutter? What are you doing?","It's empty, your Grace."
219,What do you mean it's empty?,There's no more wine.
220,"Is that what empty means?! So get more. Tell your cousin to get in here. Kingslayer! Get in here. Surrounded by Lannisters. Every time I close my eyes I see their blond hair and their smug, satisfied faces. It must wound your pride, huh? Standing out there like a glorified sentry. Jaime Lannister, son of the mighty Tywin... Forced to mind the door while your King eats and drinks and shits and fucks. So come on. We're telling war stories. Who was your first kill, not counting old men?",One of the outlaws in the Brotherhood.
221,Your outlaw... Any last words?,"I cut his head off, so no."
222,What about Aerys Targaryen? What did the Mad King say when you stabbed him in the back? I never asked. Did he call you a traitor? Did he plead for a reprieve?,"He said the same thing he'd been saying for hours... ""Burn them all."" If that's all, your Grace..."
223,From whom?,"If you rule a city and you see the horde approaching, you have two choices"
224,You want the entire horde to stop? For how long?,Until I command them otherwise.
225,You dare! You give commands to me? To me? You do not command the dragon. I am Lord of the Seven Kingdoms. I don't take orders from savages or their sluts. Do you hear me?,"Rakharo ask if you want him dead, Khaleesi."
226,"Shall we return to the Khalasar, Khaleesi?",You walk. [to Viserys]
227,You're leaving?,I'm the First Ranger. My job is out there. There have been disturbing reports.
228,What kind of reports?,The kind I don't want to believe.
229,You're joking?,"And his brains and his guts, his lungs and his heart all fried in his own fat. When you're a hundred miles north of the Wall and you ate your last meal a week ago, you leave nothing for the wolves."
230,And how do a bear's balls taste?,"A bit chewy. And what about you, my Lord? What's the strangest thing you've eaten?"
231,"A bit chewy. And what about you, my Lord? What's the strangest thing you've eaten?","Do Dornish girls count? So you roam the Seven Kingdoms, collaring pickpockets and horse thieves and bringing them here as eager recruits?"
232,"Do Dornish girls count? So you roam the Seven Kingdoms, collaring pickpockets and horse thieves and bringing them here as eager recruits?",But it's not all of 'em's done bad things. Some of 'em's just poor lads looking for steady feed. Some of 'em's high-born lads looking for glory.
233,"The Night's Watch is a joke to you, is it? Is that what we are, Lannister? An army of jesters in black?","You don't have enough men to be an army and aside from Yoren here, none of you are particularly funny."
234,"Do you think I'm plump? Listen, Benjen... May I call you Benjen?",Call me what you like.
235,"Are you going below? Keep well, keep warm.","Enjoy the capital, brother."
236,"I think he's starting to like me. ""Going below""?",Into the tunnel and out the other side. He'll be north of the Wall for a month or two.
237,What are you doing?,"When was last time you bleed, Khaleesi? You change, Khaleesi. It's a blessing from the Great Stallion."
238,"When was last time you bleed, Khaleesi? You change, Khaleesi. It's a blessing from the Great Stallion.","For a man on horseback, the curved blade is a good thing, easier to handle. It's a good weapon for a Dothrakan. But a man in full plate... the arakh won't get through the steel. That's where the broadsword has the advantage. Designed for piercing plate."
239,Armor. Armor make a man... Vroz?,Slow.
240,"He was bloodrider to Khal Bharbo. And your father, Jorah the Andal? He was a warrior also?",He still is. A man of great honor. And I betrayed him.
241,"Have you seen any ducks, woman? No rabbits, no ducks. Do you have eyes in your head? Do you?",Dog then. I have seen many dogs.
242,"How many winters have you seen, Lord Tyrion?","Eight... no, nine."
243,All of them brief?,"They say the winter of my birth was three years long, Maester Aemon."
244,How do you know?,I know.
245,Will you stop at Winterfell on your way South?,I expect I will. Gods know there aren't many feather beds between here and King's Landing.
246,Who are you?,"Your dancing master, Syrio Forel."
247,What if I drop it?,"The steel must be part of your arm. Can you drop part of your arm? No. Nine years Syrio Forel was first sword to the Sealord of Braavos. He knows these things. You must listen to me, boy."
248,"The steel must be part of your arm. Can you drop part of your arm? No. Nine years Syrio Forel was first sword to the Sealord of Braavos. He knows these things. You must listen to me, boy.",I'm a girl.
249,"Ahhh… Just so. Now we will begin the dance. Remember, child, this is not the dance of the Westeros we are learning... The knight's dance, hacking and hammering. This is the Bravo's dance... The water dance. It is swift and sudden. All men are made of water, do you know this? If you pierce them, the water leaks out and they die. Now you will try to strike me.","Up! Dead. Dead. Very dead. Come. Again, faster."
250,"Really? If I was cooped up all day with no one but this old bat for company, I'd go mad. Anyway, you don't have a choice. Robb's waiting.",I don't want to go.
251,"Any man of the Night's Watch, but not I, eh, boy?","I'm not your boy, Lannister. I'm Lord of Winterfell while my father is away."
252,So it's true. Hello Bran. Do you remember anything about what happened?,He has no memory of that day.
253,Why are you here?,Would your charming companion be so kind as to kneel? My neck is beginning to hurt.
254,Would your charming companion be so kind as to kneel? My neck is beginning to hurt.,"Kneel, Hodor."
255,"Do you like to ride, Bran?","Yes. Well, I mean I did like to."
256,"What of it? With the right horse and saddle, even a cripple can ride.",I'm not a cripple.
257,Will I really be able to ride?,You will. On horseback you will be as tall as any of them.
258,Is this some kind of trick? Why do you want to help him?,"I have a tender spot in my heart for cripples, bastards and broken things."
259,"Couldn't resist some northern ass? If you like redheads, ask for Ros.","Come to see me off, Greyjoy? Kind of you. Your master doesn't seem to like Lannisters."
260,"Come to see me off, Greyjoy? Kind of you. Your master doesn't seem to like Lannisters.",He's not my master.
261,"No, of course not. What happened here? Where is lady Stark? Why didn't she receive me?",She wasn't feeling well.
262,"She's not in Winterfell, is she? Where did she go?",My lady's whereabouts...
263,"My lady? Your loyalty to your captors is touching. Tell me, how do you think Balon Greyjoy would feel if he could see his only surviving son has turned lackey? I still remember seeing my father's fleet burn in Lannisport. I believe your uncles were responsible?",Must have been a pretty sight.
264,What in seven hells is that?,They'll need an eighth hell to fit him in.
265,Are you sure you want to do this?,No. Yield yield yield! I yield.
266,Did he hurt you?,I've had worse.
267,"It's not going to get any easier, you know? You'll have to defend yourself.",Why didn't you get up and fight?
268,Why didn't you get up and fight?,I wanted to. I just couldn't.
269,Why not?,I'm a coward. My father always says so.
270,"If my brother was given an army of Dothraki, could you conquer the Seven Kingdoms?",The Dothraki have never crossed the Narrow Sea. They fear any water their horses can't drink.
271,But if they did?,"King Robert is fool enough to meet them in open battle, but the men advising him are different."
272,And you know these men?,"I fought beside them once, long ago. Now Ned Stark wants my head. He drove me from my land."
273,Why?,I had no money and an expensive wife.
274,And where is she now?,"In another place, with another man."
275,Your Grace?,"Yes, my dear?"
276,"Yes, my dear?",They call you the last dragon...
277,You have dragon's blood in your veins?,It's entirely possible.
278,What happened to the dragons? I was told that brave men killed them all.,"The brave men didn't kill dragons. The brave men rode them. Rode them from Valyria to build the greatest civilization this world has ever seen. The breath of the greatest dragon forged the Iron Throne, which the Usurper is keeping warm for me. The swords of the vanquished, a thousand of them... melted together like so many candles."
279,Really? Why dragons?,"They can fly. And wherever they are, just a few flaps of their wings and they're somewhere else... Far away. And they can kill. Anyone or anything that tries to hurt them gets burned away to nothing... melted... like so many candles. Seeing a dragon would make me very happy."
280,What have you seen?,I've seen... A man from Asshai with a dagger of real dragonglass. I've seen a man who could change his face the way that other men change their clothes. And I've seen a pirate who wore his weight in gold and whose ship had sails of colored silk. So... Have you seen one?
281,I've seen... A man from Asshai with a dagger of real dragonglass. I've seen a man who could change his face the way that other men change their clothes. And I've seen a pirate who wore his weight in gold and whose ship had sails of colored silk. So... Have you seen one?,A pirate ship?
282,A pirate ship?,A dragon.
283,What happened to the skulls?,"I don't know. The Usurper had them smashed to powder, I expect. Scattered to the wind."
284,"Yes, it is. What did I buy you for? To make me sad?","No, your Grace. To teach your sister."
285,To teach my sister how to be a better lover? You think I bought you to make Khal Drogo happy? You pretty little idiot. Go on then. Get on with it.,"Someday your husband will sit there and you will sit by his side. And one day, before too long, you will present your son to the court. All the lords of Westeros will gather here to see the little prince..."
286,What if I have a girl?,"Gods be good, you'll have boys and girls and plenty of them."
287,What if I only have girls?,I wouldn't worry about that.
288,But what if?,"If you only had girls, I suppose the throne would pass to Prince Joffrey's little brother."
289,Nonsense. Why would you say such a thing? That business with the wolves? I've told you a hundred times... A direwolf is not...,Please shut up about it.
290,Do you remember your lessons? Who built the Iron Throne?,Aegon the Conqueror.
291,And who built the Red Keep?,Maegor the Cruel.
292,"My grandfather and uncle were murdered here, weren't they?","They were killed on the orders of King Aerys, yes."
293,Why were they killed?,You should speak to your father about these matters.
294,I will?,"You found money for a champion's purse, you can find money to keep the peace. I'll also give you 20 of my household guards till the crowds have left."
295,"I'm sure the tourney puts coins in many a pocket. Now... If there's nothing else, my Lords?","This heat. On days like this, I envy you northerners your summer snows. Until tomorrow my Lord."
296,"Lord Arryn? His death was a great sadness to all of us. I took personal charge of his care, but I could not save him. His sickness struck him very hard and very fast. I saw him in my chambers just the night before he passed. Lord Jon often came to me for counsel.",Why?
297,Why?,I have been Grand Maester for many years. Kings and Hands have come to me for advice since...
298,What did Jon want the night before he died?,He came inquiring after a book.
299,A book? What book?,"I fear it would be of little interest to you, my Lord. A ponderous tome."
300,Did Jon Arryn tell you what he wanted with it?,"He did not, my Lord. And I did not presume to ask."
301,Did he say anything to you during his final hours?,"Nothing of import, my Lord. There was one phrase he kept repeating"
302,"The seed is strong""? What does that mean?","The dying mind is a demented mind, Lord Stark. For all the weight they're given, last words are usually as significant as first words."
303,And you're quite certain he died of a natural illness?,What else could it be?
304,What else could it be?,Poison.
305,"Yes. Women, cravens... and eunuchs. Did you know that lord Varys is a eunuch?",Everybody knows that.
306,Cats? Syrio says…,He says every swordsman should study cats. They're quiet as shadows and as light as feathers. You have to be quick to catch them.
307,Now that Bran's awake will he come live with us?,He needs to get his strength back first.
308,"He wants to be a knight of the King's Guard. He can't be one now, can he?",No. But someday he could be Lord of a holdfast or sit on the King's Council. Or he might raise castles like Brandon the Builder.
309,Can I be Lord of a holdfast?,You will marry a high Lord and rule his castle. And your sons shall be knights and princes and lords.
310,"You can't fight. You can't see. You're afraid of heights and almost everything else probably. What are you doing here, Sam?","On the morning of my 18th nameday, my father came to me. ""You're almost a man now,"" he said, ""but you're not worthy of my land and title. Tomorrow, you're going to take the black, forsake all claim to your inheritance and start north. If you do not,"" he said, ""then we'll have a hunt and somewhere in these woods your horse will stumble and you'll be thrown from your saddle to die. Or so I'll tell your mother. Nothing would please me more."" Ser Alliser's going to make me fight again tomorrow, isn't he?"
311,"On the morning of my 18th nameday, my father came to me. ""You're almost a man now,"" he said, ""but you're not worthy of my land and title. Tomorrow, you're going to take the black, forsake all claim to your inheritance and start north. If you do not,"" he said, ""then we'll have a hunt and somewhere in these woods your horse will stumble and you'll be thrown from your saddle to die. Or so I'll tell your mother. Nothing would please me more."" Ser Alliser's going to make me fight again tomorrow, isn't he?","Yes, he is."
312,"I'm not going to get any better, you know?",Well… You can't get any worse.
313,"He never stops. Do you know Ser Hugh of the Vale? Not surprising. Until recently, he was only a squire... Jon Arryn's squire. He was knighted almost immediately after his master's untimely death.",Knighted for what? Why are you telling me this?
314,Knighted for what? Why are you telling me this?,I promised Cat that I'd help you.
315,Where is Ser Hugh? I'll speak to him.,A singularly bad idea. Do you see that boy there? One of Varys's little birds. The Spider has taken a great interest in your comings and goings. Now look there. That one belongs to the Queen. And do you see that Septa pretending to read her book?
316,A singularly bad idea. Do you see that boy there? One of Varys's little birds. The Spider has taken a great interest in your comings and goings. Now look there. That one belongs to the Queen. And do you see that Septa pretending to read her book?,Varys or the Queen?
317,Varys or the Queen?,No. She's one of mine. Is there someone in your service whom you trust completely?
318,No. She's one of mine. Is there someone in your service whom you trust completely?,Yes.
319,Ser Hugh? Ser Hugh!,"As you can see, I'm busy."
320,What did Lord Arryn want?,He always came to see the boy.
321,"There's nothing to forgive. When Lord Arryn came to visit you, what would you talk about?","He just asked me questions is all, my Lord."
322,What kind of questions?,"About my work at first, if I was being treated well, if I liked it here. But then he started asking me about my mother."
323,Your mother?,"Who she was, what she looked like."
324,What did you tell him?,She died when I was little. She had yellow hair. She'd sing to me sometimes.
325,Find anything?,King Robert's bastard son.
326,Listen. Do you hear them? How many do you think are in there with him? Guess.,Three? Four?
327,Three? Four?,He likes to do this when I'm on duty... He makes me listen as he insults my sister.
328,Why do I have to forgive you? Have you wronged me?,"We've met before, you know."
329,"Have we? Strange, I've forgotten.",The siege of Pyke. We fought side by side one afternoon.
330,That's where you got your scar?,Aye. One of the Greyjoys nearly took my eye.
331,They stopped liking it at the end. That was a proper battle. D'you remember Thoros of Myr charging through the breach?,With his burning sword? I'll remember that till the day I die.
332,With his burning sword? I'll remember that till the day I die.,I saw the youngest of the Greyjoy lads at Winterfell. It was like seeing a shark on a mountaintop.
333,Theon? He's a good lad.,I doubt it.
334,Can I leave this with you? The message from Lord Stark.,I don't serve Lord Stark.
335,Where have you been?,Watch duty. With Sam.
336,Prince Porkchop. Where is he?,He wasn't hungry.
337,"What are you waiting for? Attack him! You, get in there.","Hit me. Go on, hit me! I yield! Yield yield. I yield."
338,"You think this is funny, do you? When you're out there beyond the Wall with the sun going down, do you want a man at your back? Or a sniveling boy?",You send this whore to give me commands? I should have sent you back her head!
339,You send this whore to give me commands? I should have sent you back her head!,"Forgive me, Khaleesi. I did as you asked."
340,Why did you hit her?!,How many times do I have to tell you? You do not command me.
341,How many times do I have to tell you? You do not command me.,I wasn't commanding you. I just wanted to invite you to supper.
342,What's this?,It's a gift. I had it made for you.
343,Dothraki rags? Are you going to dress me now?,Please.
344,"You would turn me into one of them, wouldn't you? Next you'll want to braid my hair.",You've no right to a braid. You've won no victories yet.
345,Don't you think it's a little bit unfair? Making us take our vows while they sneak off for a little sally on the side?,Sally on the side?
346,Sally on the side?,"It's silly, isn't it? What, we can't defend the Wall unless we're celibate? It's absurd."
347,"It's silly, isn't it? What, we can't defend the Wall unless we're celibate? It's absurd.",I didn't think you'd be so upset about it.
348,Why not? Because I'm fat? But I like girls just as much as you do. They might not like me as much. I've never... been with one. You've probably had hundreds.,"As a matter of fact, I'm the same as you."
349,You didn't know where to put it?,I know where to put it.
350,Was she... Old and ugly?,Young and gorgeous. A whore named Ros.
351,What color hair?,Red.
352,That good?,Better.
353,What's my name?,Jon Snow?
354,Jon Snow?,And why is my surname Snow?
355,And why is my surname Snow?,Because... You're a bastard from the north.
356,"I never met my mother. My father wouldn't even tell me her name. I don't know if she's living or dead. I don't know if she's a noblewoman or a fisherman's wife... Or a whore. So I sat there in the brothel as Ros took off her clothes. But I couldn't do it. Because all I could think was what if I got her pregnant and she had a child, another bastard named Snow? It's not a good life for a child.",So... You didn't know where to put it?
357,So... You didn't know where to put it?,"Enjoying yourselves? You look cold, boys."
358,"Enjoying yourselves? You look cold, boys.",It is a bit nippy.
359,"A bit nippy, yeah, by the fire, indoors. It's still summer. Do you boys even remember the last winter? How long has it been now? What, 10 years? I remember. Was it uncomfortable at Winterfell? Were there days when you just couldn't get warm, never mind how many fires your servants built?",I build my own fires.
360,"That's admirable. I spent six months out there, beyond the Wall during the last winter. It was supposed to be a two-week mission. We heard a rumor Mance Rayder was planning to attack Eastwatch. So we went out to look for some of his men... Capture them, gather some knowledge. The Wildlings who fight for Mance Rayder are hard men. Harder than you'll ever be. They know their country better than we do. They knew there was a storm coming in. So they hid in their caves and waited for it to pass. And we got caught in the open. Wind so strong it yanked 100-foot trees straight from the ground, roots and all. If you took your gloves off to find your cock to have a piss, you lost a finger to the frost. And all in darkness. You don't know cold. Neither of you do. The horses died first. We didn't have enough to feed them, to keep them warm. Eating the horses was easy. But later when we started to fall... That wasn't easy. We should have had a couple of boys like you along, shouldn't we? Soft, fat boys like you. We'd have lasted a fortnight on you and still had bones leftover for soup. Soon we'll have new recruits and you lot will be passed along to the Lord Commander for assignment and they will call you men of the Night's Watch, but you'd be fools to believe it. You're boys still. And come the winter you will die... Like flies.",I hit him. I hit the dragon.
361,"What do you pray for, Ser Jorah?",Home.
362,Lover's quarrel?,I'm sorry. Do I...?
363,I'm sorry. Do I...?,"Sansa dear, this is Lord Baelish. He's known..."
364,Why do they call you Littlefinger?,Arya!
365,"Gods, who is that?",Ser Gregor Clegane. They call him the Mountain. The Houndo s older brother.
366,And his opponent?,Ser Hugh of the Vale. He was Jon Arryn's squire. Look how far he's come.
367,"Not what you were expecting? Has anyone ever told you the story of the Mountain and the Hound? Lovely little tale of brotherly love. The Hound was just a pup, six years old maybe. Gregor a few years older, already a big lad, already getting a bit of a reputation. Some lucky boys just born with a talent for violence. One evening... Gregor found his little brother playing with a toy by the fire... Gregor's toy, a wooden knight. Gregor never said a word, he just grabbed his brother by the scruff of his neck and shoved his face into the burning coals. Held him there while the boy screamed, while his face melted. There aren't very many people who know that story.",I won't tell anyone. I promise.
368,I thought we might put what happened on the Kingsroad behind us – the ugliness with the wolves. And forcing you to kill the beast was extreme. Though sometimes we go to extremes where our children are concerned. How is Sansa?,She likes it here.
369,What are you doing here?,I might ask the same of you. What is it you hope to accomplish?
370,I might ask the same of you. What is it you hope to accomplish?,"The King called on me to serve him and the realm, and that's what I'll do until he tells me otherwise."
371,"You're just a soldier, aren't you? You take your orders and you carry on. I suppose it makes sense. Your older brother was trained to lead and you were trained to follow.","I was also trained to kill my enemies, Your Grace."
372,"Good idea, grandfather. I'm starving. A song while we wait or?",I'd rather throw myself down a well.
373,Is there nothing I can do... to remedy this?,You can have my room.
374,"There's a clever man. You can manage food, I trust? Yoren, dine with me.","Aye, my Lord."
375,My Lord of Lannister! Might I entertain you while you eat? I can sing of your father's victory at King's Landing!,Nothing would more likely ruin my supper. Lady Stark! What an unexpected pleasure. I was sorry to have missed you at Winterfell.
376,"I was still Catelyn Tully the last time I stayed here. You, Ser... Is that the black bat of Harrenhal I see embroidered on your coat?","It is, my Lady."
377,And is Lady Whent a true and honest friend to my father... Lord Hoster Tully of Riverrun?,She is.
378,Does Ser Hugh have any family in the capital?,No. I stood vigil for him myself last night. He had no one else.
379,Who determines the draw?,"All the knights draw straws, Lord Stark."
380,"Aye... But who holds the straws? You've done good work, Sisters.",Life is strange. Not so many years ago we fought as enemies at the Trident.
381,And that lad... He was a squire until a few months ago. How could he afford a new suit of armor?,Perhaps Lord Arryn left him some money? I hear the King wants to joust today.
382,Perhaps Lord Arryn left him some money? I hear the King wants to joust today.,Yes. That will never happen.
383,Your mother was a dumb whore with a fat arse. Did you know that? Look at this idiot! One ball and no brains. He can't even put a man's armor on him properly.,You're too fat for your armor.
384,"Fat? Fat, is it? Is that how you speak to your King? That was funny, is it?","Oh, it's funny, is it?"
385,"Oh, it's funny, is it?","No, Your Grace."
386,No? You don't like the Hando s joke?,You're torturing the poor boy.
387,The breastplate stretcher?,How long before he figures it out?
388,How long before he figures it out?,Maybe you should have one invented.
389,Why? Because I'm king? Piss on that. I want to hit somebody!,And who's going to hit you back?
390,And who's going to hit you back?,Anybody who can. And the last man in his saddle... will be you!
391,Are you telling me those cowards would let me win?,Aye.
392,Your squire... A Lannister boy?,"Hmm... A bloody idiot... But Cersei insisted. I have Jon Arryn to thank for her. ""Cersei Lannister will make a good match"", he told me. ""You'll need her father on your side."" I thought being King meant I could do whatever I wanted. Enough of this! Let's go watch 'em ride. At least I can smell someone else's blood."
393,Robert?,"What? Oh! An inspiring sight for the people, eh? Come! Bow before your King! Bow, you shits!"
394,"What? Oh! An inspiring sight for the people, eh? Come! Bow before your King! Bow, you shits!",Where's Arya
395,Now what will I buy with 100 gold dragons? A dozen barrels of Dornish wine? Or a girl from the pleasure houses of Lys?,Or you could even buy a friend.
396,"And tell me, Lord Renly, when will you be having your friend?","Loras knew his mare was in heat. Quite crafty, really."
397,"Very wise. They'll be out in droves, looking for me in the wrong place. Wordo s probably gotten to my father by now. He'll be offering a handsome reward. Everyone knows a Lannister always pays his debts. Would you be so good as to untie me?",And why would I do that?
398,And why would I do that?,Why not? Am I going to run? The hill tribes would kill me for my boots. Unless a Shadowcat ate me first.
399,Why not? Am I going to run? The hill tribes would kill me for my boots. Unless a Shadowcat ate me first.,Shadowcats and hill tribes are the least of your concerns.
400,"Ah... the Eastern Road. We're going to The Vale. You're taking me to your sister's to answer for my imagined crimes. Tell me, Lady Stark. When was the last time you saw your sister?",Five years ago.
401,What sort of imbecile arms an assassin with his own blade?,Should I gag him?
402,Should I gag him?,Why? Am I starting to make sense?
403,Why? Am I starting to make sense?,"My Lady, this way."
404,"Untie me. If I die, what's the point?",Rodrik?
405,Rodrik?,"I'll be fine, my Lady. There's no need to bloody yourself."
406,Your first? You need a woman. Nothing like a woman after a fight.,"Well, I'm willing if she is."
407,Lords?,The Greyjoys.
408,Those are Tully words... Your mother's. Are we playing a game?,"Family, duty, honor""... Is that the right order?"
409,"Family, duty, honor""... Is that the right order?",You know it is.
410,Family comes first?,Your mother had to leave Winterfell to protect the family.
411,"How can she protect the family, if she's not with her family?",Your mother sat by your bed for three weeks while you slept.
412,Why did she leave?,"I still can't tell you, but she will be home soon."
413,Do you know where she is now? Today?,"No, I don't."
414,Then how can you promise me she'll be home soon?,Sometimes I worry you're too smart for your own good.
415,And where is that written?,You need legs to work a bow.
416,Really?,Dothraki boys learn when they're four years old. Why shouldn't you?
417,Dothraki boys learn when they're four years old. Why shouldn't you?,Shh... Keep it down. You're not supposed to be inside the castle walls.
418,Who? the Imp? I'd call him half a nobleman.,Jealous?
419,Jealous?,Why should I be jealous?
420,Why should I be jealous?,Anyone with a few coppers in his pocket can own you for the night. What's a dwarf like down below? I've always wondered.
421,Anyone with a few coppers in his pocket can own you for the night. What's a dwarf like down below? I've always wondered.,Might surprise you.
422,Hmm?,He's good with his fingers too. And his tongue.
423,And what about the Starks?,I've been Lord Stark's ward since I was eight years old.
424,My father fought for the freedom of his people! What did your father do? Fucked a cook and whelped a whore.,You're a very serious boy.
425,"How is your son, my Lord?",He'll never walk again.
426,But his mind is sound?,So they say.
427,A blessing then. I suffered an early mutilation myself. Some doors close forever... others open in the most unexpected places. May I?,"If the wrong ears heard what I'm about to tell you, off comes my head. And who would mourn poor Varys then? North or South, they sing no songs for spiders. But there are things you must know. You are the King's Hand and the King is a fool... your friend, I know, but a fool... and doomed unless you save him."
428,"If the wrong ears heard what I'm about to tell you, off comes my head. And who would mourn poor Varys then? North or South, they sing no songs for spiders. But there are things you must know. You are the King's Hand and the King is a fool... your friend, I know, but a fool... and doomed unless you save him.",I've been in the capital a month. Why have you waited so long to tell me this?
429,I've been in the capital a month. Why have you waited so long to tell me this?,I didn't trust you.
430,So why do you trust me now?,"The Queen is not the only one who has been watching you closely. There are few men of honor in the capital. You are one of them. I would like to believe I am another, strange as that may seem."
431,What sort of doom does the King face?,"The same sort as Jon Arryn. The tears of Lys, they call it. A rare and costly thing, as clear and tasteless as water. It leaves no trace."
432,Who gave it to him?,"Some dear friend, no doubt. But which one? There were many. Lord Arryn was a kind and trusting man. There was one boy... all he was he owed to Jon Arryn."
433,"Some dear friend, no doubt. But which one? There were many. Lord Arryn was a kind and trusting man. There was one boy... all he was he owed to Jon Arryn.","The squire, Ser Hugh?"
434,"The squire, Ser Hugh?","Pity what happened to him, just when his life seemed to be going so nicely."
435,"If Ser Hugh poisoned him, who paid Ser Hugh?",Someone who could afford it.
436,Jon was a man of peace. He was Hand for 17 years -- 17 good years. Why kill him?,He started asking questions.
437,"And when he knows the truth, what will he do?","The gods alone know. The fools tried to kill his son. What's worse, they botched it. The wolf and the lion will be at each other's throats. We will be at war soon, my friend."
438,"What good is war now? We're not ready. If one Hand can die, why not a second?",This Hand is not the other.
439,"Am I? All those birds that whisper in your ear, such pretty little things. Trust me, we accommodate all inclinations.","Oh, I'm sure. Lord Redwyne likes his boys very young, I hear."
440,"Though I suppose beauty is a subjective quality, no? Is it true that Ser Marlon of Tumblestone prefers amputees?",All desires are valid to a man with a full purse.
441,"Tell me. Does someone, somewhere, keep your balls in a little box? I've often wondered.","Do you know, I have no idea where they are? And we had been so close. But enough about me. How have you been since we last saw each other?"
442,"Do you know, I have no idea where they are? And we had been so close. But enough about me. How have you been since we last saw each other?",Since you last saw me or since I last saw you?
443,Since you last saw me or since I last saw you?,"Now the last time I saw you, you were talking to the Hand of the King."
444,Saw me with your own eyes?,Eyes I own.
445,But you know something? I do believe that I have seen you even more recently than you have seen me.,Have you?
446,Have you?,"Yes. Earlier today, I distinctly recall seeing you talking to Lord Stark in his chambers."
447,Was that you under the bed?,"And not long after that when I saw you escorting a certain foreign dignitary... Council business? Of course you would have friends from across The Narrow Sea. You're from there yourself, after all. We're friends, aren't we, Lord Varys? I'd like to think we are. So you can imagine my burden, wondering if the King might question my friendo s sympathies… To stand at a crossroads where turning left means loyalty to a friend, turning right, loyalty to the realm."
448,"And not long after that when I saw you escorting a certain foreign dignitary... Council business? Of course you would have friends from across The Narrow Sea. You're from there yourself, after all. We're friends, aren't we, Lord Varys? I'd like to think we are. So you can imagine my burden, wondering if the King might question my friendo s sympathies… To stand at a crossroads where turning left means loyalty to a friend, turning right, loyalty to the realm.","Oh, please."
449,"What are you two conspiring about? Well, whatever it is, you'd best hurry up. My brother is coming.",To a small council meeting?
450,To a small council meeting?,Disturbing news from far away. Haven't you heard?
451,Disturbing news from far away. Haven't you heard?,Off with you. No begging.
452,D'you want a smack on your ear to help you with your hearing?,I want to see my father.
453,"You want your father, boy? He's lying on the floor of some tavern, getting pissed on by his friends.","My father is Hand of the King! I'm not a boy. I'm Arya Stark of Winterfell and if you lay a hand on me, my father will have both your heads on spikes! Now are you going to let me by or do I need to smack you on the ear to help with your hearing?"
454,"My father is Hand of the King! I'm not a boy. I'm Arya Stark of Winterfell and if you lay a hand on me, my father will have both your heads on spikes! Now are you going to let me by or do I need to smack you on the ear to help with your hearing?",You know I had half my guard out searching for you? You promised me this would stop.
455,You know I had half my guard out searching for you? You promised me this would stop.,They said they were going to kill you.
456,Who did?,"I didn't see them, but I think one was fat."
457,Where did you hear this?,"In the dungeons, near the dragon skulls."
458,What were you doing in the dungeons?,Chasing a cat.
459,"Your name, friend?","Yoren, if it please. This must be your son. He has the look."
460,Did Benjen send you?,"No one sent me, my Lord. I'm here to find men for The Wall, see if there's any scum in the dungeons that might be fit for service."
461,Know what?,"Best said in private, my Lord."
462,How many guards does my father have?,Here in King's Landing? Fifty.
463,Here in King's Landing? Fifty.,"You wouldn't let anyone kill him, would you?"
464,"You wouldn't let anyone kill him, would you?","No fear on that count, little Lady."
465,Well?,"It's about your wife, my Lord. She's taken the Imp."
466,To whom do I speak?,"Ser Vardis Egen, Knight of The Vale. Is Lady Arryn expecting your visit?"
467,"Ser Vardis Egen, Knight of The Vale. Is Lady Arryn expecting your visit?",There was no time to send word.
468,"May I ask, my Lady, why he is with you?",That's why there was no time. He is my prisoner.
469,Is it about my wife?,"No, my Lord. I believe it concerns Daenerys Targaryen."
470,"I warned you this would happen. Back in the North, I warned you, but you didn't care to hear. Well, hear it now. I want 'em dead, mother and child both. And that fool, Viserys as well. Is that plain enough for you? I want them both dead.",You will dishonor yourself forever if you do this.
471,"Honor?! I've got Seven Kingdoms to rule! One King, Seven Kingdoms. Do you think honor keeps them in line? Do you think it's honor that's keeping the peace? It's fear! Fear and blood!",Then we're no better than the Mad King.
472,You want to assassinate a girl... Because the Spider heard a rumor?,"No rumor, my Lord. The princess is with child."
473,Based on whose information?,Ser Jorah Mormont. He is serving as adviser to the Targaryens.
474,Mormont? You bring us the whispers of a traitor half a world away and call it fact?,"Jorah Mormont's a slaver, not a traitor. Small difference, I know, to an honorable man."
475,"He broke the law, betrayed his family, fled our land. We commit murder on the word of this man?",And if he's right? If she has a son? A Targaryen at the head of a Dothraki army… What then?
476,And if he's right? If she has a son? A Targaryen at the head of a Dothraki army… What then?,The Narrow Sea still lies between us. I'll fear the Dothraki the day they teach their horses to run on water.
477,Do nothing? That's your wise advice? Do nothing til our enemies are on our shores? You're my council? Counsel! Speak sense to this honorable fool.,"I understand your misgivings, my Lord. Truly, I do. It is a terrible thing we must consider, a vile thing. Yet, we who presume to rule must sometimes do vile things for the good of the realm. Should the gods grant Daenerys a son, the realm will bleed."
478,"I bear this girl no ill will, but should the Dothraki invade, how many innocents will die? How many towns will burn? Is it not wiser, kinder even, that she should die now so that tens of thousands might live?",We should have had them both killed years ago.
479,"Out! Out, damn you! I'm done with you. Go! Run back to Winterfell! I'll have your head on a spike! I'll put it there myself, you fool! You think you're too good for this? Too proud and honorable? This is a war!",I'll go ahead with my daughters. Get them ready. Do it yourself. Don't ask anyone for help.
480,What can I do for you?,When do you return to Winterfell?
481,When do you return to Winterfell?,Why? What do you care?
482,Why? What do you care?,"If you're still here come nightfall, I'll take you to see the last person Jon Arryn spoke with before falling ill. If that sort of thing still interests you."
483,Round up all the men we have and station them outside the girls' chambers. Who are your best two swords?,Heward and Wyl.
484,"You bring him here without permission? You pollute my home with his presence? Your aunt has done a bad thing, Robin, a very bad thing. You remember her, don't you? Isn't he beautiful? And strong too. Jon knew it. His last words were, ""the seed is strong."" He wanted everyone to know what a good, strong boy his son would grow up to be. Look at him, the Lord of all the Vale.","Lysa, you wrote me about the Lannisters, warning me t-"
485,Mommy? Is that the bad man?,It is.
486,Oh? Did I kill him too? I've been a very busy man.,You will watch your tongue! These men are Knights of the Vale. Every one of the loved Jon Arryn. Every one of them would die for me.
487,Are you sure this won't hurt?,Only if I slip.
488,And you prefer me like this?,Mhmm.
489,"My brother thinks that anyone who hasn't been to war isn't a man. He treats me as if I'm a spoiled child. Oh, and you're not? Loras Tyrell, the Knight of the Flowers? How many wars have you fought in? Oh, and how much did your father spend on that armor of yours?",Hold still.
490,Everywhere?,Everywhere. So how did it end up? The Targaryen girl will die?
491,Everywhere. So how did it end up? The Targaryen girl will die?,"It needs to be done, unpleasant as it is. Robert's rather tasteless about it. Every time he talks about killing her, I swear the table rises six inches."
492,Hmm... How did that ever happen?,Because he loves his killing and he used to be good at it.
493,Do you know who should be King?,Be serious.
494,And where was Robert in the line of royal succession? Joffrey is a monster. Tommen is eight.,Stannis?
495,Stannis?,Stannis has the personality of a lobster.
496,What are you doing?!,Look at it.
497,"You're willing to do what needs to be done, but you don't gloat over it. You don't love killing. Where is it written that power is the sole province of the worst? That thrones are only made for the hated and the feared. You would be a wonderful King.",I'm sorry your marriage to Ned Stark didn't work out. You seemed so good together.
498,No. He's not serious enough. I'll say this for Ned Stark - he's serious enough. Was it really worth it? Losing him this way?,"I don't know. But I do know this, if the Targaryen girl convinces her horse-lord husband to invade and the Dothraki horde crosses The Narrow Sea... We won't be able to stop them."
499,Is my father wrong?,"Let's say Viserys Targaryen lands with forty thousand Dothraki screamers at his back. We hole up in our castles, a wise move. Only a fool would meet the Dothraki in an open field. They leave us in our castles. They go from town to town, looting and burning, killing every man who can't hide behind a stone wall, stealing all our crops and livestock, enslaving all our women and children. How long do the people of the Seven Kingdoms stand behind their absentee King, their cowardly King hiding behind high walls? When do the people decide that Viserys Targaryen is the rightful monarch after all."
500,"Let's say Viserys Targaryen lands with forty thousand Dothraki screamers at his back. We hole up in our castles, a wise move. Only a fool would meet the Dothraki in an open field.

When do the people decide that Viserys Targaryen is the rightful monarch after all.",We still outnumber them.
501,Which is the bigger number -- five or one?,Five.
502,What do you want?,"We haven't had a real fight in nine years. Back-stabbing doesn't prepare you for a fight. And that's all the realm is now, back-stabbing and scheming and arse-licking and money-grubbing. Sometimes I don't know what holds it together."
503,"Ah, so here we sit, seventeen years later, holding it all together. Don't you get tired?",Every day.
504,How long can hate hold a thing together?,"Well, seventeen years is quite a long time."
505,"Yes, it tis. What was she like?","You've never asked about her, not once. Why not?"
506,"You've never asked about her, not once. Why not?","At first, just saying her name, even in private felt like I was breathing life back into her. I thought if I didn't talk about her, she'd just fade away for you. When I realized that wasn't going to happen, I refused to ask out of spite. I didn't want to give you the satisfaction of thinking I cared enough to ask. And eventually it became clear that my spite didn't mean anything to you, as far as I could tell, you actually enjoyed it."
507,So why now?,What harm could Lyanna Stark's ghost do to either of us that we haven't done to each other a hundred times over?
508,What harm could Lyanna Stark's ghost do to either of us that we haven't done to each other a hundred times over?,"You want to know the horrible truth? I can't even remember what she looked like. I only know she was the one thing I ever wanted... Someone took her away from me, and Seven Kingdoms couldn't fill the hole she left behind."
509,"You want to know the horrible truth? I can't even remember what she looked like. I only know she was the one thing I ever wanted... Someone took her away from me, and Seven Kingdoms couldn't fill the hole she left behind.","I felt something for you once, you know?"
510,"I felt something for you once, you know?",I know.
511,"Even after we lost our first boy -- for quite a while, actually. Was it ever possible for us? Was there ever a time, ever a... moment?",No. Does that make you feel better or worse?
512,No. Does that make you feel better or worse?,It doesn't make me feel anything.
513,"She looks like him, don't she, my Lord? She has his nose, his black hair.","Tell him when you see him, my Lord. If it please you... Tell him how beautiful she is."
514,"When Jon Arryn came to visit you, what did he want?","He wasn't that sort of man, my Lord. He just wanted to know if the child was happy, healthy."
515,What do you know of King Robert's bastards?,"Well, he has more than you, for a start."
516,How many?,"Does it matter? If you fuck enough women, some of them will give you presents."
517,"Does it matter? If you fuck enough women, some of them will give you presents.",And Jon Arryn tracked them all down. Why?
518,And Jon Arryn tracked them all down. Why?,He was the King's Hand. Perhaps Robert wanted them looked after. He was overcome with fatherly love.
519,"What's the meaning of this, Lannister?","Get back inside where it's safe. I'm looking for my brother. You remember my brother, don't you, Lord Stark? Blond hair, sharp tongue, short man."
520,"Get back inside where it's safe. I'm looking for my brother. You remember my brother, don't you, Lord Stark? Blond hair, sharp tongue, short man.",I remember him well.
521,"It seems he had some trouble on the road. You wouldn't know what happened to him, would you?",He was taken at my command to answer for his crimes.
522,"Threaten? As in, ""I'm going to open your Lord from balls to brains and see what Starks are made of”?","You kill me, your brother's a dead man."
523,Do you know what your wife has done?,She did nothing I did not command.
524,Who'd have thought she had it in her?,By what right dare you lay hands on my blood?
525,By what right dare you lay hands on my blood?,I am the King's Hand -
526,"Oh, will both of you shut your mouths? Catelyn will release Tyrion and you'll make your peace with Jaime.",He butchered my men.
527,See what she does to me? My loving wife. I should not have hit her. That was not… That was not kingly.,If we don't act… there will be a war.
528,"So tell your wife to return that little shit of an Imp to King's Landing. She's had her fun, now put an end to it. You hear me? Send a raven and put an end to it.",And what about Jaime Lannister? What about Jaime?
529,And what about Jaime Lannister? What about Jaime?,"I'm half a kingdom in debt to his bloody father. I don't know what happened between you and those yellow-haired shits. I don't want to know. This is what matters - I can't rule the kingdoms if the Starks and the Lannisters are at each other's throats, so enough!"
530,The hunt?,Killing things clears my head. You'll have to sit on the throne while I'm away. You'll hate it more than I do.
531,Khaleesi?,"Oh, Khaleesi!"
532,When are you gonna tell him?,Not now.
533,You want me to march on Casterly Rock?!,You're not a boy anymore. They attacked your father. They've already started the war. It's your duty to represent your House when your father can't.
534,Where's Bran?,I don't know. It's not my House.
535,Robb?,All alone in the deep dark woods.
536,I don't see him. Got him hidden under your cloak?,"Oh, that's a pretty pin. Silver."
537,What's wrong with you? You some kind of cripple?,"I'm Brandon Stark of Winterfell and if you don't let me be, I'll have you all killed!"
538,Are you all right?,"Yes, it doesn't hurt."
539,Have you lost your mind? What if you'd missed?,He would have killed you and cut Bran's throat.
540,"To what, to save your brother's life? It was the only thing to do, so I did it.",What about her?
541,What about her?,"Give me my life, my lord, and I'm yours."
542,How would you like to be rich?,Dwarf man still making noise.
543,No?,They killed Jory. My father is hurt. I don't care about stupid wooden swords.
544,"More trouble for you. Just so… How can you be quick as a snake, or as quiet as a shadow, when you are somewhere else? You are fearing for your father, hmm? That is right. Do you pray to the gods?",The old and the new.
545,She has to eat a whole heart? I hope that wasn't my horse.,She's doing well.
546,"I need a large army… I'm the last hope of a dynasty, Mormont. The greatest dynasty this world has ever seen, on my shoulders since I was five years old and no one has ever given me what they gave to her in that tent. Never. Not a piece of it… How can I carry what I need to carry without it? Hmm? Who can rule without wealth, or fear, or love? Oh, you stand there, all nobility and honor. You don't think I see you looking at my little sister, hmm? Don't think I know what you want? I don't care. You can have her. She can be queen of the savages and dine on the finest bloody horseparts, and you can dine on whichever parts of her you like. But let me go.","You can go, but you can't have the eggs."
547,You swore an oath to me. Does loyalty mean nothing to you?,It means everything to me.
548,And yet here you stand?,And here I stand.
549,Where?,"Where? I don't know where, but when they free me -"
550,"Where? I don't know where, but when they free me -",You want free? Go be free.
551,You want free? Go be free.,"Have you ever heard the phrase “Rich as a Lannister”? Of course you have. You're a smart man. You know who the Lannisters are. I am a Lannister. Tyrion, son of Tywin! And of course, you have also heard the phrase, “a Lannister always pays his debts.” If you deliver a message from me to Lady Arryn, I will be in your debt. I will owe you gold. If you deliver the message and I live, which I very much intend to do."

If you deliver the message and I live, which I very much intend to do.",What message?
553,What message?,Tell her I wish to confess my crimes.
554,You wish to confess your crimes?,"Yes, my lady. I do, my lady."
555,"Where do I begin, my lords and ladies? I'm a vile man, I confess it. My crimes and sins are beyond counting. I have lied and cheated, gambled and whored. I'm not particularly good at violence, but I'm good at convincing others to do violence for me. You want specifics, I suppose. When I was seven, I saw a servant girl bathing in the river. I stole her robe. She was forced to return to the castle, naked and in tears. I close my eyes, I can still see her tits bouncing. When I was ten, I stuffed my uncle's boots with goatshit. When confronted with my crime, I blamed a squire. Poor boy was flogged and… I escaped justice. When I was twelve, I milked my eel into a pot of turtle stew. I flogged the one-eyed snake. I skinned my sausage. I made the bald man cry into the turtle stew, which I do believe my sister ate. At least I hope she did. I once brought a jackass and a honeycomb into a brothel -",Silence!
556,What happened next?!,What do you think you're doing?
557,What do you think you're doing?,Confessing my crimes.
558,"Is this how justice is done in the Vale? you accuse me of crimes, I deny them, so you throw me in a cell to freeze and starve? Where is the King's Justice? I'm accused and demand a trial.","If you're tried and found guilty, then by the king's own laws you will pay with your life."
559,Ser Vardis… You're quiet. Did you want to avenge my husband?,"With all my heart, my Lady. But the Imp is half my size. It would be shameful to slaughter such a man and call it justice."

689,Robb? He's just a boy.,Boys have been conquerors before. But the man giving Cersei sleepless nights is the king's the late king's brother. Lord Stannis has the best claim to the throne. He is a proven battle commander and he is utterly without mercy.
690,"You want me to serve the woman who murdered my king, who butchered my men, who crippled my son?","l want you to serve the realm! Tell the queen you will confess your vile treason, tell your son to lay down his sword and proclaim Joffrey as the true heir. Cersei knows you as a man of honor. lf you give her the peace she needs, and promise to carry her secret to your grave, l believe she will allow you to take the black and live out your days on the Wall with your brother and your bastard son."

707,What is it?,l - l can't.
708,You can't what?,l'm really not supposed to say.

721,"Then Lord Stark is one man in 10,000. Most of us are not so strong. What is honor compared to a woman's love? And what is duty against the feel of a newborn son in your arms? Or a brother's smile?",Sam told you.
722,And this is my day? ls that what you're saying?,"Oh, it hurts, boy. Oh, yes. l know."
723,Who are you?,"My father was Maekar, the first of his name. My brother Aegon reigned after him when l had refused the throne. And he was followed by his son Aerys whom they called the Mad King."

756,How did you hear that?,You hear lots of things playing dice with Lannister soldiers.
757,"Not quite. First, my father had Jaime tell me the truth. The girl was a whore, you see. Jaime had arranged the whole thing - the road, the rapers, all of it. He thought it was time l had a woman. After my brother confessed, my father brought in my wife and gave her to his guards. He paid her well - a silver for each man. How many whores command that kind of price? He brought me into the barracks and made me watch. By the end, she had so much silver that the coins were slipping through her fingers and rolling on to the floor.",l would have killed the man who did that to me.

782,Saw him when?,"Last night, when l was sleeping. Here, Shaggydog."
783,Very amusing. lsn't it a funny song? Thank you for your rendition. l imagine it was even better received at that tavern.,"l'm so sorry, Your Grace. l'll never sing it again, l swear."
784,"Tell me, which do you favor - your fingers or your tongue?",Your Grace?
785,Your Grace?,"Fingers or your tongue? lf you got to keep one, which would it be? Or l could just cut your throat."
786,"Fingers or your tongue? lf you got to keep one, which would it be? Or l could just cut your throat.","Every man needs hands, Your Grace."
787,"Ser llyn, who better than you to carry out the sentence?","l beg you! Please, no. No!"
788,Well?,How long do l have to look?
789,How long do l have to look?,As long as it pleases me. Do you want to see the rest?
790,As long as it pleases me. Do you want to see the rest?,lf it please Your Grace.
791,Will you obey now? Or do you need another lesson? l'll look for you in court.,"Save yourself some pain, girl. Give him what he wants."
792,Do you mean to declare us for Stannis?,Renly is not right! lf we put ourselves behind Stannis…
793,"My Lords. My Lords! Here is what l say to these two kings. Renly Baratheon is nothing to me, nor Stannis neither. Why should they rule over me and mine from some flowery seat in the South? What do they know of the Wall or the Wolfswood? Even their gods are wrong! Why shouldn't we rule ourselves again? lt was the dragons we bowed to and now the dragons are dead! There sits the only king l mean to bend my knee to - the King in the North!",l'll have peace on those terms. They can keep their Red Castle and their iron chair too. The King in the North!
794,"Am l your brother, now and always?",Now and always.
795,"You look lovely tonight, Lady Stark. Widowhood becomes you. Your bed must be lonely. ls that why you came? l'm not at my best, but l think l could be of service. You slip out of that gown and we'll see if l'm up to it. Oh, l do like a violent woman.","l will kill you tonight, Ser. Pack your head in a box and send it to your sister."
796,"That is what you want the world to believe, isn't it? That you don't fear death.","But l don't, my lady. The dark is coming for all of us. Why cry about it?"
797,"But l don't, my lady. The dark is coming for all of us. Why cry about it?","Because you are going to the deepest of the seven hells, if the gods are just."
798,What gods are those? The trees your husband prayed to? Where were the trees when his head was getting chopped off? lf your gods are real and if they are just why is the world so full of injustice?,Because of men like you.
799,My son Bran. How did he come to fall from that tower?,l pushed him out the window.
800,Why?,I hoped the fall would kill him.
801,"l can't believe we're actually at war. Was it this exciting last time, when you were young? What does it say? Have we captured Robb Stark yet? What's our next move?",Stop talking. Get back into bed.
802,ls it true about Stannis and Renly?,"Both Baratheon brothers have taken up against us. Jaime captured, his armies scattered. lt's a catastrophe. Perhaps we should sue for peace."
803,And do what?,"Rule. You will serve as Hand of the King in my stead. You will bring that boy king to heel, and his mother too, if needs be. And if you get so much as a whiff of treason from any of the rest – Baelish, Varys, Pycelle…"
804,"Heads, spikes, walls. Why not my uncle? Why not anyone? Why me?","You're my son. Oh, one more thing. You will not take that whore to court. Do you understand?"
805,"You're my son. Oh, one more thing. You will not take that whore to court. Do you understand?",Ser Jorah?
806,Ser Jorah?,"Gently, gently."
807,My son – where is he? l want him. Where is he?,The boy did not live.
808,What is there to tell?,How did my son die?
809,How did my son die?,"He never lived, my princess. The women say –"
810,What do the women say?,They say the child was –
811,Where is Khal Drogo? Show him to me. Show me what l bought with my son's life.,"As you command, lady. Come. l will take you to him."
812,Drogo! My sun and stars. Why is he out here alone?,"He seems to like the warmth, Princess."
813,This is not life. When will he be as he was?,"When the sun rises in the west, sets in the east. When the seas go dry. When the mountains blow in the wind like leaves."
814,lnnocent? He would have been The Stallion Who Mounts The World. Now he will burn no cities. Now his khalasar will trample no nations into dust.,l spoke for you. l saved you.
815,"Saved me? Three of those riders had already raped me before you saved me, girl. l saw my godo s house burn, there where l had healed men and women beyond counting. ln the streets l saw piles of heads, the head of the baker who makes my bread, the head of a young boy that l had cured of fever just three moons past. So tell me again exactly what it was that you saved?",Your life.
816,They'll put out the word. They'll send out ravens. People will come after you. Do you know what happens to deserters?,Better than you do.
817,What are you going to do?,l'm gonna find my brother and put a sword through King Joffrey's throat.
818,Hand of the King?,So it would seem.
819,And your father said you couldn't take anyone with you to King's Landing?,"No, he said l couldn't take with me to King's Landing. He was very specific on that point."
820,He knew my name?,What?
821,What?,"He said, ""Don't bring Shae with you to King's Landing""?"
822,"He said, ""Don't bring Shae with you to King's Landing""?","l believe he used the word ""whore""."
823,Are you ashamed of me? Are you afraid that l'm dancing around the court with my tits out?,"I'm funny now? l'm Shae, the funny whore."
824,"I'm funny now? l'm Shae, the funny whore.","My father's probably the most powerful man in the country. Certainly the richest. He has all Seven Kingdoms in his pockets. Everyone everywhere always has to do exactly what my father says. He's always been a cunt. l believe the ladies of the court could learn a great deal from a girl like you. Why don't you come with me, be the Hando s lady? Because the King needs a Hand and the Hand –"
825,"My father's probably the most powerful man in the country. Certainly the richest. He has all Seven Kingdoms in his pockets. Everyone everywhere always has to do exactly what my father says. He's always been a cunt. l believe the ladies of the court could learn a great deal from a girl like you. Why don't you come with me, be the Hando s lady? Because the King needs a Hand and the Hand –",l know what a Hand needs.
826,Ghost?,Hyah! Hyah! Hyah! Hyah!
827,ls he dead?,"No, he's not dead."
828,Did we get him?,"Come on, help me get him up."
829,"Do you remember our first ride, my sun and stars? lf you are in there, if you haven't gone away, show me. You're a fighter. You've always been a fighter. l need you to fight now. l know you're very far away, but come back to me, my sun and stars.","When the sun rises in the west and sets in the east. Then you shall return to me, my sun and stars."
830,"Kings? Oh, l can tell you all there is to know about kings. The thing you need to understand about kings is – For the past 67 years, l've known truly known more kings than any man alive. They're complicated men, but l know how to serve them. Yes, and keep on serving them. Aerys Targaryen. Of all the thousand thousand maladies the Gods visit on us, madness is the worst. He was a good man. Such a charmer. To watch him melt away before my eyes, consumed by dreams of fire and blood. Robert Baratheon was an entirely different animal – powerful man, great warrior, but alas - winning a kingdom and ruling a kingdom are rather different things. They say that if a man goes through life with his battle visor down, he can often be blind to the enemies at his side. Now l serve his son King Joffrey, may the Gods bless his reign.","He is a capable young man. Strong military mind. Stern. But sternness in defense of the realm is no vice. lt's far too soon to know what manner of king he will be, but l sense true greatness on the horizon for our new King. Mmm. True greatness."
831,So what's the thing?,What thing?
832,What thing?,"About kings. You said, ""The thing you need to understand about kings""."
833,What? Things? What?,"When you started, you… Never mind."
834,"When you imagine yourself up there, how do you look? Does the crown fit? Do all the lords and ladies simper and bow, the ones who sneered at you for years?",lt's hard for them to simper and bow without heads.
835,"And what would you do, my friend, if you found yourself sitting up there?",l must be one of the few men in this city who doesn't want to be King.
836,"When they castrated you, did they take the pillar with the stones? l've always wondered.",Have you? Do you spend a lot of time wondering what's between my legs?
837,Have you? Do you spend a lot of time wondering what's between my legs?,l picture a gash. Like a woman's. ls that about right?
838,l picture a gash. Like a woman's. ls that about right?,"l am flattered, of course, to be pictured at all."
839,Am l? That is good to know. Do you lie awake at night fearing my gash?,But you carry on whispering in one king's ear and then the next. l admire you.
840,My lords. Shall we begin?,"You're Arry now, hear me? Arry the orphan boy. No one asks an orphan too many questions, ‘cause nobody gives three shits. What's your name?"
841,"You're Arry now, hear me? Arry the orphan boy. No one asks an orphan too many questions, ‘cause nobody gives three shits. What's your name?",Arry.
842,What's a gutter rat like you doing with a sword?,Maybe he's a little squire.
843,You want it? l'll give it to you. l already killed one fat boy. l bet you never killed anyone. l bet you're a liar. But l'm not. l'm good at killing fat boys. l like killing fat boys.,"Your like picking on the little ones, do you? l've been hammering an anvil these past 10 years. When l hit that steel, it sings. Are you gonna sing when l hit you? This is castle-forged steel. Where'd you steal it?"
844,"Your like picking on the little ones, do you? l've been hammering an anvil these past 10 years. When l hit that steel, it sings. Are you gonna sing when l hit you? This is castle-forged steel. Where'd you steal it?",lt was a gift.
845,Which are you?,"Armourer's apprentice. But my master got sick of me, so here l am."
846,Ham. How many days in a row must a man be expected to start his day with ham? Bring me some beer at least. You look exhausted. Was your moonlight ride that tiring?,My friends brought me back.
847,"And you're gonna bring him back to life, are you? No? Good. We've had enough of that sort of thing. Beyond the Wall, the Rangers are reporting whole villages abandoned. At night they see fires blazing in the mountains from dusk until dawn. A captured wildling swears their tribes are uniting in some secret stronghold, to what ends the gods only know. Outside Eastwatch Cotter Pyke's men discovered four blue-eyed corpses. Unlike us, they were wise enough to burn them. Do you think your brother's war is more important than ours?",No.
848,"When dead men and worse come hunting for us in the night, do you think it matters who sits on the lron Throne?",Good. Because l want you and your wolf with us when we ride out beyond the Wall tomorrow.
849,Beyond the Wall?,"l'll not sit meekly by and wait for the snows. l mean to find out what's happening. The Night's Watch will ride in force against the wildlings, the White Walkers and whatever else is out there. And we will find Benjen Stark, alive or dead. l will command them myself. So l'll only ask you once, Lord Snow, are you a brother of the Night's Watch or a bastard boy who wants to play at war?"
850,"l'll not sit meekly by and wait for the snows. l mean to find out what's happening. The Night's Watch will ride in force against the wildlings, the White Walkers and whatever else is out there. And we will find Benjen Stark, alive or dead. l will command them myself. So l'll only ask you once, Lord Snow, are you a brother of the Night's Watch or a bastard boy who wants to play at war?","ls this your command, Khaleesi?"
851,"ls this your command, Khaleesi?",Drogo will have no use for dragon eggs in the Night Lands. Sell them. You can return to the Free Cities and live as a wealthy woman for all your days.
852,"ls that what you fear? You will be my khalasar. l see the faces of slaves. l free you. Take off your collars. Go if you wish, no one will stop you. But if you stay it will be as brothers and sisters, as husbands and wives.","Ser Jorah, bind this woman to the pyre. You swore to obey me."
853,Did you like that?,"It was well struck, Your Grace."
854,Who's next?,"Lothor Brune, freerider in the service of Lord Baelish."
855,Are you drunk?,"No. Uh, no, Your Grace. I had - I had two cups of wine."
856,"Two cups? . That's not much at all. . Please, have another cup.","Are you sure, Your Grace?"
857,"Are you sure, Your Grace?","Yes, to celebrate my name day. Have two, have as much as you like."
858,What did you say? Did you say I can't?,I only meant… it would be bad luck to kill a man on your name day.
859,"Did you hear My Lady, Ser Dontos? . From this day, , you'll be my new fool.","Thank you, Your Grace. . And you, My Lady, thank you."
860,Her loss? Her father was a confessed traitor!,But still her father. Surely having so recently lost your own beloved father you can sympathize.
861,What work? . Why are you here?,"The raven arrived from the Citadel this morning, Your Grace. The conclave has met, , considered reports from Maesters all over the Seven Kingdoms, and declared this great summer done, at last. The longest summer in living memory."
862,"You command the City Watch, do you not, Lord Slynt?","I do, Your Grace."
863,And are you not a Lord at my command?,"I owe my title and lands to your generosity, Your Grace."
864,What are you doing here?,"It's been a remarkable journey. I, , pissed off the edge of the Wall, I slept in a sky cell. . I fought with the hill tribes. So many adventures, so much to be thankful for."
865,What are you doing here? This is the small council.,"Yes., well, I, do believe the Hand of the King is welcome at all small council meetings."
866,Did you? You failed. That bit of theater will haunt our family for a generation.,Robb Stark is a child.
867,Who's won every battle he's fought. Do you understand we're losing the war?,What do you know about warfare?
868,What do you know about warfare?,Nothing. But I know people. And I know that our enemies hate each other almost as much as they hate us.
869,How?,You love your children. It's your one redeeming quality. That and your cheekbones. The Starks love their children as well. And we have two of them.
870,One?,"Arya, little animal, she disappeared."
871,"Disappeared? What, in a puff of smoke? We had three Starks to trade. You chopped one's head off and let another escape. Father will be furious. It must be odd for you to be the disappointing child.","My Lord, may the Old Gods watch over your brother and all our northern sons."
872,"Joffrey killed my father, your liege lord. Do you remember your vows, Ser?",Of course I remember!
873,"We can spare four masons for a week, My Lord. Will that be sufficient to repair your walls?",I - I believe it will.
874,"We didn't want him here all day, did we?",I didn't like the way he was talking about Robb.
875,"Did they? . I heard some other fools say it's Lannister Red. Means the Lannisters will rule all Seven Kingdoms before long. I heard a stable boy say it's the color of blood, to mark the death of your father.","The stars don't fall for men. The red comet means one thing, boy. Dragons."
876,"What did your brother say about them, Khaleesi?",He said they ate meat.
877,He didn't tell you what kind of meat?,My brother didn't know anything about dragons. He didn't know anything about anything.
878,I promised to protect them. Promised them their enemies would die screaming. How do I make starvation scream?,"A trick I never learned, I'm afraid."
879,Does it ever end?,"This is further east than I've ever been. But, yes, Khaleesi, everything ends, even the red waste."
880,And you're sure there's no other way?,"If we go south to the land of the Lazarheen, the Lamb Men will kill us and take your dragons. If we go west to the Dothraki Sea, the first Khalasar we meet will kill us and take your dragons."
881,"What do we seek, Khaleesi?","Cities, living or dead. Caravans and people. Rivers or lakes or the great salt sea. Find how far the Red Waste extends before us, and what lies on the other side."
882,Having a rough time of it?,Nothing's killed me yet.

889,"Snow, eh? Listen to me, bastard. All you lot from south of the Wall, you're Southerners. But now you're in the North, the real North.",The lad meant no harm.
890,You bring any of that good wine with you?,We did. We passed through six villages on the way here. All six were abandoned. Where have all the wildlings gone?
891,We did. We passed through six villages on the way here. All six were abandoned. Where have all the wildlings gone?,"I could tell you, but I'm thirsty."
892,You want to know where they've all gone? North! To join up with Mance Rayder Your old friend.,"He's no friend of mine. He broke his vows, betrayed his brothers!"
893,He's been calling himself that for years. What's he king of? A frozen lake somewhere?,That's a good-looking axe. Fresh forged?
894,That's a good-looking axe. Fresh forged?,Give it here.
895,"Oh, that's some lovely steel. . You want to know what Mance Rayder is doing? Gathering an army. What I hear, he's already got more men than any of your southern kings.",And where does he plan marching this army?
896,And where does he plan marching this army?,"When you're all the way north, there's only one direction to go."

905,And how many ships has the Lord of Light got in his fleet?,He has no need for ships.
906,"I owe you an apology, my King. My duty is to serve. You have chosen the new God over the Old Gods. May the Lord of Light watch over us all. Shall we drink together?",Don't.
907,"King in the North. I keep expecting you to leave me in one castle or another for safekeeping, but you drag me along from camp to camp. Have you grown fond of me, Stark? Is that it? I've never seen you with a girl.","If I left you with one of my bannermen, your father would know within a fortnight, and my bannerman would receive a raven with a message, ""Release my son and you'll be rich beyond your dreams. Refuse and your house will be destroyed, root and stem.”"
908,You don't trust the loyalty of the men following you into battle?,"Oh, I trust them with my life. Just not with yours."
909,Smart boy. What's wrong? Don't like being called ‘boy'? Insulted?,"You insult yourself, Kingslayer. You've been defeated by a boy."
910,You have proof? Or do you want to trade gossip like a couple of fishwives?,I'm sending one of your cousins down to King's Landing with my peace terms.

927,I beg your pardon?,"I'll send Rodrik to watch over the boys, ‘cause tomorrow, you'll ride south to the Stormlands."
928,"Which of these lords do I trust more than you? If Renly sides with us, we'll outnumber them two to one. When they feel the jaws beginning to shut, they'll sue for peace. We'll get the girls back. Then we'll all go home for good.",I will ride at first light.
929,What is all this?,"Returning this room to its proper appearance. Say what you will about the Targaryens, they were conquerors. That is a seat for a conqueror. It needs a room to match it, not vines and flowers."
930,Someone believes it. Father had other children? Besides me and Tommen and Myrcella?,What are you asking?
931,What are you asking?,I'm asking if he fucked other women when he grew tired of you. How many bastards does he have running -

955,If that's everything?,A raven flew in this morning from Castle Black.
956,Trouble with the wildlings?,That's why they're called wildlings.

958,How do you kill a dead man?,Apparently you burn him.
959,We fart when we die?,"My blessed mother was holding her own when she left this world. She farted so hard, the whole bed shook."
960,"Seems a bit greedy for one man to have so many wives. Wouldn't two, or three, be enough for him?",We were having a serious discussion.

971,"We're heading deeper and deeper into wildling territory. We can't take a girl with us. Mormont wouldn't have it. And even if he would, what would we do with her? Who's gonna deliver her baby? You?",I could try. . What? I've read about it. A bit.
972,I could try. . What? I've read about it. A bit.,"I'm sorry Sam, we can't help her."
973,Who did this?,"Khal Pono perhaps, Khal Jhaqo They don't like the idea of a woman leading a Khalasaar."
974,Is it as you remember my lord?,Looks smaller.
975,Who will?,"Anyone who matters, , this is a big day for them. They haven't had much to get excited about since I left. It's a hard place the Iron Islands always has been. It's cold and it's wet."
976,Shhh. Did he hurt you?,"No, my lord… It's Mhaegen."
977,Who?,"She works for you. She's the one, the girl whose, they killed her baby."
978,"You know, you remind me of another girl. A lovely thing I once acquired from an Elysium pleasure house. Beautiful, like yourself, and intelligent as yourself. But she wasn't happy. She cried, often. I asked her why but, we didn't have the kind of rapport that you and I have. Yes, it was quite sad. Girls from Elysium pleasure houses are expensive. Extremely expensive. And this one wasn't making me any money. I hate bad investments. Really, I do. They haunt me. I had no idea how to make her happy, no idea how to mitigate my losses. A very wealthy patron, he offered me a tremendous amount of money to let him transform this lovely, sad girl. To use her in ways that never occur to most men. And you know what occurs to most men. I would not say he succeeded in making her happy but my losses were definitely mitigated. . Take tonight off to mourn Mhaegen's child. I'll see you tomorrow. But you'll be happy? . That makes me happy.",More wine?
979,More wine?,"Damn it, boy!"
980,Is that your new squire? Could have found you a proper lad.,"Myself, I prefer the improper ones."
981,"Hmm, that's a good red. Dornish?","You know your wines, my lord."
982,"No, but who else would want to murder King Robert's bastards? She's always been a jealous woman.",You know your sister better than I do.
983,Are you drunk? I'll not have my honor questioned by an Imp.,"I'm not questioning your honor, Lord Janos. I'm denying its existence."
984,"Dwarf? You should have stopped at imp. And yes, you will stand here and take it from me, unless you'd like to take it from my friend here.","I intend to serve as Hand of the King until my father returns from the war, and seeing as you betrayed the last Hand of the King, well, I just wouldn't feel safe with you lurking about."
985,Boys?,I have friends at court! Powerful friends! The king himself made me a lord!
986,"If I told you to murder, an infant girl say, still at her mother's breast, would you do it without question?",Without question? No. I'd ask how much.
987,Without question? No. I'd ask how much.,"If they come back, I say we yield. Gendry's the one they want. I don't want to get caught in the middle of a battle."
988,So?,"So, if they got armor on, it's a battle."
989,What's a dyer's apprentice know about battles anyway?,"Gendry's an armorer's apprentice. Hot Pie, tell Gendry what makes it a battle."
990,A knight?,How'd you know he was a knight?
991,How'd you know he was a knight?,"Well, cause he got armor on."
992,How'd you know?,Cause I sold armor.
993,What do the gold cloaks want with you?,No idea.
994,No goodo s ever come? Who asked questions before?,How can someone so small be such a huge pain in my ass?
995,How can someone so small be such a huge pain in my ass?,Who asked questions?
996,Who asked questions?,"The Hand of the King. Er, hands of the King. Lord Arryn came first, a few weeks before he died. And then Lord Stark came, a few weeks before he died."
997,See? Asking me questions is bad luck. . You'll probably be dead soon.,What did they ask about?
998,What did they ask about?,My mom.
999,Who's your mom?,Just my mom. Worked in a tavern. Died when I was little.
1000,And who was your father?,"He could be one of those gold-hatted bastards, for all I know. What about you, anyway? You thought they were after you, why? Did you kill someone, or is it just because you're a girl?"
1001,"He could be one of those gold-hatted bastards, for all I know. What about you, anyway? You thought they were after you, why? Did you kill someone, or is it just because you're a girl?",I'm not a girl!
1002,Yes you are. You think I'm as stupid as the rest of them?,"Stupider. Night's Watch doesn't take girls, everyone knows that."
1003,What you carrying?,Pears and oranges. Wine from the Arbor. And the heir to Pyke of the Iron Islands. . The only living son of Balon Greyjoy. . Me.
1004,You been at sea long? Or were there just no women where you came from?,None like you.
1005,You don't know what you're like. You need someone to teach you. Know who I am?,You think I offer free rides to every man in jewelry. Lord Greyjoy.
1006,Nine years. Do you still know your way around a ship? Have these hands ever touched a rope?,Don't you worry about my hands. . The sea's in my blood.
1007,Is that an offer from my future king?,"An order, from your future king. You can tell your grandchildren about this night."
1008,"Nine years, is it? They took a frightened boy. What have they given back?",A man. Your blood and your heir.
1009,And how do you feel about that?,What's done is done. I've brought you a proposal from Robb Stark.
1010,Who gave you those clothes? . Was it Ned Stark's pleasure to make you his daughter?,"If my clothes offend you, I will change them."
1011,It will. . That bauble around your neck. Did you pay the iron price for it or the gold? . I asked a question. Did you pull it from the neck of a corpse you made or did you buy it to match your fine clothes? Iron or gold?,Gold.
1012,He heeds your counsel?,"I've lived with him, hunted with him, fought at his side, he thinks of me as a brother."
1013,"No, not here, , not in my hearing, you will not name him brother. This son of the man who put your true brothers to the sword. Or have you forgotten your own blood?",I forget nothing. I remember my brothers. And I remember when my father was a king.
1014,"Oh, you will?",I'm your son. Your only living heir. Who else?
1015,I'm your son. Your only living heir. Who else?,I told you to wait outside. . How did you get past the guards?
1016,I told you to wait outside. . How did you get past the guards?,Anything with a cock is easy to fool.
1017,Yara?,"So good to see you, brother. This is a homecoming I'll tell my grandchildren about."
1018,And why not?,You're a woman!
1019,Who said anything about the Lannisters?,You'll have your gold when we take the treasury at King's Landing.
1020,"All these kings fighting for the throne, and this Stannis has the smallest army. Why would I bet on the man with the worst chance?","Because you're a smart gambler. Stannis has proved himself in war. Twice. His baby brother has never set foot on a battlefield. Neither has the false king, Joffrey."
1021,You think I'm insulted? I am a pirate. I'm an excellent pirate. I don't sail for promises.,"Of course you do. Every time you leave harbor, you're leaving on a promise. A promise that somewhere on the seas, somebody's got some gold and you can take it from them."
1022,The queen?,"Cersei, I want her. I'll sail with your fleet, all 30 of my ships, and if we don't drown at the bottom of Blackwater Bay, I will fuck this blonde queen and I will fuck her well."
1023,You believe your king can win?,He is the one true king.
1024,When will the King have a sail?,As soon as his God wills it.
1025,"You want me to have a god, fine. King Stannis is my god. He raised me up and blessed me with his trust. He gave you a future I could never have imagined. You know how to read, you'll be a knight someday. You think your fire god commanded all that? It was Stannis. Only Stannis.","Stannis is my king, but he's only a man."
1026,"Listen to me, Queen Regent, you're losing the people. Do you hear me?","Ha, the people. You think I care?"
1027,"Ha, the people. You think I care?","You might find it difficult to rule over millions who want you dead. Half the city will starve when winter comes. The other half will plot to overthrow you. And your gold-plated thugs just gave them the rallying cry, “The Queen slaughters babies.” . You don't even have the decency to deny it."
1028,"It wasn't you who gave the order, was it? Joffrey didn't even tell you. Or did he tell you? I imagine that would be even worse.","He did what needed to be done. . You want to be the Hand of the King? You want to rule? This is what ruling is! Lying on a bed of weeds, ripping them out by the root one by one before they strangle you in your sleep."
1029,"He did what needed to be done. . You want to be the Hand of the King? You want to rule? This is what ruling is! Lying on a bed of weeds, ripping them out by the root one by one before they strangle you in your sleep.","I'm no king, but I think there's more to ruling that that."
1030,"You're funny. . You've always been funny. But none of your jokes will ever match the first one, will they? You remember... back when you ripped my mother open on your way out of her and she bled to death.",She was my mother too.
1031,How did it fare with your pirate?,Salladhor Saan will join our fleet. 30 ships. His men know how to fight.
1032,It won't be a choice this time. Do you trust him?,"Salladhor Saan is an old friend, I've known him 30 years. I've never trusted him."
1033,What did you say to him?,I told him death by fire is the purest death.
1034,Why?,Because it is true. You're troubled my king.
1035,"Faith? In a real war, the side with the greater number wins nine times out of ten.",Then we must be the ten.
1036,A son?,"Out, all of you."
1037,What did you do?,"I followed him. He took the baby into the woods, the newborn."
1038,What business is that of yours?,"No, you don't understand. He's killing them, all the boys..."
1039,Offerings? He's murdering his own children. He's a monster.,"Aye, many a time that monster has been the difference between life and death for our rangers, your uncle among them. We have other wars to fight, out there. Like it or not, we need men like Craster."
1040,"Hodor. Rouse Bran, will you? It's time for his lessons.",Every night it's the same.
1041,So she was lying? They don't exist?,"Well, they may have done. But they're gone from the world, along with much else. These are dreams, Bran, nothing more."
1042,What about all the dreams you had that didn't come true? Hmm? Right.,"This link is made of Valyrian steel. Only one maester in a hundred wears it on his chain. It signifies that I have studied the higher mysteries. And all who study these mysteries try their hand at spells. I was no different. I was young. And what boy doesn't secretly wish for hidden powers to lift him out of his dull life into a special one? But in the end, for all my efforts, I got no more out of it than a thousand boys before me. Come on."
1043,"This link is made of Valyrian steel. Only one maester in a hundred wears it on his chain. It signifies that I have studied the higher mysteries. And all who study these mysteries try their hand at spells. I was no different. I was young. And what boy doesn't secretly wish for hidden powers to lift him out of his dull life into a special one? But in the end, for all my efforts, I got no more out of it than a thousand boys before me. Come on.",All right. Maybe magic once was a mighty force in the world. But not anymore. The dragons are gone. The giants are dead. And the Children of the Forest forgotten.
1044,What?,"I will be one of your seven, pledge my life to yours, and keep you safe from all harm."
1045,"Lady Catelyn. I'm pleased to see you. May I present my wife, Margaery of House Tyrell?","You are very welcome here, Lady Stark. I'm so sorry for your loss."
1046,Has your son marched against Tywin Lannister yet?,"I do not sit on my son's war councils. And if I did, I would not share his strategies with you."
1047,Gerard. How's your foot?,"Better, Your Grace."
1048,"And all of them young and bold like your Knight of Flowers? It's a game to you, isn't it? I pity them.",Why?
1049,Why?,Because it won't last. Because they are the knights of summer and winter is coming.
1050,"At once, Your Grace. Shall I return after?",That won't be necessary. I would pray awhile. Alone.
1051,What are you doing here?,"I live here. Are you angry with me, brother?"
1052,"I live here. Are you angry with me, brother?",You lying bitch.
1053,Recognize you? How could I? The last time I saw you- you looked like a fat little boy.,"You were a fat little boy, too, but I recognized you."
1054,Why didn't you tell me?,I wanted to see who you were first. And I did.
1055,"The wolf pup has gone south with the entirety of the Northern army at his back. While he's tangling with the lion in the Westerlands, the North is ripe for the taking. The Ironborn will reave and pillage, as it was in the old days, all along the northern coast. We'll spread our dominion across the green lands, securing the Neck and everything above. Every stronghold will yield to us, one by one. Winterfell may defy us for a year, but what of it? The rest shall be ours, forest, field, and hall.","Yara, my daughter, you'll take thirty longships to attack Deepwood Motte."
1056,And what's my role in all this?,You'll take a ship to raid the fishing villages on the Stoney Shore.
1057,A ship? You give her thirty and I get one?,The Sea Bitch. We thought she'd be perfect for you.
1058,I'm to fight fishermen?,Be careful of their nets.
1059,"What do you know of it, woman? I'm a proven warrior.","Your brothers were warriors, both of them dead at the hands of those you seem so eager to protect."
1060,"I'm not protecting anyone. I just wonder if it's not wiser to wait. Why risk going against the North if they would be our allies? Rise up against them and they could destroy us. But if we pledge fealty to them, they'll give us Casterly Rock.",What are our words? Our words?
1061,What are our words? Our words?,We do not sow.
1062,"You act as if I volunteered to go. You gave me away, if you remember. The day you bent the knee to Robert Baratheon. After he crushed you. Did you take what was yours then?",You gave me away!
1063,You'd have our father bow down to your other family?,I have no other family.
1064,"Don't you? Make your choice, Theon, and do it quickly. Our ships sail with or without you.",You won't let me leave this room. You won't let me-
1065,Why? You think your father can hear me? He's three hundred miles away!,I don't intend for you to stay here. I might be able to bring you into the castle kitchens.
1066,Scullion? What is a scullion?,Kitchen wench.
1067,A kitchen wench?,"Yes, but-"
1068,Cleaning pots? Is that how my lion wants to see me?,Your lion wants to see you alive. We've come to a dangerous place. My sister wants to hurt me. She'll look for any weakness she can find. She can't know about you.
1069,I'm the weakness?,"It's a compliment, my lady."
1070,How is being a weakness a compliment?,Language can be a bit tricky here.
1071,When will Joffrey and Sansa be married?,"Soon, darling, when the war is over."
1072,Is Joffrey going to kill Sansa's brother?,He might.
1073,Would you like that?,No. I don't think so.
1074,"Even if he does, Sansa will do her duty. Won't you, little dove?",Come in.
1075,Who are you?,"I'm Shae, my lady. Your new handmaiden."
1076,What are you doing?,Waiting for you to tell me what to do.
1077,What things?,"Change my linens, wash my clothing, scrub the floor, empty my chamber pot, brush my hair."
1078,Have you ever been a handmaiden before?,Yes.
1079,For whom?,Lady Zuriff.
1080,Do you want me to leave?,Just brush my hair.
1081,"I can trust you, Pycelle, can I not?","Why, yes, of course, my lord."
1082,"Matrimony, huh? Yes.","I'm trusting the council with these plans, but the Queen mustn't know. We can't have her meddling in affairs that could determine the future of the realm. There's too much at stake."
1083,Myrcella sent away to Dorne?,"But remember, the Queen mustn't know."
1084,"Theon Greyjoy? Forgive me, my lord, but how? He grew up a ward of Winterfell. He fights for Robb Stark.",Precisely.
1085,Tell no one what?,I plan to wed Princess Myrcella to Robin Arryn of the Vale. Lysa is not fond of me. But perhaps the promise of a royal match will convince her to let bygones be bygones.
1086,She imprisoned you. She tried to execute you. And you offer her son a princess?,"For men in our position, holding grudges can be an encumbrance, don't you think?"
1087,"For men in our position, holding grudges can be an encumbrance, don't you think?",And I suppose you want me to broker this agreement?
1088,And I suppose you want me to broker this agreement?,Who better?
1089,Who better?,"Yes, I could sing this song to Lysa, if I cared to. What's in it for me?"
1090,"Yes, I could sing this song to Lysa, if I cared to. What's in it for me?","The gratitude of the people of Westeros for helping to end this war, the adoration of the King for bringing the Vale back into the fold... and Harrenhal."
1091,"I need you to deliver Lysa Arryn. I didn't need Janos Slynt. It's settled, then?",Good. Oh. And remember-
1092,What? What is it?,A member of the Kingsguard? As if I wasn't humiliated enough already.
1093,A member of the Kingsguard? As if I wasn't humiliated enough already.,Brienne is a very capable warrior.
1094,Jealous? Of Brienne the Beauty? Don't make me laugh.,I'll make it up to you.
1095,And Margaery's a virgin?,Officially. Shall I bring her to you?
1096,Officially. Shall I bring her to you?,"I should warn you, I've had quite a bit of wine."
1097,"You think so? I can't decide how I like it better. This way, or this way.",You certainly don't need it.
1098,Do you want my brother to come in and help?,What?
1099,What?,He could get you started. I know he wouldn't mind. Or I can turn over and you can pretend I'm him.
1100,You monster. Myrcella is my only daughter. Do you really think I'll let you sell her like a common whore?,Myrcella's a princess. Some would say she was born for this.
1101,Are you mad? The Martells loathe us.,That's why we need to seduce them. We're going to need their support in the war your son started.
1102,"Just how safe do you think Myrcella is if this city falls? Do you want to see her raped, butchered like the Targaryen children? Make no mistake. They'll mount her pretty little head on a spike right beside yours.",Get out! Get out!
1103,"Theon of the House Greyjoy, you would this day consecrate your faith to the Drowned God?",I would.
1104,"I don't appreciate being made a fool of, dwarf. If Myrcella marries the Martell boy, she can't very well marry Robin Arryn, can she?","No, afraid not. Sorry about that."
1105,"No, he won't. But his mother might. How would you like to see your beloved Cat again?",Find him?
1106,Find him?,"Oh, aye. And he has company. Filthy old stoat. Almost hate to interrupt."
1107,What is the meaning of this?,"No, please, please."
1108,How long have you been spying for my sister?,"All I did, I did for House Lannister. Always. Your lord father, ask him. I've always been his servant since the days of the Mad King."
1109,What? What?,"Oh, no. No."
1110,"How many Hands have you betrayed, Pycelle? Eddard Stark? Jon Arryn?","Oh, Lord Arryn, h-he knew. He, he knew the t-truth about, about, about the Queen. An-And he planned to act, to t-tell King Robert."
1111,So you poisoned him?,No. Never.
1112,And it seems the Grand Maester has found his way into a black cell?,"Well played, My Lord Hand. But should I be worried? Janos Slynt, Pycelle - The Small Council grows smaller every day."
1113,"Well played, My Lord Hand. But should I be worried? Janos Slynt, Pycelle - The Small Council grows smaller every day.",The Council has a reputation for serving past Hands poorly. I don't mean to follow Ned Stark to the grave.
1114,"Power is a curious thing, my lord. Are you fond of riddles?","Why, am I about to hear one?"
1115,"Why, am I about to hear one?","Three great men sit in a room. A king, a priest and a rich man. Between them stands a common sellsword. Each great man bids the sellsword kill the other two. Who lives, who dies?"
1116,"Three great men sit in a room. A king, a priest and a rich man. Between them stands a common sellsword. Each great man bids the sellsword kill the other two. Who lives, who dies?",Depends on the sellsword.
1117,Does it? He has neither crown nor gold nor favor with the gods.,"He has a sword, the power of life and death."
1118,"But if it's swordsmen who rule, why do we pretend kings hold all the power? When Ned Stark lost his head, who was truly responsible? Joffrey? The executioner? Or something else?",I've decided I don't like riddles.
1119,What?,How do you sleep?
1120,How do you sleep?,"Same as most men, I think."
1121,How do you sleep when you... when you have those things in your head?,You didn't see that. I made damn sure.
1122,"You know, we've got something in common, me and you. You know that? I must have been a couple of years older than you. I saw my brother stabbed through the heart right on our doorstep. He weren't much of a villain what skewered him. Willem, the lado s name was. He ran off before anyone could spit. And I just stood there, watching my brother die. Here's the funny part. I can't picture my brother's face anymore. But Willem, oh, he was a nice-looking boy. He had good white teeth, blue eyes, one of those dimpled chins all the girls like. I would think about him when I was working, when I was drinking, when I was having a shit. It got to the point where I would say his name every night before I went to bed. Willem. Willem. Willem. A prayer almost. Well, one day, Willem came riding back into town. I buried an ax so deep into Willem's skull, they had to bury him with it. Willem's horse got me to the Wall and I've been wearing black ever since. Well... That'll help you sleep, eh?","Ho! Get up, you lazy sons of whores! Arm yourselves."
1123,"Keep out of sight. If things go wrong, you run. Do you hear me? You run along north and don't look back.","Hey, there's men out there who want to fuck your corpses. Outside, now!"
1124,Loras Tyrell?,Loras Tyrell. He's prettier than the Queen.
1125,"How good could he be? He's been stabbing Renly Baratheon for years, and Renly ain't dead.",The horses seem a little spooked to you? They're horses.
1126,The horses seem a little spooked to you? They're horses.,They get spooked by their own shadows.
1127,Shh. Do you hear that?,No.
1128,"I swear you pissed yourself. ""Oh, who goes there? Ahh!""",There is something out there.
1129,Do you think I'm an idiot?,Rennick!
1130,What's your name?,Talisa.
1131,Your last name?,You want to know what side my family fights on?
1132,You want to know what side my family fights on?,You know my family name. You have me at a disadvantage.
1133,That boy did?,The family he fights for.
1134,Do you think he's friends with King Joffrey? He's a fisherman's son that grew up near Lannisport. He probably never held a spear before they shoved one in his hands a few months ago.,I have no hatred for the lad.
1135,You're going to kill Joffrey?,If the gods give me strength.
1136,And then what?,I don't know. We'll go back to Winterfell. I have no desire to sit on the Iron Throne.
1137,So who will?,I don't know.
1138,"You're fighting to overthrow a king, and yet you have no plan for what comes after?",First we have to win the war.
1139,Volantis? You're far from home. The boy was lucky you were here.,He was unlucky that you were.
1140,What is the meaning of this?,What kind of knight beats a helpless girl?
1141,What kind of knight beats a helpless girl?,"The kind who serves his king, Imp."
1142,Someone get the girl something to cover herself with. She is to be your queen. Have you no regard for her honor?,I'm punishing her.
1143,"For what crimes? She did not fight her brother's battle, you half-wit.",You can't talk to me like that. The king can do as he likes!
1144,The Mad King did as he liked. Has your Uncle Jaime ever told you what happened to him?,No one threatens His Grace in the presence of the Kingsguard.
1145,"I'm not threatening the king, ser. I am educating my nephew. Bronn, the next time Ser Meryn speaks, kill him. That was a threat. See the difference?",I apologize for my nephew's behavior. Tell me the truth. Do you want an end to this engagement?
1146,I apologize for my nephew's behavior. Tell me the truth. Do you want an end to this engagement?,"I am loyal to King Joffrey, my one true love."
1147,You think dipping his wick will cure what ails him?,There's no cure for being a cunt. But the boy's at that age. And he's got nothing to do all day but pick wings off flies. Couldn't hurt to get some of the poison out.
1148,"What are you doing here, dog?",Your uncle left your nameday present and asked me to see that you got it.
1149,And? What is it?,"Look inside, Your Grace."
1150,Could you hit her?,My uncle sent you?
1151,My uncle sent you?,"Yes, Your Grace. He chose us himself."
1152,"Now you do the Lannisters' bidding, is that it? Tell me, was my brother's body even cold before you secured your newest patron?",I'm a practical man.
1153,And who would you have me be loyal to? Your brother's corpse?,"I don't like you, Lord Baelish. I don't like your face. I don't like the words that come oozing out of your mouth. I don't want you in my tent one minute more than necessary. So tell me, why are you here?"
1154,"I don't like you, Lord Baelish. I don't like your face. I don't like the words that come oozing out of your mouth. I don't want you in my tent one minute more than necessary. So tell me, why are you here?",You can trust Brienne. Her loyalty comes without charge.
1155,"Your tent""? Not ""Our tent""? The king snores, perhaps? Or simply prefers solitude? Pressures of command, no doubt. Four kings vying for the throne.","I am not tutored in warfare, but basic arithmetic favors the side with the greater numbers."
1156,"And on the night of your wedding, who was by the king's side then?",You seem quite interested in our marriage.
1157,"You've never married, have you?","I've been unlucky in my affections, sadly."
1158,Qarth?,"Three days to the east, on the sea."
1159,Will they let us in?,They said they would be honored to receive the Mother of Dragons.
1160,What do you know of this place?,"Only that the desert around their walls is called the Garden of Bones. Every time the Qartheen shut their gates on a traveler, the garden grows."
1161,What kind of fire melts stone?,Dragonfire.
1162,There's dragons here?,"No, all the dragons are dead."
1163,What's that smell?,Dead people.
1164,They take someone every day?,Does anyone live?
1165,Does anyone live?,Joffrey. Cersei. llyn Payne. The Hound. Joffrey. Cersei. llyn Payne. The Hound. Joffrey. Cersei. llyn Payne. The Hound.
1166,How dare you?,You may have heard false reports.
1167,Betrayed? I wanted him to serve as Protector of the Realm. I begged him to seize the moment.,I trusted you. My husband trusted you. And you repaid our faith with treachery.
1168,Have you lost your mind? Get out!,"Do you want to see your girls again? Sansa, more beautiful than ever? And Arya, just as wild as ever?"
1169,"Do you want to see your girls again? Sansa, more beautiful than ever? And Arya, just as wild as ever?","You have Arya, too?"
1170,"You have Arya, too?",Both girls are healthy and safe. For now. But you know the Queen and you know Joffrey. I fear for their longevity if they remain in the capital.
1171,What do you want?,The Lannisters will trade your daughters for the Kingslayer.
1172,Of course they will. Jaime Lannister for two girls? Robb will never agree to those terms.,I'm not bringing these terms to him. I'm bringing them to you.
1173,You think I keep secrets from my son?,"Robb has surprised them all with his skills in battle, but he's not a mother. Consider it, Cat. You may not get another chance. I've brought you a gift."
1174,Good faith?,What's this?
1175,What's this?,Your husband was an honorable man. He should rest beside his family in the crypts beneath Winterfell. You may not believe
1176,The Mountain. What are you doing?,He told me he stares at him every day. That's why he doesn't get picked.
1177,Is there gold and silver in the village?,I don't know.
1178,Gems?,I didn't see any.
1179,Where is the Brotherhood?,I don't know. Please.
1180,Which of the villagers aided them?,Who?
1181,Who?,I-
1182,Who helped him?,"Ganes, the butcher, and his son."
1183,"No, stop, please! What are you doing? Please, stop! Please, stop!",No! No! I told you everything! No! No!
1184,Can that truly be you?,Who else might it be?
1185,Who else might it be?,"When I saw your standard, I couldn't be sure. Whose banner is that?"
1186,"When I saw your standard, I couldn't be sure. Whose banner is that?",My own.
1187,"I suppose if we used the same one, the battle would be terribly confusing. Why is your stag on fire?",The king has taken for his sigil the fiery heart of the Lord of Light.
1188,Born amidst salt and smoke? Is he a ham?,That's twice I've warned you.
1189,"Look across those fields, brother. Can you see all those banners?",You think a few bolts of cloth will make you king?
1190,You think a few bolts of cloth will make you king?,No. The men holding those bolts of cloth will make me king.
1191,Would you believe I loved him once?,I thought we were welcome.
1192,Horde?,My name is Daenerys-
1193,"You know me, my lord?","Only by reputation, Khaleesi. And I'm no lord, merely a humble merchant. They call you the Mother of Dragons."
1194,And what should I call you?,"Oh, my name is quite long and quite impossible for foreigners to pronounce. I am simply a trader of spices. But we are the Thirteen, charged with the governance and protection of Qarth, the greatest city that ever was or will be."
1195,Might we see the dragons?,"My friend, we have traveled very far. We have no food, no water. Once I see my people fed, I would be honored"
1196,What are you doing? You promised to receive me.,"We have received you. Here we are, and here you are."
1197,The girl threatens to burn our city to the ground and you would invite her in for a cup of wine? She is the Mother of Dragons.,"Do you expect her to watch her people starve without breathing fire? I believe we can allow a few Dothraki through our gates without dooming our city. After all, here I am, a savage from the Summer Isles, and Qarth still stands."
1198,"Do you expect her to watch her people starve without breathing fire? I believe we can allow a few Dothraki through our gates without dooming our city. After all, here I am, a savage from the Summer Isles, and Qarth still stands.",Our decision is final.
1199,Is there gold or silver in the village?,I'm not from the village.
1200,What's this?,"We weren't expecting you till tomorrow, Lord Tywin."
1201,Evidently not. Why are these prisoners not in their cells?,"Cells are overflowing, my lord."
1202,Are we so well-manned that we can afford to discard able young bodies and skilled laborers?,"You, do you have a trade?"
1203,"You, do you have a trade?","Smith, my lord."
1204,"What are you looking at? Kneel! Kneel or I'll carve your lungs out, boy.","He'll do no such thing. This one's a girl, you idiot, dressed as a boy. Why?"
1205,"He'll do no such thing. This one's a girl, you idiot, dressed as a boy. Why?","Safer to travel, my lord."
1206,So it is. Will you take a cup with me? I find that mulled wine helps me sleep.,"I am here at Her Grace's behest, not to drink with you, Imp."
1207,"If my sister was so concerned for Pycelle, I would have thought she'd come herself. Instead she sends you. What am I to make of that?","I don't care what you make of it, so long as you release your prisoner immediately."
1208,And you've received these instructions directly from Cersei?,As I said several times.
1209,And you've waited this long to deliver the information?,"When the Queen Regent gives me a command, I carry it out without delay."
1210,"An anointed knight, yes. Tell me, did Cersei have you knighted before or after she took you into her bed? What? Nothing to say? No more warnings for me, ser?",You will withdraw these filthy accusations.
1211,Have you ever given any thought to what King Joffrey will have to say when he finds out you've been bedding his mother?,It's not my fault!
1212,"Did she take you against your will? Can you not defend yourself, knight?","Your own father, Lord Tywin, when I was named the King's squire, he told me to obey her in everything."
1213,"Did he tell you to fuck her, too?",I only meant I did as I was bid.
1214,"Hated every moment of it, is that what you'll have me believe? A high place in court, a knighthood, my sister's legs spreading open for you at night. Oh, yes, it must have been terrible. Wait here. His Grace will want to hear this.","Mercy! Mercy, my lord! I beg you."
1215,My lord?,"You heard me. My father told you to obey my sister. Obey her. Stay close to her side. Keep her trust. Pleasure her whenever she requires. No one ever need know, as long as you keep faith with me. I want to know what Cersei is doing, where she goes, who she sees, what they talk of, everything. And you will tell me."
1216,But her demands?,"Oh, I'll give her Pycelle."
1217,You will?,"Yes, I'll release him in the morning. Cersei can keep him as a pet, if she wants, but I will not have him on the Council. I could swear that I had not harmed a single hair on his head, but that would not, strictly speaking, be true. Stay within one table length."
1218,Do your knuckle bones bring you luck?,"Well, life's been good since you hacked them off, Your Grace. And it's four less fingernails to clean."
1219,Pardon?,Four fewer fingernails to clean. Never understood why you had to wear them.
1220,Does he listen?,"To me? Gods, no. But if your Red Woman told him to leap from the crow's nest"
1221,"To me? Gods, no. But if your Red Woman told him to leap from the crow's nest",She has a name. I trust you've not forgotten your smuggler's tricks.
1222,"Any shore, any night. What am I bringing ashore?",The Red Woman. No one must know what you do and we'll not speak of this again.
1223,"Are you afraid, Onion Knight?",Someone once told me the night is dark and full of terrors.
1224,"You've carried more unpleasant cargo in your time. Are you a good man, Ser Davos Seaworth?","I'd say my parts are mixed, my lady, good and bad."
1225,And which are you?,"Oh, good. I'm a knight myself, of sorts, a champion of light and life."
1226,Do you love your wife?,I do.
1227,You swear it?,By the mother. My son has no interest in the Iron Throne.
1228,And the wording of this oath?,"The same Ned Stark swore to Robert eighteen years ago. Cat, their friendship held the kingdoms together."
1229,And in return for my son's loyalty?,"In the morning, I'll destroy my brother's army."
1230,Negotiate with Stannis? You heard him out there. I'd have better luck debating the wind.,Please bring my terms to your son. I believe we are natural allies. I hope he feels the same. Together we could end this war in a fortnight.
1231,I don't believe that. You don't believe that. Who gained the most from our king's death?,Stannis.
1232,"Tell me, Ser Loras, what do you desire most in this world?",Revenge.
1233,Do you want to be a queen?,No. I want to be the queen.
1234,Killed? By whom?,Accounts differ. Most seem to implicate Catelyn Stark in some way.
1235,Really? Who'd have thought?,"Some say it was one of his own Kingsguard, while still others say it was Stannis himself who did it after negotiations went sour."
1236,"Aren't there other things you should be doing, like sealing my daughter in a crate so you can ship her away?",She'll be safer in Dorne.
1237,So clever. Aren't you always so clever with your schemes and your plots?,Schemes and plots are the same thing. They are going to attack us. We need to be ready.
1238,May I ask specifically what the king has in mind?,"You may, specifically, or you may ask vaguely. The answer will be the same."
1239,"Wildfire? You wouldn't lie to me, would you, cousin?",No.
1240,It is not a lie. Why would I lie?,"Tell me, if the vile allegations against my brother and sister are true, do you think it will make Jaime more likely to kill you or less likely? When I tell him you're fucking her, I mean."
1241,"Tell me, if the vile allegations against my brother and sister are true, do you think it will make Jaime more likely to kill you or less likely? When I tell him you're fucking her, I mean.",I'm telling you the truth.
1242,When did she tell you this?,"I heard her talking with the pyromancer. And the other night, after I left her, she went to meet him. I swear to you."
1243,Swear to me on what?,On my life.
1244,What is it?,"I'm sorry about your brother, Your Grace, I wanted to let you know that people grieve for him."
1245,You've come to lecture me on truth?,I've come to tell you that what I saw.
1246,When do we sail for King's Landing?,"As soon as I've consolidated my troops. We'll make short work of the Lannisters' fleet. Once Blackwater Bay is cleared, we'll deliver our troops to their doorstep and take the city."
1247,And will you bring Lady Melisandre with you?,That's not your concern.
1248,I never thought I'd have reason to doubt your loyalty. Was I wrong?,Loyal service means telling hard truths.
1249,"Oh, truth again. All right, what's the truth? The hard truth?",She's a foreigner preaching her foreign religion. Some believe she whispers orders in your ear and you obey.
1250,What do you believe?,You won those bannermen from Renly. Don't lose them to her.
1251,"Stannis has more infantry, more ships, more horses. What do we have?",There's that mind of yours you keep going on about.
1252,Good thing. I'd be out of a job. What about your father?,"He hasn't sent a raven in weeks. He's very busy. Being repeatedly humiliated by Robb Stark is time-consuming. We won't be able to hold the city against Stannis, not the way Joffrey's planning on holding it."
1253,"We are swollen, bloated, foul. Brother fornicates with sister in the bed of kings and we're surprised when the fruit of their incest is rotten? Yes, a rotten king.",It's hard to argue with his assessment.
1254,What? Demon monkey?,People think you're pulling the king's strings. They blame you for the city's ills.
1255,Blame me? I'm trying to save them.,You don't need to convince me.
1256,You're the crew of the Sea Bitch? I'm your commander. Welcome.,Stop. Stop! Your captain commands you to stop!
1257,"Where are we headed, Captain?","The Stony Shore, to raid their villages. There'll be spoils in it for you, and women, if you do your jobs well."
1258,And who decides if we've done our jobs well?,I do. Your captain.
1259,"I have been reaving and raping since before you left Balon's balls, Captain. Don't reckon I've got much use for your ideas on how to do it. Don't reckon I've got much use for a captain at all. I'm thinking I can do the job of captain real well myself. All I need is a ship. You wouldn't know where I could find myself a ship now, would you?","You could do that, take the ship, head out on your own. And I will hunt you down, drag you back here in chains and hang you for a traitor."
1260,Who are you?,"Dagmer, your first mate."
1261,Why aren't you with the rest of them? Or did they send you to row me out and dump me halfway in the sea? That would be good for a laugh.,They're not gonna respect you until you prove yourself.
1262,And how am I supposed to prove myself by pillaging piss-poor fishing villages?,You're not.
1263,They're all Iron Islanders. Do they do as they're told or do they do as they like?,The Stony Shore's not far from Torrhen's Square.
1264,"The seat of the House of Tallhart, a more impressive prize than a few fishermen's daughters. What, you don't think we could take it?","No, we could. We could never hold it for more than a few days. As soon as Winterfell got word that we'd taken Torrhen's Square, the Starks would send their men to take it back. And then-"
1265,"And I'm sure if those same spies snuck into our own encampments, they would report growing discontent amongst the Southern lords. This is war, no one's content. We've underestimated the Stark boy for too long. He has a good mind for warfare, his men worship him. And as long as he keeps winning battles, they'll keep believing he is King in the North. You've been waiting for him to fail. He is not going to fail, not without our help. So how do we stop him?","We've worked through the night, my lord. Perhaps we'd profit from some sleep."
1266,"Not wine, water. We'll be here for some time. Girl, where are you from?","Maidenpool, my lord."
1267,And who are the Lords of Maidenpool? Remind me.,"House Mooton, my lord."
1268,And what is their sigil?,"A red salmon. I think a Maidenpool girl would remember that. You're a Northerner, aren't you?"
1269,"A red salmon. I think a Maidenpool girl would remember that. You're a Northerner, aren't you?","Good. One more time, where are you from?"
1270,"Good. One more time, where are you from?","Barrowton, my lord. House Dustin. Two crossed longaxes beneath a black crown."
1271,And what do they say of Robb Stark in the North?,They call him the Young Wolf.
1272,And?,They say he rides into battle on the back of a giant direwolf. They say he can turn into a wolf himself when he wants. They say he can't be killed.
1273,And do you believe them?,"No, my lord. Anyone can be killed."
1274,"A girl keeps her mouth closed. No one hears, and friends may talk in secret, yes? A boy becomes a girl.",I was always a girl.
1275,And you fetch water for one of them now. Why is this right for you and wrong for me?,I didn't have a choice.
1276,Three what?,"The Red God takes what is his, lovely girl. And only death may pay for life. You saved me and the two I was with. You stole three deaths from the Red God. We have to give them back. Speak three names and the man will do the rest. Three lives I will give you, no more, no less, and we're done."
1277,I can name anyone and you'll kill him?,A man has said.
1278,When will he come?,The Halfhand does things in his own time.
1279,"Beautiful, isn't it? Gilly would love it here.",There's nothing more sickening than a man in love.
1280,"Thousands and thousands of years ago, the First Men stood here where we're standing all through the long night. What do you think they were like, the First Men?",Stupid. Smart people don't find themselves in places like this.
1281,Wildlings?,One blast is for rangers returning. Wildlings is two blasts.
1282,"But if it's been a thousand years, how do you know?",Well I read it in a book.
1283,To do what?,The jars are put in catapults and flung at the enemy.
1284,How much do you have?,"If you could get real soldiers to man the catapults, then maybe you'd hit your target one time in ten, but all the real soldiers are in the Riverlands with your father."
1285,"Well, he's not living anymore. And all his pots of wildfire didn't help him, did they? Men win wars, not magic tricks.","We have been working tirelessly, day and night, ever since your royal sister commanded us to do so. Our present count stands at 7,811. Enough to burn Stannis Baratheon's fleet and armies both."
1286,Did you see the dress Xaro had made for you? They say he's the wealthiest man in Qarth.,It is known.
1287,What are they doing?,"Malakko says the statue is too heavy to carry. Kovarro says that Malakko is an idiot. They can pry out the gems, the rest is pure gold. Very soft. He can chop off as much as we can carry."
1288,Why not?,Our host saved us from the Red Waste and you want to steal from him? I will hear no more.
1289,Our host saved us from the Red Waste and you want to steal from him? I will hear no more.,My brother used to say the only thing the Dothraki knew how to do was steal things better men have built.
1290,"Mother of Dragons. On behalf of the warlocks of Qarth, I welcome you. A demonstration?",Take this gem. Look at it. Into its depths. So many facets. Look closely enough and you can see yourself in them. Often more than once.
1291,What is the House of the Undying?,"It is where the warlocks go to squint at dusty books and drink shade of the evening. It turns their lips blue and their minds soft. So soft, they actually believe their parlor tricks are magic."
1292,Do I know you?,I know you. Jorah Mormont of Bear Island.
1293,Who are you?,"I'm no one. But she is the Mother of Dragons. She needs true protectors, now more than ever. They shall come day and night to see the wonder born into the world again. And when they see, they shall lust, for dragons are fire made flesh. And fire is power."
1294,"Will you stay there long, my lady?","Only long enough to tell Robb what I have seen. After that, I will leave for Winterfell. My two youngest need me. I've been away from them for far too long."
1295,"Once you're safely back amongst your own people, will you give me leave to go, my lady?",You mean to kill Stannis.
1296,Torrhen's Square is barely forty leagues from here. How can the Lannisters strike so far north?,Might be a raiding party led by the Mountain. Might be sellswords paid by Tywin Lannister.
1297,Do you need so many?,"If we can't protect our own bannermen, why should they protect us? Go, Ser Rodrik. Take the men you need."
1298,"If we can't protect our own bannermen, why should they protect us? Go, Ser Rodrik. Take the men you need.","Won't take long, my lord. Southerners don't do well up here."
1299,"So, what does it mean?",Ask your Maester Luwin. He's the one studying books all the time.
1300,"So, you've been dreaming of a three-eyed raven again? In the godswood, you told me you didn't dream. Now who's a liar? What did you see in your dream?","Something bad? Tell me, boy."
1301,"Something bad? Tell me, boy.","I dreamt that the sea came to Winterfell. I saw waves crashing against the gates and the water came flowing over the walls. It flooded the castle. Drowned men were floating here, in the yard. Ser Rodrik was one of them."
1302,"Osha. The three-eyed raven, what do they say about it north of the Wall?",They say all sorts of crazy things north of the Wall.
1303,Where?,On that mountain.
1304,How many wildlings have joined him?,"From what we can tell, all of them. Mance has gathered them all like deer against the wolves. They're almost ready to make their move."
1305,Where?,Somewhere safe. Somewhere south. Can't just march into their midst. And we can't wait for them here with nothing but a pile of stones to protect us.
1306,You saying we should fall back to the Wall?,"Mance was one of us once. Now he's one of them. He's going to teach them our way of doing things. They'll hit us in force and they won't run away when we hit back. They're gonna be more organized than before, more disciplined, more like us. So we need to be more like them, do things their way. Sneak in, kill Mance, and scatter them to the winds before they can march on the Wall. And to do that"
1307,I've fought and killed a wight. How many rangers can say that?,He's the one?
1308,He's the one?,Aye. You killed a wight. You also let an old man beat you bloody and take your sword.
1309,"Craster? In the boy's defense, that's a tough old goat.","I could take up Jon's duties while he's gone, my lord. It would be no trouble."
1310,"So, tell me, how long has your manservant been in love with you?",He's not my manservant and he's not in love with me. He's my advisor and he's my friend.
1311,And what about what a woman wants?,"Much more complicated. You, for example, what do you want?"
1312,"Much more complicated. You, for example, what do you want?",To cross the Narrow Sea and take back the Iron Throne.
1313,Why?,Because I promised my khalasar I'd protect them and find them a safe home.
1314,You want to conquer the Seven Kingdoms for the Dothraki?,I want them because they're mine by right. The Iron Throne is mine and I will take it.
1315,And how did you get all of this? Did someone give it to you?,"No. I come from nothing. I hit the docks like a piece of cargo, except someone normally cares what happens to cargo."
1316,"What do you want, Xaro Xhoan Daxos? At the gates of the city, you bled for me. Why?",I will show you why.
1317,And behind the door?,And it can all be mine?
1318,And it can all be mine?,"All? Let us say half. More than enough to buy horses, ships, armies. Enough to go home."
1319,"All? Let us say half. More than enough to buy horses, ships, armies. Enough to go home.",All I have to do?
1320,All I have to do?,Is marry me.
1321,"See? I have more ambition than you thought. The time is right, Daenerys Targaryen, First of Your Name. Robert Baratheon is dead.",If you cross the sea with an army you bought and a foreign husband who paid for it...
1322,According to your new friend who earned your trust by cutting his hand?,The time to strike is now. We need to find ships and an army or we'll spend the rest of our lives rotting away at the edge of the world.
1323,What do you want? Tell me.,To see you on the Iron Throne.
1324,Why?,"You have a good claim. A title. A birthright. But you have something more than that. You may cover it up and deny it, but you have a gentle heart. You would not only be respected and feared, you would be loved. Someone who can rule and should rule. Centuries come and go without a person like that coming into the world. There are times when I look at you and I still can't believe you're real."
1325,"So what would you have me do, as my advisor?","Make your own way. Find your own ship. You only need one. The allies we need are in Westeros, not Qarth."
1326,And how do I get the ship?,I'll find it for you. A sound ship with a good captain.
1327,Sideface?,Sideways.
1328,Why?,Smaller target.
1329,Am I fighting someone?,You're practicing for a fight. You should practice right.
1330,Guards! Did you see anything? Go up there. Go and see where he fell from.,Go up the battlement.
1331,Theon?,It's Prince Theon now. Get up. You have to get dressed. I've taken Winterfell. I took it. I'm occupying it. I sent men over the walls with grappling claws and ropes.
1332,Why?,To take the castle.
1333,And he sent me back to Pyke. I'm a Greyjoy. I can't fight for Robb and my father both. Where's Hodor?,I don't know.
1334,Theon. Did you hate us the whole time?,I've yielded Winterfell to Theon.
1335,"If you serve me as loyally as you served Ned Stark, I will be as good to you as he ever was. Betray me, and you will wish you hadn't. Maester Luwin, send a raven to Pyke informing my father of my victory here. And one to Deepwood Motte to my sister. Inform her that she's to bring You are a maester of the Citadel, sworn to serve the Lord of Winterfell, are you not?",I am.
1336,I see you've finally learned how to address your betters. What do you want? I was brought here a captive.,You were here the day I was taken.
1337,I'm the one who took you. What of it?,Let me serve you.
1338,"Serve me how? I need fighters, not kitchen sluts.",It was Robb Stark who put me in the kitchens. Put a spear in my hand again.
1339,So you can bury it in my neck? Do you take me for a fool? Get up.,Step aside.
1340,"Any last words, old man?","Gods help you, Theon Greyjoy. Now you are truly lost."
1341,"Look around, boy. This look like home to you? You start thinking you know this place, it will kill you. You understand me?","No, you don't. We're at war. We've always been at war. It's never going to end 'cause we're not fighting an enemy. We're fighting the North, and it's not going anywhere. The Watch has given you a great gift. You only have one thing to give in return, your life."
1342,"I don't want you to be glad about it. I want you to curse and fight until your heart's done pumping. And know this, boy. Your death will be a gift for them south of the Wall. They'll never know what you've done. They'll never know how you died. They won't even know your damn name. But they'll be alive because some nameless bastard north of the Wall gave his life for theirs. Now, do you understand me?",I do.
1343,Can you read?,My lord?
1344,My lord?,This letter detailing our infantry movements was meant for Lord Damon of House Marbrand. It was sent to Lord Marlyn of House Dormand.
1345,To whom does House Dormand owe allegiance?,"My lord, I-"
1346,Wine?,Thank you.
1347,What news from the capital?,I traveled here directly from Renly Baratheon's camp.
1348,"You say that as if you were the first man alive to think it. Yes, a crisis is an opportunity. What other brilliant insights have you brought me today?","After the Lannisters and the Starks, the Tyrells command the largest host. Their lands are the most fertile in the Seven Kingdoms, feeding horses and soldiers."

1351,Why?,He had an interesting proposal for her concerning her daughters.
1352,What's your name?,Ygritte.
1353,"We'd need a big fire for that. Tell me, Ygritte. Why do you want us to build a big fire? Are there some more friends in the area?",Burn them or maybe you'll need those swords again.
1354,Our boy here's already killed one dead man. He can do it again if he has to. What waits beyond the pass?,The Free Folk.
1355,How many?,"Hundreds and thousands. More than you've ever seen, crow."
1356,Why come to the mountains? What's in the Frostfangs your king could want?,Do you mean to march on the Wall?
1357,Do you mean to march on the Wall?,"Do you know who I am, girl?"
1358,"Do you know who I am, girl?",Qhorin Halfhand.
1359,"Tell me true. If your people captured me, would they take me prisoner?","They'd take your head off your shoulders if they was feeling kind. If not, they'd kill you slow."
1360,We have no food for her. Can't spare a man to watch her. Can't let her go. She'll bring Mance Rayder's army down on us. It needs to be done. Want me to do it?,"No. No, I'll do it."
1361,"You never killed a woman before, did you? You don't need to do it. Mance would take you. I know he would. There's secret ways. The crows would never catch us.",I'm as much a crow as they are.
1362,Will you burn me? After?,Can't. Someone might see the smoke.
1363,"Did you say something, my lady?",My little brother cried when I left Winterfell.
1364,So?,It seems a normal thing.
1365,Is your little brother a prince?,No.
1366,"Not really relevant then, is it? Come, dog.","Hail Joffrey! Hail to the King. Seven blessings on you, Your Grace."

1377,"Oh, she has a talent for drama, this one. So, my little princess, what is it you want?",My birthright. The Seven Kingdoms of Westeros.
1378,Retake? Did you once sit on the Iron Throne?,"My father sat there, before he was murdered."
1379,"But if you did not sit on it yourself, would it not be correct to say ""take the Iron Throne""?",I didn't come here to argue grammar.
1380,"Of course not. You came to take my ships. So let me explain my position, little princess. Unlike you, I do not have exalted ancestors. I make my living by trade. And I judge every trade on its merits. You ask for ships. You say I shall be repaid triple. I do not doubt your honesty or your intentions. But before you repay your debts, you must seize the Seven Kingdoms. Do you have an army?",Not yet.
1381,You do not have an army. Do you have powerful allies in Westeros?,There are many there that support my claim.
1382,When were you there last?,I left when I was a baby.
1383,"Do you know lllyrio Mopatis, Magister of Pentos? Yes, we've met.",A shrewd man.
1384,"For my wedding, he gave me three petrified dragon eggs. He believed The world believed that the ages had turned them to stone. How many centuries has it been since dragons roamed the skies? But I dreamt that if I carried those eggs into a great fire, they would hatch. When I stepped into the fire, my own people thought I was mad. But when the fire burned out, I was unhurt, the Mother of Dragons.",Do you understand? I'm no ordinary woman. My dreams come true.
1385,Do you understand? I'm no ordinary woman. My dreams come true.,"I admire your passion. But in business, I trust in logic, not passion. I'm sorry, little princess."
1386,Who taught you to read?,"My father, my lord."
1387,"Hmm. I taught my son Jaime to read. The maester came to me one day, told me he wasn't learning. He couldn't make sense of the letters. He reversed them in his head. The maester said he'd heard tell of this affliction and that we simply must accept it. Ha! After that, I sat Jaime down for four hours every day until he learned. He hated me for it, for a time. For a long time. But he learned. Hmm. Where is your father? Is he alive? Who was he?",A stonemason.
1388,A stonemason who could read? Hmm.,He taught himself.
1389,Quite a man. What killed him?,Loyalty.

1393,Why?,Lord Tywin sent me.

1396,Why would he do that? Let's go and ask him.,Move! Get out of the way!

1398,"What if I told you my father sold lace on the Long Bridge, and my mother, my brother, and I lived with him above our shop?",I'd call you a liar.
1399,Will we be here long?,I couldn't really discuss troop movements with you.
1400,Lady Talisa...?,Maegyr.
1401,"Maegyr? Forgive me, I do not know this name.","An uncommon name here. An old name in Volantis. Excuse me, my lady. Your Grace."

1403,Here? There's no shelter here.,There's no shelter anywhere.
1404,Think they're out looking for you?,Yes.
1405,Think they'll find you?,"You're brave. Stupid, but brave."
1406,Was I? I didn't notice that time.,This cannot be true.
1407,Why? Why would Theon-,Because the Greyjoys are treasonous whores.
1408,My brothers?,We've heard nothing of them. But Rodrik Cassel is dead.
1409,How can I call myself king if I can't hold my own castle? How can I ask men to follow me if I can't-,You are a king. And that means you don't have to do everything yourself.
1410,Why on earth would I trust the word of a lying little savage like you?,I'm no liar.
1411,How? And don't tell me to put a spear in your hand.,"There are other ways to serve, my lord."

1414,"What do you want then, other than your miserable life?",What all free people want. My freedom.
1415,Why? Why would a stranger-,You are everything he will never have. Your horse eats better than his children. It doesn't matter now. He's dead.
1416,And where are you going?,I have something for you from Prince Theon.
1417,What?,Me. He says I'm to make the rounds. And keep you warm.
1418,The Spice King refuses me because I'm a bad investment. The Silk King won't support me because of his business with the Lannisters. Why offend his best customer? And the Copper King offers me a single ship on the condition that I lie with him for a night. Does he think I will whore myself for a boat?,"When I came to this city, I had nothing. Truly nothing. I slept by the docks. And when I could find work loading the ships, I would eat. If not, I dreamed of food. Today, I am the richest man in Qarth. Do you think the path from poverty to wealth is always pure and honorable? I have done many things, Khaleesi, that a righteous man would condemn. And here I am, with no regrets."
1419,"When I came to this city, I had nothing. Truly nothing. I slept by the docks. And when I could find work loading the ships, I would eat. If not, I dreamed of food. Today, I am the richest man in Qarth. Do you think the path from poverty to wealth is always pure and honorable? I have done many things, Khaleesi, that a righteous man would condemn. And here I am, with no regrets.","Bar the gates. Ring the bells. Slowly, Khaleesi."
1420,Where are they? Where are my dragons?,"A cripple? You let a cripple escape? The boy can't walk, but somehow he slipped past you?"
1421,"A cripple? You let a cripple escape? The boy can't walk, but somehow he slipped past you?",The giant must have took him.
1422,"The giant? Hodor? Oh, that's all right, then. You let a halfwit escape with a cripple. And Rickon, too? The little one?","Gone, along with the wildling woman. The one you were fucking."
1423,"Come on, find the scent. Where they going?",Halt!
1424,Enjoying your first hunt?,"So far, hunting seems very similar to riding, my lord."
1425,Did you pull a knife on me in the night?,What's the matter? Can't be the first time you pressed your bone against a woman's arse.
1426,What's the matter? Can't be the first time you pressed your bone against a woman's arse.,Let's move.
1427,"It is the first time. How old are you, boy?",I'm a man of the Night's Watch.
1428,"What, stones? Or bone?",Neither. Both.
1429,"I heard they get all swollen and bruised if you don't use them. Of course, maybe that's just what the lads say when they want me feeling sorry for them. As if I'd feel sorry for them. Are there no girl crows?","There are no women of the Night's Watch, no."
1430,So the lads just do it with each other?,No.
1431,Never?,Never. We swore an oath.
1432,"You have sheep at the Wall? With your hands, then? No wonder you're all so miserable.",Would you please shut up?
1433,Would you please shut up?,"Would you please shut up? You think you're better than me, crow. I'm a free woman."
1434,"Would you please shut up? You think you're better than me, crow. I'm a free woman.",You're a free woman?
1435,You're a free woman?,"I might be your prisoner, but I'm a free woman."
1436,And you think you're free? You swore some stupid oath and now you can never touch a girl.,It was my choice to say the words.
1437,So you don't like girls?,Of course I like girls.
1438,"Invade your lands? Wildlings raid our lands all the time. Some of them tried to kill my little brother, a crippled boy!",They're not your lands! We've been here the whole time. You lot came along and just put up a big wall and said it was yours.
1439,So why are you fighting us?,"Go on. Now I want you to tell me what happened. Come on, this way. Come on, speak up. Speak up."
1440,"Killing them isn't the problem. It's finding them. Have you gone soft, Clegane? I always thought you had a talent for violence.","Burn the villages, burn the farms. Let them know what it means to choose the wrong side."
1441,Mmm. Is that mutton?,"Yes, my lord."
1442,Leave it. Are you hungry?,No.
1443,Have you ever lost before?,Do you think I'd be in my position if I had lost a war?
1444,Do you think I'd be in my position if I had lost a war?,"But this is the one I'll be remembered for. The War of the Five Kings, they're calling it. My legacy will be determined in the coming months."
1445,Do you know what legacy means? It's what you pass down to your children and your children's children. It's what remains of you when you're gone. Harren the Black thought this castle would be his legacy. The greatest fortress ever built.,"The tallest towers, the strongest walls. The Great Hall had thirty-five hearths. Thirty-five. Can you imagine? Look at it now. A blasted ruin. Do you know what happened?"
1446,"The tallest towers, the strongest walls. The Great Hall had thirty-five hearths. Thirty-five. Can you imagine? Look at it now. A blasted ruin. Do you know what happened?",Dragons?
1447,Dragons?,Yes. Dragons happened.
1448,Mmm?,"It wasn't just Aegon riding his dragon. It was Rhaenys and Visenya, too."
1449,"Correct. A student of history, are you?",Rhaenys rode Meraxes. Visenya rode Vhagar.
1450,"Hmm. She's a heroine of yours, I take it?",Aren't most girls more interested in the pretty maidens from the songs? Jonquil with the flowers in her hair?
1451,Aren't most girls more interested in the pretty maidens from the songs? Jonquil with the flowers in her hair?,Most girls are idiots.
1452,You remind me of my daughter. Where did you learn all this stuff about Visenya and her Valyrian steel sword?,From my father.
1453,"Have you met many stonemasons, my lord?","Careful now, girl. I enjoy you, but be careful. Take that back to the kitchen. Eat what you want."
1454,You're too smart for your own good. Has anyone told you that?,Yes.
1455,Brave? A dog doesn't need courage to chase off rats.,Does it give you joy to scare people?
1456,Does it give you joy to scare people?,"No, it gives me joy to kill people."
1457,Is that what he told you? He lied. Killing is the sweetest thing there is.,Why are you always so hateful?
1458,Why are you always so hateful?,You'll be glad of the hateful things I do someday when you're queen and I'm all that stands between you and your beloved king.
1459,Nothing? They're more valuable than anything in the world.,Shall we look inside my vault and see what selling your dragons would buy me I cannot buy already? We will get them back.
1460,Shall we look inside my vault and see what selling your dragons would buy me I cannot buy already? We will get them back.,"There is no we, so why would you help me get them back?"
1461,"There is no we, so why would you help me get them back?","I took you under my protection in front of the rulers of my city. A man is what others say he is and no more. If they say that Xaro Xhoan Daxos is a liar, my word is worth nothing. I cannot let this thing happen to you under my roof."
1462,And what did she say?,"She admired your spirit, Your Grace."
1463,And what then?,"She, uh..."
1464,Is there room for Ser Alton?,Does he need to lie down?
1465,Does he need to lie down?,Have the men build him a new pen. Put him in with the Kingslayer for now. Have your boy watch over them.
1466,Your Grace. A minute of your time?,I've been treating your wounded men.
1467,You're riding to the Crag to negotiate a surrender?,Yes.
1468,"I'm looking at spending the rest of my life being treated like a fool and a eunuch by my own people. Ask yourself, is there anything I wouldn't do to stop that from happening? The hounds will find the scent again. I'll beat them until they do. I'll whip every man here until I have both those boys in hand. And once I've got them, the pampered little shits It's better to be cruel than weak.",Prince Theon.
1469,Where are they?,"Who, m'lord?"
1470,"Who, m'lord?",The Stark boys. Where are they?
1471,The Stark boys. Where are they?,I don't know. I seen no one.
1472,As soon as I heard. Do you know anything?,Irri is dead.
1473,Doreah?,"We can't find her. She must be dead, too. I led my people out of the Red Waste and into the slaughterhouse."
1474,"These people""?",They are not to be trusted.
1475,"And who is to be trusted? Who are my people? The Targaryens? I only knew one, my brother, and he would have let a thousand men rape me if it had got him the crown. The Dothraki? Most of them turned on me the day that Khal Drogo fell from his horse.",Your people are in Westeros.
1476,And then what? They'll pray for my return? They'll wave dragon banners and shout my name? That's what my brother believed and he was a fool.,"You are not your brother. Trust me, Khaleesi."
1477,"There it is. ""Trust me. "" And it's you I should trust, Ser Jorah? Only you? I don't need trust any longer. I don't want it and I don't have room for it.",You are too young to be so-
1478,How long till we get back to your crows?,We're close.
1479,"What, a day? A half-day? You don't know, do you? Do you even know where they are?",What do you think they'll say when they hear about you and me?
1480,What do you think they'll say when they hear about you and me?,Nothing happened between you and me.
1481,"I swear it, Old Master King Crow, ser, we were only close together for warmth. And then I felt it, right up against me backside like a club. I can show you the bruise on me tailbone. And before I knew what was where, his his Well, it was all out in the open, all angry as you like. And I didn't want to want it, but oh, I did! And he spread me legs and ruined. The shame of it. Now I can never marry a perfumed lord. What will me poor savage father say?",Turn back around.
1482,"What, right here in the muck?",I'll keep you warm enough.
1483,Are you that afraid of it?,That's enough.
1484,Where are you going?,To tell Her Grace.
1485,You'll say nothing to anyone. Do you understand?,"Your mother might have prepared you. You flowered, my dear. No more."
1486,In what way?,I thought it would be less messy.
1487,You're a woman now. Do you have any idea what that means?,I'm fit to bear children for the king?
1488,I'm fit to bear children for the king?,"A prospect that once delighted you, bringing little princes and princesses into the world, the greatest honor for a queen."
1489,His Grace was not with you?,"Robert was hunting. That was his custom. Whenever my time was near, my royal husband would flee to the trees with his huntsmen and his hounds. And when he returned, he would present me with some pelts or a stag's head, and I would present him with a baby. Not that I wanted him there, mind you. I had Grand Maester Pycelle, an army of midwives, and I had my brother. When they told Jaime he wasn't allowed in the birthing room, he smiled and asked which one of them proposed to keep him out. Joffrey will show you no such devotion."
1490,"But shouldn't I love Joffrey, Your Grace?","You can try, little dove."
1491,Who did you say your mother was again?,Cinda Lannister.
1492,Is she the fat one?,"Well, perhaps she's gotten a little larger than she-"
1493,When?,"The tournament, the day of Willem Frey's wedding."
1494,I went to Willem Frey's wedding?,You did. Your squire had gotten so drunk the night before that he threw up.
1495,He threw up on his horse on the way to the tourney grounds. What was his name?,Bryan.
1496,You really remember?,"You knew when you were needed and when to go away. It's a rare talent. Most of my squires, they mean well, but young men with big jobs, they tend to overdo them."
1497,You were saying?,I- Never mind. It's embarrassing.
1498,More embarrassing than being chained to a post covered in your own shit?,"I remember everything about that day, your helmet, your horse, the rake lines in the dirt along the list, where the sun was in the sky when you knocked Balon from his horse, and the dent in your shield when you handed it back to me. I'll remember it all until I die. That was the best day of my life. And I remember being on the field after it was over. All the competitors were done. I was the last one out there. And I couldn't leave. I couldn't bring myself to go and sit with my family at a table so far on the edge of the feast you could barely even see the bride. And I couldn't bear to tell them what it had been like squiring for you, when I knew that they could never have the faintest idea what I was talking about."
1499,"How could you? Sorry, I I didn't mean to doubt you.","It's just that I, I was sixteen once. I also had to replace someone's squire on short notice."
1500,Which knight was it?,Barristan Selmy. The fight against the Kingswood Outlaws. Before your time.
1501,What was he like?,"He was a painter. A painter who only used red. I couldn't imagine being able to fight like that, not back then. And to help him do that, to be a part of something that perfect. I don't need to explain how that felt, not to you."
1502,Did you squire for him again?,"No. I didn't have your gift. He couldn't take a step without stepping on me. I was awful, a complete liability. Until one of the outlaws decided to take on a sixteen-year-old squire."
1503,And?,"Good prisoners breed good jailers, apparently. The Starks are very careful."
1504,What is it?,It's actually quite simple.
1505,You have them? Where are they?,Draw your sword. See what your steel is worth. You want to please the Mother of Dragons.
1506,Where are the dragons?,"Will you betray her again, Jorah the Andal?"
1507,"Will you betray her again, Jorah the Andal?",Will you betray her again?
1508,Will you betray her again?,Never.
1509,No one is calling you a thief. Who is she to accuse us?,"Please, they're my children. I'm begging you."
1510,Begging us? It wasn't very long ago you were threatening us.,"Without me, the dragons will die."
1511,How?,I will take you to the House of the Undying where I have put them.
1512,You have my dragons?,"When I learned you were coming to our city, I made an arrangement with the King of Qarth. He procured them for me."
1513,"An upstart and a charlatan? Empires have been built by less. Those on the margins often come to control the center, and those in the center make room for them, willingly or otherwise.","The Mother of Dragons will be with her babies. She will give them her love and they will thrive by her side, forever."
1514,"Where will you run to, Daenerys Stormborn? Your dragons wait for you in the House of the Undying. Come see them.",Lady Stark!
1515,What is it?,They caught the Kingslayer.
1516,"You will strike me down? Have you forgotten me, ser? I am the widow of your liege, Lord Eddard Stark. I am the mother of your king!",And where is our king now?
1517,And where is our king now?,You know very well.
1518,Treason? How can it be treason to kill Lannisters?,"I understand your grief, my lord, better than most, I understand it. But in the name of my son, the King in the North, stand down."
1519,Since when do you light your own candles?,Since I decided that I can't stand to look at any of my handmaidens for another instant.
1520,How many times can you read one raven scroll?,"Stannis Baratheon's fleet has been spotted sailing north past Tarth, two hundred ships."
1521,"Rain fire on them from above."" You're quoting Father, aren't you?","Why not? He has a good mind for strategy, doesn't he?"
1522,"Why not? He has a good mind for strategy, doesn't he?","Call it tactics, not strategy. But, yes, he does have a good mind for it. The best mind, some would say. Sadly, he's not here. It's just you, me and Joffrey, the Lord of the Seven Kingdoms and Protector of the Realm."
1523,Did you?,I was wrong. If we can't control him
1524,Do you think I haven't tried? He doesn't listen to me.,It's hard to put a leash on a dog once you've put a crown on its head.
1525,"Robert was a drunken fool, but he didn't enjoy cruelty. Sometimes I wonder. What? If this is the price for what we've done, for our sins.",Sins?
1526,Sins?,"The Targaryens wed brother and sister for hundreds of years, I know. That's what Jaime and I would say to each other in our moments of doubt. It's what I told Ned Stark when he was stupid enough to confront me. Half the Targaryens went mad, didn't they? What's the saying? ""Every time a Targaryen is born, the Gods flip a coin."""
1527,"The Targaryens wed brother and sister for hundreds of years, I know. That's what Jaime and I would say to each other in our moments of doubt. It's what I told Ned Stark when he was stupid enough to confront me. Half the Targaryens went mad, didn't they? What's the saying? ""Every time a Targaryen is born, the Gods flip a coin.""","You've beaten the odds. Tommen and Myrcella are good, decent children, both of them."
1528,Then why wait?,We're sworn to the king.
1529,"So is saving Lannisters, yeah?","Back off, you."
1530,"Your son returns at dawn, my lady?",So they say.
1531,"The Kingslayer won't last the night. The more they drink, the angrier they'll get. And when the Karstarks draw their swords Who wants to die defending a Lannister?",Come.
1532,"Come to say goodbye, Lady Stark? I believe it's my last night in this world. Is that a woman?",Do you hear them out there? They want your head.
1533,Do you hear them out there? They want your head.,Old Lord Karstark doesn't seem to like me.
1534,Oh. Oh. Was he the one on guard duty? He was in my way. Any knight would have done the same.,You are no knight. You have forsaken every vow you ever took.
1535,"So many vows. They make you swear and swear. Defend the king, obey the king, obey your father, protect the innocent, defend the weak. But what if your father despises the king? What if the king massacres the innocent? It's too much. No matter what you do, you're forsaking one vow or another. Where did you find this beast?","She is a truer knight than you will ever be, Kingslayer."
1536,"Do you know, I've never been with any woman but Cersei. So in my own way, I have more honor than poor old dead Ned. What was the name of that bastard he fathered?",Brienne.
1537,"No, that wasn't it. Snow, a bastard from the North. Now, when When good old Ned came home with some whore's baby, did you pretend to love it? No. You're not very good at pretending. You're an honest woman. You hated that boy, didn't you? How could you not hate him? The walking, talking reminder that the honorable Lord Eddard Stark fucked another woman.",Your sword.
1538,What are you doing? What have you done?,"If there are any who still question whether your new lord means what he says, here is the answer to your question."
1539,What envy?,You should be proud of your brother's achievement. I took the great castle of Winterfell with twenty men.
1540,"You're a great warrior. I saw the bodies above your gates. Which one gave you the tougher fight, the cripple or the six-year-old?","I treated the Stark boys with honor, and they repaid me with treachery."
1541,You treated them with honor? By butchering them?,Before I had to kill them- I treated them-
1542,Then you made them prisoners in their home and they ran away. Is that treachery? I'd call it bravery.,They made me a promise
1543,Your little boy prisoners made you a promise and you got mad when they broke it? Are you the dumbest cunt alive?,Don't call me
1544,A cunt. A dumb cunt who killed the only two Starks in Winterfell. You know how valuable those boys were?,"If I hadn't killed them, the Northerners would think me weak."
1545,You haven't brought enough men. How am I supposed to defend Winterfell with just this lot?,You're not. I've come to bring you home. Father wants a word.
1546,Is this a joke? Winterfell is the heart of the North.,"Aye, it is, hundreds of miles from the sea. We're islanders, baby brother. Had you forgotten that? Our power comes from our ships. And now that you've decorated your walls with the bodies of the Stark boys, every man in the North wants to see you hanged. When Robb Stark finds out-"
1547,"Aye, it is, hundreds of miles from the sea. We're islanders, baby brother. Had you forgotten that? Our power comes from our ships. And now that you've decorated your walls with the bodies of the Stark boys, every man in the North wants to see you hanged. When Robb Stark finds out-",He won't find out. We've killed all the ravens. We have all the horses. I've taken Winterfell. And I will keep Winterfell.
1548,"You were a terrible baby, do you know that? Bawling all the time, never sleeping. And one night, you just wouldn't shut up, screaming like a dying pig. I walked over to your crib, I looked down at you. I wanted to strangle you. And you looked up at me and you stopped screaming. You smiled at me. Don't die so far from the sea.","I've brought you a present, Lord of Bones."
1549,What does Mance want with a dead man's bastard?,I don't know. I think he'll want to decide for himself.
1550,The others?,"When you didn't come back, we went looking for you. We found your tracks fast enough. But they found us before we found you."
1551,Is she beautiful?,I've never met her.
1552,What's her name?,"Frey, I suppose. I don't know her first name."
1553,And you're marrying her for a bridge?,An important bridge.
1554,"He once told me that being a lord is like being a father, except you have thousands of children and you worry about all of them. The farmers plowing the fields are yours to protect. The charwomen scrubbing the floors, yours to protect. The soldiers you order into battle. He told me he woke with fear in the morning and went to bed with fear in the night. I didn't believe him. I asked him, ""How can a man be brave if he's afraid?"" ""That is the only time a man can be brave,"" he told me.",I wish I could have met him.
1555,And you? You think I'm fighting this war so they'll sing songs about me? I want to go home. I want the men following me to go home.,Then why don't you?
1556,Then why don't you?,Because we'll never be safe until the Lannisters are defeated. And because I believe in justice.
1557,How? How?,Tell me this isn't true.
1558,Why?,For the girls.
1559,"I lost one son fighting by your son's side. I lost another to the Kingslayer, strangled with a chain. You commit treason because your children are prisoners? I would carve out my heart and offer it to the Father, if he would let my sons wake from their graves and step into a prison cell.","I grieve for your sons, my lord."
1560,Robb. How many men did we send in pursuit of the Kingslayer?,"Forty, Your Grace."
1561,"You're much uglier in daylight. What's your name? I'm Jaime Lannister of Casterly Rock, son of Tywin.",A captive knight has a right to know his captor's identity.
1562,"Tarth, Tarth, Tarth. Crescent moons and starbursts. Lord Selwyn Tarth. Your father. Do you have any brothers and sisters, my lady? It's a long way to King's Landing. Might as well get to know one another.",Have you known many men? I suppose not. Women? Horses? Ah.
1563,Have you known many men? I suppose not. Women? Horses? Ah.,"I didn't mean to give offense, my lady. Forgive me."
1564,Why do you hate me so much? Have I ever harmed you?,"You've harmed others, those you were sworn to protect, the weak, the innocent."
1565,Has anyone ever told you you're as boring as you are ugly?,You will not provoke me to anger.
1566,I already have. Look at you. You're ready to chop my head off. Do you think you could? Do you think you could beat me in a fair fight?,I've never seen you fight.
1567,Do you take me for an idiot? In!,"I took you for a fighter, a man Pardon. Woman of honor. Was I wrong? You're afraid."
1568,"I took you for a fighter, a man Pardon. Woman of honor. Was I wrong? You're afraid.","Maybe one day we'll find out, Kingslayer."
1569,Surrender the Iron Throne?,Better than seeing their heads mounted on the city gates. Stannis will execute them all.
1570,Who killed Ser Amory?,I don't know! Please!
1571,Where's Jaqen?,"Don't care. Where's your stick now, bitch? I promised to fuck you with it."
1572,"Don't care. Where's your stick now, bitch? I promised to fuck you with it.","Come on, time to kill some wolves."
1573,How would I know?,I need him now. Lord Tywin's marching tonight.
1574,You need him?,He's helping me.
1575,Where?,Ow!
1576,What do you want with him anyway?,"Mance is gonna march on the Wall. When he does, one brother inside his army will be worth a thousand fighting against it."
1577,What?,How does it feel knowing those men all died so you could skip through the snow with your little savage girl?
1578,How does it feel knowing those men all died so you could skip through the snow with your little savage girl?,I didn't.
1579,Do you have to do that here?,I like to keep me hands clean.
1580,"Yes, but do you have to do it here?",You should start wearing the gold cloak.
1581,What?,What?
1582,What?,What? What? Why are you staring at me?
1583,What? What? Why are you staring at me?,You don't want me cleaning me nails. You don't want me looking your way. Why am I here?
1584,You don't want me cleaning me nails. You don't want me looking your way. Why am I here?,To help me plan the defense of King's Landing.
1585,And one of these explains how to beat him?,"An History of the Great Sieges of Westeros. "" By Archmaester Shevelathin. Shevelatesh."
1586,My Lord Hand. Commander. I must compliment you on the gold cloaks' performance these last few weeks. Did you know there has been a marked drop in thievery?,I did not know. And how did you accomplish this marked drop in thievery?
1587,I did not know. And how did you accomplish this marked drop in thievery?,Me and the lads rounded up all the known thieves.
1588,For questioning?,No. It's just the unknown thieves we need to worry about now.
1589,"Aye, we talked about it. Have you ever been in a city under siege? Maybe this part's not in your books. See, it's not the fighting that kills most people. It's the starving. Foodo s worth more than gold. Noble ladies sell their diamonds for a sack of potatoes. Things get bad enough, the poor start eating each other.","The thieves, they love a siege. Soon as the gates are sealed, they steal all the food. By the time it's all over, they're the richest men in town."
1590,"And if Stannis does attack the Mud Gate, what is our plan?",We could throw books at his men.
1591,What do we have?,Pig shit.
1592,Where do you think Jon is right now?,He went off with the Halfhand. He didn't come back. A betting man would go with dead.
1593,What in seven hells is that?,The First Men made these marks. Help me with it.
1594,Dragonglass?,The maesters call it obsidian.
1595,Why would a brother hide it here?,I expect it's 'cause he wanted somebody to find it.
1596,Where were you?,A man has patrol duty.
1597,How long after I give you the name does it take you to kill someone?,"A minute, an hour, a month. Death is certain, the time is not."
1598,And you'll kill them? Anybody?,"By the Seven New Gods and the Old Gods beyond counting, I swear it."
1599,A girl gives a man his own name?,That's right.
1600,Please?,I'll un-name you.
1601,Excellent lamprey pie. Were you slaving away in the kitchen all day? I hear Joffrey plans on fighting. An inspiration for the troops. The young king in his shining armor fighting to defend the capital against the wicked old rebel.,He's only a boy.
1602,"What is he, seventeen? Remember Jaime at seventeen?","Better than you. Some men have a gift for this sort of thing, some don't. His place is not on the battlefield."
1603,Do you think I'm an idiot?,"No, I'd say you possess above-average intelligence."
1604,He'll have his Kingsguard protecting him. He has the finest armor gold can buy. He needs to be out there. The men will fight more fiercely seeing their king fighting beside them instead of hiding behind his mother's skirts. Any dessert?,Do you know why Varys is so dangerous?
1605,Do you know why Varys is so dangerous?,Because he has thousands of spies in his employ. Because he knows everything we do before we do it.
1606,Why are you smiling?,Because I'm happy.
1607,And why are you happy?,Because I have your little whore.
1608,"Such a droll little fellow. Tell me, have you married this one yet? No? Good. Father will be so pleased.",Why do you care who I fuck?
1609,Why do you care who I fuck?,"Because a Lannister always pays her debts. You stole my only daughter, you plot to have Joffrey killed."
1610,"For what? Your skill in battle? Pretty thing, your whore. Lovely body. The bruises will heal in time.",Where did you find her?
1611,Where did you find her?,"Varys isn't the only one who hears whispers. Really, a Lannister lion necklace? You need to hide your secret whores more carefully."
1612,"Varys isn't the only one who hears whispers. Really, a Lannister lion necklace? You need to hide your secret whores more carefully.",You've forgotten the most important thing about whores.
1613,"Oh? Well, you're the expert. Tell me.","You don't buy them, you only rent them."
1614,"You're usually a better liar, baby brother. This one you like. You like her very much. Could it be love? Don't worry, she'll be treated gently enough. Unless Joffrey is hurt. And then every wound he suffers, she'll suffer, too. And if he dies, there isn't a man alive who could devise a more painful death for your little cunt.",And how do I know you haven't killed her already?
1615,And how do I know you haven't killed her already?,"Would you like to see her? I thought you might. Ser Mandon, bring in my brother's whore."
1616,"Would you like to see her? I thought you might. Ser Mandon, bring in my brother's whore.",I'm sorry they hurt you. You must be brave.
1617,I've been waiting all night. What is wrong?,You're beautiful.
1618,Then why do you look sad?,We have to be more careful.
1619,I would kill for you. Do you know that? I expect I'll have to before this is over. You're mine.,I'm yours.
1620,Still no word?,We've sent a dozen ravens. None have returned. My bastard is only a few days from Winterfell. Once he captures the castle
1621,How are you?,How am I? I've had to arrest my mother. The Lannisters have my sisters. The man I considered my closest friend has seized my home and my brothers. I'm fighting a war and I don't know if I should march south or north.
1622,How am I? I've had to arrest my mother. The Lannisters have my sisters. The man I considered my closest friend has seized my home and my brothers. I'm fighting a war and I don't know if I should march south or north.,I'm sorry. It was a stupid question. I'm sorry.
1623,What kind do you want to be?,I don't know. The good kind. Most kings grew up as princes. They spend their whole lives preparing for the crown. I was raised to be Lord of Winterfell.
1624,How did you go from reciting Valyrian poetry to sawing off men's feet?,"When I was twelve, my mother and father went to a wedding. Weddings in Volantis last for days, you know. And they left me with my little brother. The second afternoon they were gone was the hottest day in the three-year summer. We couldn't bear to be inside, so we ran down to the Rhoyne. Every child in Volantis was in the Rhoyne that day. The rich, the poor, we were all there. Naked, screaming, racing to the little islands. Drummers were playing for coppers on the east bank. I was treading water, talking to a friend, when I realized I hadn't seen my brother. I called his name. Then I started screaming his name. And then I saw him floating face down. My heart just stopped. I was I dragged him from the water. My friend helped me, I think. I don't even remember. He was so little. Then we pulled him onto the riverbank. And I screamed at him and I shook him. And he was dead. Just dead. A man ran over. He had a fish tattoo on his face. In Volantis, the slaves have tattoos. So you know what they are without having to talk to them. And this man worked on a fishing boat. And he pushed me out of the way. You have to understand, for a slave to push a highborn girl, that's death for the man, a terrible death. But he pushed me out of the way, and he started pressing on my brother's chest again and again and again, until my brother spat out half of the Rhoyne and cried out. And the man cradled his head and told him to be calm. I decided two things that day. I would not waste my years planning dances and masquerades with the other noble ladies. And when I came of age, I would never live in a slave city again. I'm sorry, Your Grace. You told me of your problems and I've blathered on."
1625,Shut up. What did you bring?,Shut up. What did you bring?
1626,Shut up. What did you bring?,The cheese could be better. I did get some nice sausages.
1627,What did he want us to do about those guards?,"He didn't say. He just said, ""Walk through the gates."""
1628,What about the guards?,He didn't say anything about the guards.
1629,"What, he left that bit out? It's a pretty important part, don't you think?",We have to trust him.
1630,Trust him? You trusted him to fight with us when you set him free and he ran.,I want to go back to the kitchens.
1631,Will it hold?,"Can't make promises for the wind, Your Grace."
1632,Do you? Why?,My father was a crabber.
1633,And?,"Well, sons of lords don't like to break bread with sons of crabbers. Our hands stink."
1634,And where were those lords when Storm's End starved?,Many fought bravely for your brother. Many fought for the Mad King.
1635,No? Robert did. He gave Storm's End to Renly after the war. Renly never fought a day in his life.,He was only a boy.
1636,Then why'd he give him Storm's End?,"First, we ate the horses. We weren't riding anywhere, not with the castle surrounded. We couldn't feed them, so fine, the horses. Then the cats. Never liked cats. So fine. I do like dogs. Good animals. Loyal. But we ate them. Then the rats. The night before you slipped through, I thought my wife was dying. She couldn't speak anymore, she was so frail. And then you made it through the lines. Slipped right through in your little black sailboat with your onions."
1637,"To strike? My dear nephew, you do see these men preparing the walls for siege? You do understand Stannis Baratheon sails this way?","If my Uncle Stannis lands on the shores of King's Landing, I'll ride out to greet him."
1638,What do you want? Tell me.,"If we're going to play, you'll have to start."
1639,"You're quite good at being Hand, you know? Jon Arryn and Ned Stark were good men. Honorable men. But they disdained the game and those who played. You enjoy the game.",I do. Last thing I expected.
1640,"The Lord of Light wants his enemies burned, the Drowned God wants them drowned. Why are all the gods such vicious cunts? Where is the god of tits and wine?","In the Summer Isles, they worship a fertility goddess with sixteen teats."
1641,Astapor?,We cannot stay here.
1642,And what of my magic? You saw me step into the fire. You watched the witch burn. What did the flames do to me? Do you remember?,"Until my last breath, I will remember. After I have forgotten my mother's face."
1643,What's this?,Gold for the farmer. For his trouble.
1644,Who was that out there hung up at the gates?,Must have been the farmer's boys.
1645,He killed them and burned them and passed them off as the little lords?,They mustn't know. Bran would blame himself.
1646,But not over them?,"Over all of us. The people of King's Landing did not choose the false king, Joffrey Baratheon. They will be glad to see his head on a spike."
1647,"Are you afraid, my lion?","If the city falls, Stannis will burn every Lannister he can find. Of course I'm afraid."
1648,I have so far. Do you remember what you said when you met me in your tent? That I should make love to you like it was your last day on this earth.,"As you know, Your Grace, it is not only the sworn duty of a maester to carry out the wishes of the house he serves, but also to offer guidance and counsel in times of war."
1649,You brought me something?,"Yes. Essence of nightshade is as dangerous as it is efficacious. A single drop in a cup of wine suffices to soothe ragged nerves. Three drops will bring on a deep and dreamless sleep. Ten drops, however-"
1650,Lannisters! Where'd you learn the Lannister song?,Drunk Lannisters.
1651,And I like your nose. How many times you break it?,"Well, now let's see. First time, I was five. My mam smacked me with an iron poker."
1652,You think you're a hard man?,I know it.
1653,And quicker. Eh?,Your Lord Imp's going to miss you.
1654,One more drink before the war? Shall we?,"I've always hated the bells. They ring for horror. A dead king, a city under siege."
1655,"Exactly. Podrick, is that it?","Is that it?"" Nice touch. As if you don't know the name of every boy in town."
1656,"Is that it?"" Nice touch. As if you don't know the name of every boy in town.",I'm not entirely sure what you're suggesting.
1657,Do you trust him?,"Oddly enough, I do."
1658,What of it?,"You don't believe in the old powers, my lord?"
1659,"You don't believe in the old powers, my lord?","Blood spells, curses, shape-shifting. What do you think?"
1660,"Blood spells, curses, shape-shifting. What do you think?",I think you believe in what you see and in what those you trust have seen. You probably don't entirely trust me.
1661,I've never known bells to mean surrender. They want to play music with us? Let's play. Drums.,Drums!
1662,"I know what ""in"" means. Do you know how to use that?","I chopped wood once. No, I watched my brother chopping wood."
1663,"Oh, are we friends now?",Of course we are. Just because I pay you for your services doesn't diminish our friendship.
1664,Will you?,Just as I pray for the king's.
1665,Will you slay him yourself?,If Stannis is fool enough to come near me.
1666,So you'll be outside the gates fighting in the vanguard?,A king doesn't discuss battle plans with stupid girls.
1667,Where's our fleet?,On the way.
1668,Why isn't it here now? They're coming.,"Hound, tell the Hand that his king has asked him a question."
1669,Where are their ships?,It was wise to attack at night. We took them by surprise.
1670,Why would she be jealous?,Sansa.
1671,"I was wondering where our little dove had flown. You look pale, child. Is your red flower still blooming?",Yes.
1672,"Fitting, isn't it? The men will bleed out there and you will bleed in here. Pour Lady Sansa some wine.","I'm not thirsty, Your Grace."
1673,So? I didn't offer you water.,What's he doing here?
1674,What's he doing here?,"Ser llyn? He's here to defend us. When the axes smash down those doors, you may be glad to have him."
1675,"Ser llyn? He's here to defend us. When the axes smash down those doors, you may be glad to have him.",But we have guards to defend us.
1676,What are you doing? We need to attack them.,Boulders ready!
1677,There's only one ship. Where are the rest of them? Where are the rest of them?,There's only one ship.
1678,What are you doing?,Praying.
1679,"You're perfect, aren't you? Praying. What are you praying for?",For the gods to have mercy on us all.
1680,Oh. On all of us?,"Yes, Your Grace."
1681,Even me?,"Of course, Your Grace."
1682,Even Joffrey?,Joffrey is my-
1683,Your father doesn't believe in the gods?,"He believes in them, he just doesn't like them very much."
1684,And if the city should fall?,"You'd like that, wouldn't you? The Red Keep should hold for a time, long enough for me to go to the walls and yield to Lord Stannis in person. If it were anyone else outside those gates, I might have hoped for a private audience, but this is Stannis Baratheon. I'd have a better chance of seducing his horse."
1685,"You'd like that, wouldn't you? The Red Keep should hold for a time, long enough for me to go to the walls and yield to Lord Stannis in person. If it were anyone else outside those gates, I might have hoped for a private audience, but this is Stannis Baratheon. I'd have a better chance of seducing his horse.","Have I shocked you, little dove? Tears aren't a woman's only weapon. The best one's between your legs. Learn how to use it. Drink."
1686,"Have I shocked you, little dove? Tears aren't a woman's only weapon. The best one's between your legs. Learn how to use it. Drink.","Do you have any notion of what happens when a city is sacked? No, you wouldn't, would you? If the city falls, these fine women should be in for a bit of a rape. Half of them will have bastards in their bellies come the morning. You'll be glad of your red flower then. When a man's blood is up, anything with tits looks good. A precious thing like you will look very, very good. A slice of cake just waiting to be eaten."
1687,"Do you have any notion of what happens when a city is sacked? No, you wouldn't, would you? If the city falls, these fine women should be in for a bit of a rape. Half of them will have bastards in their bellies come the morning. You'll be glad of your red flower then. When a man's blood is up, anything with tits looks good. A precious thing like you will look very, very good. A slice of cake just waiting to be eaten.","More pressure! Pull! Pull! That's it, men! Pull! Pull!"
1688,Better. You learn fast. How long have you been in Lady Sansa's service?,"A few weeks, Your Grace."
1689,When did you leave Lorath?,I had a Lorathi handmaiden once.
1690,But she was a nobleman's daughter. You're not. When did you come to Westeros?,"Ten years ago, Your Grace."
1691,"From Lorathi commoner to the Red Keep in ten years, all without learning how to curtsy. I imagine that's a very interesting story. What's your name?","Shae, Your Grace."
1692,What news?,"The Imp has set the river afire. Hundreds of ships are burning, maybe more. Stannis' fleet destroyed, but But But his troops have landed outside the city walls."
1693,Where is Joffrey?,On the battlements with Lord Tyrion.
1694,What?,The king's presence is good for morale.
1695,Not here?,With the women and children? Do you want him to be mocked as a coward for the rest of his life?
1696,With the women and children? Do you want him to be mocked as a coward for the rest of his life?,"No, but I-"
1697,"When I told you about Ser llyn earlier, I lied. Do you want to hear the truth? You want to know why he's really here? He's here for us. Stannis may take the city, he may take the throne, but he will not take us alive.",Help me!
1698,"Can I get you some iced milk and a nice bowl of raspberries, too?","Eat shit, dwarf."
1699,"If you won't defend your own city, why should they?",What would you have me do?
1700,What would you have me do?,Lead. Get down there and lead your people against the invaders who want to kill them.
1701,What did my mother say exactly? Did she have urgent business with me?,"She did not say, Your Grace."
1702,Where is the king? Why isn't he with us?,Who are we fighting for?
1703,Who are we fighting for?,Who leads us?
1704,Who leads us?,I'll lead the attack. I'll lead the attack!
1705,What are you talking about?,"Pod, my helmet. Ser Mandon, you will bear the king's banner. Men, form up. Men Men! They say I'm half a man. But what does that make the lot of you?"
1706,"Pod, my helmet. Ser Mandon, you will bear the king's banner. Men, form up. Men Men! They say I'm half a man. But what does that make the lot of you?",The only way out is through the gates. And they're at the gates.
1707,Where is my son?,I want to escort him back to the battle.
1708,Why do I care what you want? Bring me-,Now listen to me-
1709,"Don't be afraid. The queen has raised the drawbridge. This is the safest place we can be. Joffrey's not hurt. He's fighting bravely. His knights have rallied behind him. They will save the city. Shall we sing a hymn? Gentle mother, fount of mercy...","Save our sons from war, we pray."
1710,What are you doing here?,Not here for long. I'm going.
1711,Where?,"Someplace that isn't burning. North, might be. Could be."
1712,What about the king?,He can die just fine on his own.
1713,I'll keep you safe. Do you want to go home?,I'll be safe here. Stannis won't hurt me.
1714,No one's going to hurt you. I'll tell you a story. You know the one about the mother lion and her little cub? They lived in the woods.,The Kingswood?
1715,The Kingswood?,"Yes, my love. In the Kingswood, there lived a mother and her cub. She loved him very much. But there were other things that lived in the woods. Evil things."
1716,Like what?,Like stags.
1717,"And the cub said, ""Will I be strong and fierce like my father?""","Yes,"" said his mother. ""You will be strong and fierce just like your father."
1718,"And who are you,"" the proud lord said / ""That I must bow so low?"" / ""Only a cat of a different coat / That's all the truth I know / In a coat of gold or a coat of red / A lion still has claws / And mine are long and sharp, my lord / As long and sharp as yours"" / And so he spoke, and so he spoke / That Lord of Castamere / But now the rains weep o'er his hall / With no one there to hear / Yes, now the rains weep o'er his hall / And not a soul to hear",Pod.
1719,Would you like something for the pain?,What happened?
1720,What happened?,The murderer and traitor Stannis Baratheon suffered a stunning defeat at the hands of your father.
1721,Where am I?,"These are your new chambers. A little cramped, perhaps, but you don't need much room, do you? You are no longer Hand of the King."
1722,"These are your new chambers. A little cramped, perhaps, but you don't need much room, do you? You are no longer Hand of the King.","Oh, For your trouble."
1723,"Is this what you want, Lady Margaery?","With all my heart, Your Grace. I have come to love you from afar. Tales of your courage and wisdom have never been far from my ears. And those tales have taken root deep inside of me."
1724,"He'll let you go home? Joffrey's not the sort of boy who gives away his toys. You have a tender heart, just like your mother did at your age. I can see so much of her in you. She was like a sister to me. For her sake, I'll help get you home.",King's Landing is my home now.
1725,You sure? Most men like what they see.,I'm not like most men.
1726,Have we met?,You wouldn't remember me if we had?
1727,You wouldn't remember me if we had?,I meet a lot of men.
1728,You're afraid. Why? Nothing dangerous down there.,I know who you are.
1729,How do you know about that?,I thought you said you knew who I was.
1730,"What can I do for you, Lord Varys?",Littlefinger looks at you and sees a collection of profitable holes. I see a potential partner.
1731,"You're a virgin, I take it?",Walk.
1732,"Childhood must have been awful for you. Were you a foot taller than all the boys? They laughed at you, called you names? Some boys like a challenge. One or two must have tried to get inside Big Brienne.",One or two tried.
1733,What are you doing?,Burying them.
1734,"So unless it got stuck in your arse on its way to your cunt, it stands to reason that it's gone. Whoa. What's your business here?",Traveling a prisoner.

1737,Apparently eating is now a crime. Who knew?,"No, stealing is a crime."
1738,Where are you taking him?,To Riverrun.
1739,Why Riverrun?,"Steal from the Tullys, it's their dungeons you rot in."
1740,Why not kill him?,For stealing a pig?
1741,For stealing a pig?,I don't give the orders. He must be important to someone.
1742,Sending him with you? How important could he be?,"All right, have it your way, my lady."
1743,Do I know you?,Have you been to Ashemark?
1744,Have you been to Ashemark?,No.
1745,Do you ever go to the river market at Salt Rock?,Is it near Ashemark?
1746,Is it near Ashemark?,I've never been there.
1747,What do you think of these beauties?,I hope you gave them quick deaths.
1748,How do you know what the Kingslayer looks like?,I was at Whispering Wood. I saw him. They dragged him out of the woods and threw him down before the king.
1749,"I have a question for you both. And I want you to answer it at the same time. I count to three, you both answer. What's his name? One. Two. Three.",Two quick deaths.
1750,And you mean to do it anyway?,I love her.
1751,"And that is what would be in store for me with one of Walder Frey's daughters, what you and father had?",Why not? Because she's not beautiful? Because she's not exotic and exciting?
1752,Why not? Because she's not beautiful? Because she's not exotic and exciting?,Now you're arguing just to argue because you arranged it.
1753,"The flames lied. And I'm no better than a savage trusting in a fire god. I fought for your god in Blackwater Bay. I led my men to the gates of the seventh hell as their brothers burned alive, and for what? Attacked from behind by Tywin Lannister and the Tyrells. If you see so much in your flames, why didn't you warn me?",The Lord of Light only allows me glimpses.
1754,Will you quit the war just because you've lost a battle?,You talk about war as if you understand it.
1755,Have you? Show me how you fight.,Show me.
1756,Where's your god now? Will he save you? Where is your god?,Inside you.
1757,"Keep looking. Do you see? Do you see, my king?",Yes.
1758,No word from my father?,No.
1759,"Yes, my captors were so very kind to me. You love reminding me of that. Everyone in this frozen pile of shit has always loved reminding me of that. You know what it's like to be told how lucky you are to be someone's prisoner? To be told how much you owe them? And then to go back home to your real father","I will kill that man. I swear to the Drowned God, the Old Gods, the New Gods, to every fucking god in every fucking heaven, I will kill that man."
1760,"And what's your counsel, trusted friend?",Run. Five hundred Northmen wait outside the walls. You have twenty men. You can't win. Wait for nightfall and run.
1761,"I've done a lot, haven't I? Things I never imagined myself doing.","I've known you many years, Theon Greyjoy. You're not the man you're pretending to be. Not yet."
1762,"You hear that? That's the mating call of the Northmen. They want to fuck us. Well, I haven't had a good fuck in weeks. I'm ready for one.",They say every Ironborn man is worth a dozen from the mainland.
1763,You think they're right?,Aye.
1764,What is this? What are you doing?,Let's go home.
1765,Why should I believe you?,Why would I lie about it?
1766,Why would I lie about it?,To create strife between my sister and me.
1767,"Yes, my lord?",Would it be excessive of me to ask you to save my life twice in a week?
1768,Would it be excessive of me to ask you to save my life twice in a week?,"No, my lord."
1769,Don't want to swim too close to a drowning man? And I thought we were friends.,"We are. Podrick, would you mind?"
1770,"We are. Podrick, would you mind?","There are many who know that without you this city faced certain defeat. The king won't give you any honors, the histories won't mention you, but we will not forget."
1771,Good of me? Of course I come.,I want to see you.
1772,Have you looked?,I will be the first.
1773,Well?,You are a mess.
1774,You think I'm here for money?,That was the arrangement we made. I pay you and you lie to me.
1775,Leave?,"Leave King's Landing. They tried to kill you. They will try again. Going into wars, fighting soldiers, you're terrible at this. Let's take a boat to Pentos and never come back. You don't belong here."
1776,What would we do in Pentos?,"Eat, drink, fuck, live."
1777,"I can't. I do belong here. These bad people are what I'm good at. Out-talking them, out-thinking them. It's what I am. And I like it. I like it more than anything I've ever done. Are you going to leave?",You have a shit memory. I am yours and you are mine.
1778,Where are the guards?,"No guards. The warlocks kill with sorcery, not steel."
1779,Is this a riddle?,Khaleesi! Khaleesi!
1780,Are you trying to frighten me with magic tricks? You want me? Here I am. Are you afraid of a little girl?,How did he find us?
1781,How did he find us?,What are you doing here?
1782,What are you doing here?,Waiting for you.
1783,How did you know we'd come this way?,"After all the things you have seen, this is your question?"
1784,"After all the things you have seen, this is your question?",How did you kill those guards? Was it hard?
1785,How did you kill those guards? Was it hard?,"No harder than taking a new name, if you know the way."
1786,Where?,Far and away across the Narrow Sea to Braavos.
1787,What is it?,A coin of great value.
1788,Could it buy a horse?,It is not meant for the buying of horses.
1789,Then what good is it?,"If the day comes when you must find me again, just give that coin to any man from Braavos and say these words to him, ""Valar Morghulis."""
1790,"Osha, what are you doing?",Tell us what medicine to get from your chambers.
1791,Do you want to be with them?,You will be.
1792,"Never swung a sword before, have you? You look like a baby with a rattle.",Enough of that!
1793,"Why, traitor? So you can give Mance Rayder an invitation to Castle Black?",Let 'em fight.
1794,That's it? That's what you can do? You little shit.,Your traitor father teach you that?
1795,Your traitor father teach you that?,Or was it your whore mother?
1796,Or was it your whore mother?,We are the watchers on the Wall.
1797,Looks real enough to me. Real enough to buy a ship?,"Aye, a small ship."
1798,Is this goat?,It's moose. People shouldn't live anywhere you need to burn shit to keep warm.
1799,Three blasts?,Run!
1800,Brother?,Did you send the ravens?
1801,Did you send the ravens?,"Tarly, look at me. Did you send the ravens?"
1802,"Tarly, look at me. Did you send the ravens?","That was your job. Your only job. We need to get back to the Wall. It's a long march. We know what's out there, but we have to make it, have to warn them or before winter's done, everyone you've ever known will be dead."
1803,"First time you've seen a giant, Jon Snow?","Well, don't stare too long. They're shy. When they stop being shy, they get angry. And when they're angry, I've seen them pound a man straight into the ground like a hammer on a nail."
1804,"When I'm free, will I be free to go?","Sure, you will."
1805,What happened to their fathers?,"Some of them were killed by crows like you. Don't look so grim, Jon Snow. If Mance Rayder likes you, you'll live another day. And if he don't..."
1806,What do we want with a baby crow?,This baby killed Qhorin Halfhand. He wants to be one of us.
1807,"Plenty of little men tried to put their swords through my heart. And there's plenty of little skeletons buried in the woods. What's your name, boy?",Jon Snow.
1808,"Your Grace? Did you hear that? From now on, you'd better kneel every time I fart.","Stand, boy. We don't kneel for anyone beyond the Wall."
1809,"The girl likes you. You like her back, Snow? That why you want to join us?","Don't panic, boy. This isn't the damned Night's Watch where we make you swear off girls."
1810,He was my brother once. Back when he had a whole hand. What were you doing with him?,The Lord Commander sent me to the Halfhand for seasoning.
1811,Why?,He wants me to lead one day.
1812,"Why do you want to join us, Jon Snow?",I want to be free.
1813,"No, I don't think so. I think what you want most of all is to be a hero. I'll ask you one last time ... why do you want to join us?",We stopped at Craster's Keep on the way north. I saw...
1814,You saw what?,I saw Craster take his own baby boy and leave it in the woods. I saw what took it.
1815,You're telling me you saw one of them? And why would that make you desert your brothers?,"Because when I told the Lord Commander, he already knew. Thousands of years ago, the First Men battled the White Walkers and defeated them. I want to fight for the side that fights for the living. Did I come to the right place?"
1816,"Because when I told the Lord Commander, he already knew. Thousands of years ago, the First Men battled the White Walkers and defeated them. I want to fight for the side that fights for the living. Did I come to the right place?",We'll need to find you a new cloak.
1817,What if you took off that bit there?,Don't you want to leave something to the imagination?
1818,Don't you want to leave something to the imagination?,"Trouble is, I've never had much imagination."
1819,Pod?,It's your sister. The queen.
1820,What are they doing here?,"Protecting me, I assume. Will you let me in?"
1821,"Protecting me, I assume. Will you let me in?","No, I don't think so."
1822,"If I wanted to kill you, do you think I'd let a wooden door stop me?",They stay outside.
1823,Why are you here?,"I wanted to see your face. They said you'd lost your nose, but it's not as gruesome as all that."
1824,No? Curious. Bit of a comedown from chamber of the Hand. But then I don't suppose you need much room.,Grand Maester Pycelle made the same joke. You must be proud to be as funny as a man whose balls brush his knees.
1825,You're meeting Father today?,How do you know that?
1826,How do you know that?,Because I have hundreds of spies in my employ. The Master of Whisperers owes me a favor or two. Father told me. What do you want from him?
1827,Because I have hundreds of spies in my employ. The Master of Whisperers owes me a favor or two. Father told me. What do you want from him?,"What do I want from him? He's my father. Do I need to want something? I'm sure he loves me dearly, as any father loves his child, his baby boy. Yet he hasn't come to visit once since arriving in King's Landing. I lay here, my face split in half, but Father never came."
1828,"What do I want from him? He's my father. Do I need to want something? I'm sure he loves me dearly, as any father loves his child, his baby boy. Yet he hasn't come to visit once since arriving in King's Landing. I lay here, my face split in half, but Father never came.",You're going to make me cry.
1829,Why do you care what I want from him?,Because you've slandered me to Father before.
1830,Slandered? When?,You told him I had my guards beat that servant girl at Casterly Rock.
1831,And what's this truth you plan on telling him today?,Why are you so nervous about what I'm going to say to Father?
1832,Why are you so nervous about what I'm going to say to Father?,"Because you're a liar. I expect you'll tell lies about me, about Joffrey."
1833,Any lies in particular?,"You're a clever man, but you're not half as clever as you think you are."
1834,Do you grow bored protecting me?,I grow poor protecting you.
1835,"Poor? Poor? Under my patronage you've become a knight, you've served as Commander of the City Watch.",Briefly.
1836,How much?,Double.
1837,Double?,I'm a knight now. Knights are worth double.
1838,Who are you?,I was in the battle at Blackwater. I was a captain and a knight.
1839,"Aye, ser, and serving which king?",The one true king of Westeros... Stannis Baratheon.
1840,I thought you were dead. Everyone thought you were dead. And your son?,He may have swam ashore as you did.
1841,"If I was a good father, he'd still be here. Stannis lives?",He licks his wounds at Dragonstone.
1842,Will you take me there?,There is nothing for me at Dragonstone.
1843,What?,They built a great fire when Stannis returned. All those who spoke against her she called servants of darkness. They say she sang to them as they burned.
1844,Will it? They rot in the ground while their killer runs free.,The Kingslayer won't remain free for long. My best hunters are after him.
1845,A Mallister?,Ser Jeremy. My father's bannerman.
1846,"What's your name, friend?",Qyburn.
1847,Lucky?,The badge looks good on you. Almost as good as it looked on me. Are you enjoying your new position?
1848,The badge looks good on you. Almost as good as it looked on me. Are you enjoying your new position?,Am I enjoying it?
1849,Am I enjoying it?,I was very happy as Hand of the King.
1850,"What do you want, Tyrion?",Why does everyone assume I want something? Can't I simply visit with my beloved father? My beloved father who somehow forgot to visit his wounded son after he fell on the battlefield.
1851,Why does everyone assume I want something? Can't I simply visit with my beloved father? My beloved father who somehow forgot to visit his wounded son after he fell on the battlefield.,Maester Pycelle assured me your wounds were not fatal.
1852,"I organized the defense of this city while you held court in the ruins of Harrenhal. I led the foray when the enemies were at the gate while your grandson, the king, quivered in fear behind the walls. I bled in the mud for our family. And as my reward, I was trundled off to some dark little cell. But what do I want? A little bloody gratitude would be a start.","Jugglers and singers require applause. You are a Lannister. Do you think I demanded a garland of roses every time I suffered a wound on a battlefield? Hmm? Now, I have seven kingdoms to look after and three of them are in open rebellion. So tell me what you want."
1853,"Jugglers and singers require applause. You are a Lannister. Do you think I demanded a garland of roses every time I suffered a wound on a battlefield? Hmm? Now, I have seven kingdoms to look after and three of them are in open rebellion. So tell me what you want.","I want what is mine by right. Jaime is your eldest son, heir to your lands and titles. But he is a Kingsguard, forbidden from marriage or inheritance. The day Jaime put on the white cloak, he gave up his claim to Casterly Rock. I am your son and lawful heir."
1854,You want Casterly Rock?,It is mine by right.
1855,Why?,"Why? You ask that? You, who killed your mother to come into the world? You are an ill-made, spiteful little creature full of envy, lust, and low cunning. Men's laws give you the right to bear my name and display my colors since I cannot prove that you are not mine. And to teach me humility, the gods have condemned me to watch you waddle about wearing that proud lion that was my father's sigil and his father's before him. But neither gods nor men will ever compel me to let you turn Casterly Rock into your whorehouse. Go, now. Speak no more of your rights to Casterly Rock. Go."
1856,"Why? You ask that? You, who killed your mother to come into the world? You are an ill-made, spiteful little creature full of envy, lust, and low cunning.

But neither gods nor men will ever compel me to let you turn Casterly Rock into your whorehouse. Go, now. Speak no more of your rights to Casterly Rock. Go.","Oh, one more thing. The next whore I catch in your bed, I'll hang."
1857,Why Dorne?,It's carrying silk and it's supposed to bring back wine in exchange. But it's not coming back. The captain's tired of risking his life so King's Landing lords and ladies can get drunk on better wine than they deserve. He's going to stay in Dorne. Wait out the winter where it's beautiful and warm.
1858,What about that one there?,That one? It's going to Volantis.
1859,That one? It's going to Volantis.,Why?
1860,Why?,"Because when I got on a ship in Volantis, it looked like that one."
1861,Why should I make up a story when I know the truth?,Because the truth is always either terrible or boring.
1862,Might I speak with Lady Sansa alone for a moment?,I saw your mother not long ago. She's very eager to see you. And your sister.
1863,Arya's alive? You said you'd take me home.,You said King's Landing was your home. You are the property of the crown. Stealing you would be treason. If you were to tell just one person ...
1864,How do I know?,"Because I'm a terrible liar. You said so yourself. Please, Lord Baelish. Tell me what to do. Tell me when."
1865,You're her handmaiden?,Yes. And you're his...?
1866,Yes. And you're his...?,I help manage his affairs.
1867,And where is that?,It's not easy for girls like us to dig our way out. Watch out for her.
1868,Do those people have any better ideas about how to put you on the Iron Throne?,It's too beautiful a day to argue.
1869,By burning prisoners alive?,"How would you punish the infidels, Ser Davos?"
1870,"How would you punish the infidels, Ser Davos?","I do not judge people for the gods they worship. If I did, I'd have thrown you in the sea before you ever set foot on Dragonstone."
1871,"Was it me you fought on Blackwater Bay? Did I set your ships ablaze? I wasn't there when the wildfire killed our men by the thousands. I could have saved those men. You would have taken the city, Stannis would now sit upon his rightful throne, and you would stand beside him. But I wasn't there because you convinced your king to leave me behind. Do you hear them screaming? All those burning men in the water crying for their mothers, for their gods for help? Until the moment the Blackwater swallowed them.","Don't despair, Ser Davos. What I told your son is true."
1872,Why have we stopped?,"It's Lady Margaery, Your Grace."
1873,What is she doing? Who gave her permission?,"My lady. We should have guards, my lady."
1874,Why?,Pardon me.
1875,"Would you like to speak with her, Your Grace?",No.
1876,And your mother?,She died when she had me.
1877,And what do knights swear to do? Protect the weak and uphold the good. Your father did that. Be proud of him.,"Was your father a soldier, too?"
1878,"Was your father a soldier, too?","You should be proud, too. Under King Joffrey's leadership, your fathers saved the city. They saved us all. From now on, we're going to take care of you. All of you."
1879,"Please, sit. Sit. I do apologize, my lady. Small council meetings. At what point does it become treason to waste the king's time?","That's a lovely gown, my lady."
1880,"Shall I have them bring you a shawl, my lady?","I am touched by your concern, Your Grace. Luckily for us Tyrells, our blood runs quite warm. Doesn't it, Loras?"
1881,"I am touched by your concern, Your Grace. Luckily for us Tyrells, our blood runs quite warm. Doesn't it, Loras?",Yes.
1882,"Loras, isn't the queen's gown magnificent? The fabric, the embroidery, the metalwork. I've never seen anything like it.",You might find a bit of armor quite useful once you become queen. Perhaps before. Joffrey tells me you stopped your carriage at Flea Bottom on your way back from the sept this morning.
1883,"Truly, master?","No, not truly. Are you a girl or a goat to ask such a thing?"
1884,"No, not truly. Are you a girl or a goat to ask such a thing?",My master says the Unsullied are not men. Death means nothing to them.
1885,She's worried about their nipples? Doers the dumb bitch know we've cut off their balls?,My master points out that men don't need nipples.
1886,"You take a babe from its mother's arms, kill it as she watches, and pay for her pain with a silver coin?",She is offended. She asks if you pay a sliver coin to the mother for her dead baby.
1887,How many do you have to sell?,Eight thousand.
1888,"Once I own an army of slaves, what will I be?",Do you think these slaves will have better lives serving Kraznys and men like him or serving you?
1889,Do you think these slaves will have better lives serving Kraznys and men like him or serving you?,You'll be fair to them. You won't mutilate them to make a point.
1890,You know this man?,I know him as one of the greatest fighters the Seven Kingdoms has ever seen and as the Lord Commander of Robert Baratheon's Kingsguard.
1891,And which one of you was a marksman at ten?,Father?
1892,Father?,"You can't kill it, you know."
1893,Why not?,Because the raven is you.
1894,"Were you inside the wolf again, little lord?","No, it was the three-eyed raven."
1895,And who told you that? The three-eyed raven tell you?,No.
1896,Did you ever think you'd marry one?,I never thought I'd marry anyone at all.
1897,Never?,"Not until I met the king of the grim, bearded, stinking barbarians."
1898,Will I be wearing manacles when I lay my father to rest?,Something else?
1899,Something else?,"By the time Bolton's bastard Ramsay got to Winterfell, the Ironborn were gone. They massacred everyone and put the castle to the torch. And Bran and Rickon have not been found. They may have escaped. Or Theon may have taken them back to the Iron Islands as hostages."
1900,Have you received any demands?,No.
1901,Have you heard anything from Theon at all?,Where am I? Who are you? What do you want?
1902,Where am I? Who are you? What do you want?,I want to do this.
1903,Do you know how long it's going to take us to get to King's Landing walking through fields and forests?,Yes.
1904,So how shall we pass the time?,By putting one foot in front of the other.
1905,"You know, it doesn't matter how loyal a servant you are, no one enjoys the company of a humorless mute. Trust me on this. People have been serving me since I was born. You think Lady Stark is going to want a giant towheaded plank following her around for the rest of her life? A week's journey with you and she'll order you to fall on your sword.","If Lady Stark is unhappy with any aspect of my service, I'm sure she'll let me know. She's an honest woman."
1906,How did you come into Lady Stark's service? There's something we can talk about.,"Not your concern, Kingslayer."
1907,How would you know?,Because I visited Winterfell. I would have noticed your dour head smacking into the archways.
1908,Were you pledged to Stannis?,"Gods, no."
1909,"Ah, Renly. Really? He wasn't fit to rule over anything more important than a 12-course meal.",Shut your mouth.
1910,"Why? I lived with him at court since he was a boy, don't forget. Could hardly escape the little tulip. Skipping down the corridors in his embroidered silks. I knew him far better than you.","I knew him as well as anyone. As a member of his Kingsguard, he trusted me with everything. He would have been a wonderful king."
1911,"Did you ever tell him? No, of course not. You weren't Renly's type, I'm afraid.",He preferred curly-haired little girls like Loras Tyrell. You're far too much man for him.
1912,"Where are you headed, then?",South. You?
1913,South. You?,"Riverrun. Staying off the kingsroad, are you? They get you no matter where you go. You can't win."
1914,"Riverrun. Staying off the kingsroad, are you? They get you no matter where you go. You can't win.","No, you really can't."
1915,Maybe you're right. But what if you're not? What if he tells someone?,We're not doing it. He's an innocent man.
1916,More innocent than Lady Stark's daughters?,Make it tighter here.
1917,Who?,Margaery.
1918,"It is a good match, but what do you think of her? She's beautiful and intelligent.","Yes, she is."
1919,They never see it that way. He didn't ask you to do something for him? Spy on someone or...?,No.
1920,Why? What will you do? I will make him stop.,"Ser Loras Tyrell, my lady."
1921,"My sister Margaery invites you to take the air with her and our grandmother, the Lady Olenna, in the gardens. May I escort you to them?","I believe you grow more beautiful every day, Lady Sansa."
1922,Grandmother! What will Sansa think of us?,"She might think we have some wits about us. One of us, at any rate. It was treason. I warned them. Robert has two sons and Renly has an older brother. How could he possibly have any claim to that ugly iron chair? We should have stayed well out of all this if you ask me. But once the cow's been milked, there's no squirting the cream back up her udders. So here we are to see things through. What do you say to that, Sansa? Shall we have some lemon cakes?"
1923,"She might think we have some wits about us. One of us, at any rate. It was treason. I warned them. Robert has two sons and Renly has an older brother.

But once the cow's been milked, there's no squirting the cream back up her udders. So here we are to see things through. What do you say to that, Sansa? Shall we have some lemon cakes?",Lemon cake's my favorite.
1924,"So we've been told. Are you going to bring the food or do you mean to starve us to death? Here, Sansa, come sit with me. I'm much less boring than these others.",Do you know my son? The Lord of Highgarden?
1925,Do you know my son? The Lord of Highgarden?,I haven't had the pleasure.
1926,"You, you. Who else would know better? We've heard some troubling tales. Is there any truth to them? Has this boy mistreated you?",Has he ripped out your tongue?
1927,Has he ripped out your tongue?,"Joff-King Joffrey, he-His Grace is very fair and handsome and as brave as a lion"
1928,"Yes, all Lannisters are lions. And when a Tyrell farts, it smells like a rose. But how kind is he? How clever? Has he a good heart, a gentle hand?",I'm to be his wife. I only want to know what that means.
1929,"Are you frightened, child? No need for that. We're only women here. Tell us the truth. No harm will come to you.",My father always told the truth.
1930,Are we riding to battle at Riverrun?,Then it's a distraction.
1931,Have you lost faith in our cause?,"If it's revenge, I still got faith in it."
1932,You don't think we can win?,"May I speak my mind, Your Grace?"
1933,"May I speak my mind, Your Grace?","Have you not been speaking your mind, Lord Karstark?"
1934,"Have you not been speaking your mind, Lord Karstark?",I think you lost this war the day you married her.
1935,"I'm not afraid of her. May I help you, Lady Stark?",No.
1936,You've made them before?,Twice.
1937,Did they work?,After a fashion. I prayed for my son Bran to survive his fall.
1938,Which boy?,"Jon Snow. When my husband brought that baby home from the war, I couldn't bear to look at him. I didn't want to see those brown stranger's eyes staring up at me. So I prayed to the gods, take him away. Make him die. He got the pox. And I knew I was the worst woman who ever lived. A murderer. I'd condemned this poor, innocent child to a horrible death all because I was jealous of his mother. A woman he didn't even know. So I prayed to all seven gods, let the boy live. Let him live and I'll love him. I'll be a mother to him. I'll beg my husband to give him a true name, to call him Stark and be done with it, to make him one of us."
1939,Was it hard for you to kill the Halfhand?,Yes.
1940,"You liked him? I like you, but if you're playing us false, it won't be hard for me to kill you. I've got wildling blood in my veins. These are my people.",I understand.
1941,"Well, how could you understand?",You want to protect your people.
1942,"Do you know what it takes to unite 90 clans, half of whom want to massacre the other half for one insult or another? They speak seven different languages in my army. The Thenns hate the Hornfoots. The Hornfoots hate the ice-river clans. Everyone hates the cave people. So you know how I got moon worshippers and cannibals and giants to march together in the same army?",No.
1943,What's wrong with him?,"He's a warg. He can enter the mind of animals, see through their eyes. He's scouting for us."
1944,"What, you've never met a warg?",Orell.
1945,Where were you this time?,The Fist of the First Men.
1946,What did you see?,Dead crows.
1947,"What's the matter, Piggy? You crying 'cause you're cold? There's 200 brothers killed by dead men and you're still here whimpering. That seem fair to you? I seen 'em torn to pieces fighting while you was off somewhere hiding in a hole. Why don't you lie down and rest for a while, eh? You know you want to.","Hey. Get up, Sam."
1948,Why? So the rest of us can die? We'll move faster without him.,"What is this? Get up, Tarly. Is he all right?"
1949,"What is this? Get up, Tarly. Is he all right?","Aye, I think so."
1950,"That's enough. Tarly, I forbid you to die. Do you hear me?",Why should the rest of us-
1951,What am I supposed to do?,"Make sure he gets back alive. If he doesn't, you don't. Move on!"
1952,"I'm not dying for you, Piggy. You hear me?",Where's Rickon and Hodor?
1953,Where's Rickon and Hodor?,Looking for food.
1954,What's out there?,"Not another step, boy. Unless you want to drown in your own blood."
1955,Would you please shut up about it?,Jaqen H'ghar offered you three kills.
1956,"Jaqen got us out of Harrenhal, so why are you complaining?",But you could have ended the war.
1957,Where are we going?,North.
1958,"It's a hundred feet wide. How could we have passed it? If we hit the Red Fork, we can follow it west to Riverrun. My mother grew up there. My grandfather, he's a lord. He'll protect us.",Could be a minstrel.
1959,What's lurking behind that wall? A lion? A wolf?,"Just a dirty little cub, I think."
1960,You're a dangerous person. I like dangerous people. Why are your friends so shy?,What friends?
1961,What friends?,The fat to your left and the lad beside him.
1962,Three young ones on the run carrying castle-forged swords. You escape from Harrenhal?,Who are you?
1963,Who are you?,Thoros of Myr. And the fellow here with the bow is Anguy.
1964,"No, who do you fight for?",The Brotherhood without Banners. Now come along. I want to hear how two boys and a very dangerous girl escaped Harrenhal.
1965,I'm not going with them. The Brotherhood? That's who the Mountain and them lot were looking for. They'll bring us back and put rats in us.,"You've got nothing to fear from us, son. The lords of Westeros want to burn the countryside. We're trying to save it. Now come on. We'll talk some more over brown bread and stew. And then you can go on your way."
1966,Did anyone see you? No.,No.
1967,You sure? My father does not make idle threats. Having you killed would be the high point of his week. You have to be absolutely certain.,All right. What is this problem?
1968,All right. What is this problem?,"I'm worried about Sansa. When she spoke with Lord Baelish, his friend warned me about him."
1969,"Oh, Ros? The redhead?",How do you know her?
1970,How do you know her?,I try to know as many people as I can. You never know which one you'll need.
1971,And was she good? Did you like her?,"Not as much as I like you, obviously, or she'd be the one torturing me right now. What did she say about Littlefinger?"
1972,"Not as much as I like you, obviously, or she'd be the one torturing me right now. What did she say about Littlefinger?",That Sansa shouldn't trust him.
1973,Is there an idiot in any village who trusts Littlefinger?,We have to protect her.
1974,"A great beauty? Oh, a great beauty?","Yes, she is, objectively, very. Her face is quite pleasing-to other men and to women, people in general. But not to me, of course. I only have eyes for you."
1975,You pervert. You want her? This child?,I don't even want to talk about her.
1976,Now do you think I'm cruel?,Only if you stop. But you mustn't come here again.
1977,Do you hear me? You've come to a dangerous place full of dangerous people. Dangerous people.,"Lady Tyrell, my king."
1978,"You wanted to see me, Your Grace?",I'm leaving on a hunting trip. I just wanted to make sure you had everything you need before I left.
1979,Good. Good. How are you finding life in the capital? It must be quite a change after Renly's camp.,A welcome one. A military encampment is no place for a lady.
1980,And the bedside of a traitor? Is that a place for a lady?,"Your Grace, I tried to do my duty as a wife, that is all."
1981,What was your duty to this traitor as you saw it?,The duty of any wife to any husband-to provide him with children.
1982,"Why? I-I would not speak ill of the dead, Your Grace.",You think one ought to speak kindly of a traitor merely because he's had a sword put through his heart?
1983,You think one ought to speak kindly of a traitor merely because he's had a sword put through his heart?,No. I do beg your pardon. The subtleties of politics are often lost on me. Renly I don't believe he was interested in the company of women.
1984,What makes you say this?,"Whenever I wanted to make a child with him, he-he had so many excuses, so many late-night war councils. He never wanted to try. Except one evening, after he'd had far too much wine to drink, he suggested something-something that sounded very painful and couldn't possibly result in children. Maybe the fault was with me."
1985,Do you like it? I just had it made. Probably one of the finest weapons in the Seven Kingdoms.,It's beautiful. Will you show me how it works?
1986,It's beautiful. Will you show me how it works?,It's a new design. Much easier to load. There's no crank. You use this lever to draw the string.
1987,"Would you take me hunting sometime? Forgive me, Your Grace. I know a hunt is no place for a woman.",It's not unheard of.
1988,You no longer belong to him. Do you want to hold it?,May I? Please.
1989,May I? Please.,I imagine it must be so exciting to squeeze your finger here and watch something die over there.
1990,Could you do it? Could you kill something?.,"I don't know, Your Grace Do you think I could?"
1991,"I don't know, Your Grace Do you think I could?",Yes.
1992,Would you like to watch me?,Stop! Stop!
1993,About what?,I don't know what you want.
1994,What truth?,Why'd you take Winterfell?
1995,Why'd you take Winterfell?,I took it to-I took it-
1996,Who gave the orders?,No one. I took it on my own.
1997,Why?,To take the North while it was vulnerable.
1998,What were you going to do once you took it?,Hold it. Rule it.
1999,Why did you do that?,I told you. Why did you take Winterfell?
2000,I told you. Why did you take Winterfell?,I took it to bring glory to my house and my father.
2001,What are you doing?,Please.
2002,Yara?,I'll come for you tonight when the castle sleeps.
2003,A three-eyed raven?,You've seen it?
2004,You've seen it?,We saw him together. You haven't forgotten?
2005,We saw him together. You haven't forgotten?,Does it have anything to do with warging?
2006,Does it have anything to do with warging?,"No, the raven is something different, something deeper. The raven brings the sight."
2007,Seeing things that haven't happened yet?,Or things that happened long before you were born or things that are happening right now thousands of miles away.
2008,What's he telling him?,Why don't you ask?
2009,Why don't you ask?,"Isn't he ashamed, your brother, needing you to protect him?"
2010,"Isn't he ashamed, your brother, needing you to protect him?",Where's the shame in that?
2011,Where's the shame in that?,Any boy his age who needs his sister to protect him is gonna find himself needing lots of protecting.
2012,"You have the sight, too?","When I told my father about your father for the first time in my life, I saw him cry."
2013,Your father is Howland Reed? Yeah.,Yeah.
2014,"Your father told you about the rebellion? Mine never did. But I saw that, too.",What else have you seen?
2015,What else have you seen?,Only one thing that matters-you.
2016,"You see? They've all suffered through my bouts of sobriety. It's very tedious for all concerned. Now, how did three children-",We're not children.
2017,"How did three young persons such as yourselves, untrained in the art of war, escape from Harrenhal?",Gendry's a smith. He was apprenticed in the armory.
2018,"A smith, eh? Where'd you train?",King's Landing. Tobho Mott's shop.
2019,You'll free us?,I gave you my word.
2020,Now that is an uncommonly large person. How does one manage to subdue such an uncommonly large person?,One waits for him to drink until he passes out.
2021,Thoros? The fuck you doing here?,Drinking and talking too much. Same as ever.
2022,What in seven hells are you doing with the Stark bitch?,It's a tough decision - take the bridge and risk being seen or cross the great water.
2023,It's wonderful to watch you wrestle with these dilemmas. Which will she choose?,Gambler at heart. Wouldn't have guessed.
2024,"I have these, you know, on your feet when you walk too far. What do you call them?",Get up now.
2025,"See? If you were willing to hurt me, you might have had me there.","Looks like your woman's getting the better of you, if you can call that a woman."
2026,You sure he's the one?,"That's him, all right. I saw him fight at the tourney for Ser Willem Frey's wedding."
2027,"Enough to buy me a new head? If the King in the North hears I had the Kingslayer and let him go, he'll be taking it right off. I'd rather he takes yours.","If I may, nephew, I encountered a situation with one of my lieutenants at the Stone Mill which may have some bearing-"
2028,"Why don't you shut your mouth about that damned mill? And don't call him ""nephew."" He is your king.",Robb knows I meant him no disr-
2029,What value was the mill?,The Mountain was garrisoned across the river from it.
2030,Is he there now? Of course not.,We took the fight to him. He could not withstand us.
2031,Tywin Lannister has my sisters. Have I sued for peace?,No.
2032,Do you think he'll sue for peace because we have his father's brother's great-grandsons?,How many men did you lose?
2033,How many men did you lose?,"But for every man we lost, the Lannisters-"
2034,You know who isn't? Tywin Lannister.,Intimate. Lovely table. Better chairs than the old small council chamber. Conveniently close to your own quarters. I like it.
2035,What news of Jaime?,"Twenty thousand unwashed Northerns have known about his escape for weeks. Collectively, you control more spies and informants than the rest of the world combined. Do you mean to tell me that none of you has any notion of where he is?"
2036,"Twenty thousand unwashed Northerns have known about his escape for weeks. Collectively, you control more spies and informants than the rest of the world combined. Do you mean to tell me that none of you has any notion of where he is?","We are trying, my lord."
2037,"Try harder. What do we have, then?","Robb Stark and most of his bannermen are in Riverrun for the funeral of his grandfather Lord Hoster Tully. In Stark's absence, Roose Bolton holds Harrenhal, which would seem to make him Lord of Harrenhal, in practice if not in name."
2038,Master of Coin?,It would appear to be a position that best suits your talents.
2039,Would I?,They'll knock your teeth out.
2040,You think I care about my teeth?,"No, I don't think you care about your teeth. If you fight them, they will kill you. Do you understand? I'm the prisoner of value, not you. Let them have what they want. What does it matter?"
2041,"No, I don't think you care about your teeth. If you fight them, they will kill you. Do you understand? I'm the prisoner of value, not you. Let them have what they want. What does it matter?",What does it matter?
2042,What does it matter?,Close your eyes. Pretend they're Renly.
2043,"If you were a woman, you wouldn't resist? You'd let them do what they wanted?","If I was a woman, I'd make them kill me. But I'm not, thank the gods."
2044,Why are you helping him? He takes us prisoner and now he's our friend?,"You're not our prisoner, little lady."
2045,What am I?,Our guest. No one's put any chains on you.
2046,"So I can walk away, then?",These woods aren't safe for Ned Stark's daughter. You're lucky we found you.
2047,"You think you're good with that bow, you little twat?",Better than anyone you've ever met.
2048,Why? So you can kiss him?,You remember the last time you were here?
2049,You remember the last time you were here?,Looks like every other shit inn on the road.
2050,What are you doing? We're about to leave.,I'm staying.
2051,You're what?,"I baked some brown bread for the innkeep and she said she never had better. Told Thoros she's keeping me as a payment for all the free meals she's given him. Anyway, it's not me the Brotherhood wants. My brother ain't no king. I'm not a Stark of ""Winterhell""."
2052,You sure?,I'm sure.
2053,What is it?,It's a wolf.
2054,That's the tail?,Yeah.
2055,Maybe? Your father was a stubborn old ox. I was surprised when he died. Didn't think death had the patience.,I'm glad you were with him. I wish to the gods I had been. Did you make peace in the end?
2056,I'm glad you were with him. I wish to the gods I had been. Did you make peace in the end?,"After thirty years of fighting, I don't think he remembered what started it. He asked me to stop calling myself Blackfish. He said it was an old joke and it was never funny to begin with. I told him people had been calling me Blackfish for so long, they don't remember my real name."
2057,Is it true what they say about him?,I don't know. What do they say about him?
2058,I don't know. What do they say about him?,That he can turn into a wolf at night.
2059,"True. You're a Lannister, aren't you?",Martyn Lannister.
2060,"Martyn Lannister. You've nothing to fear. My husband doesn't eat children. Unless it's a full moon. It's not a full moon tonight, is it? See? Nothing to fear.",Always the artists.
2061,How many men were here?,About three hundred.
2062,And you know what those men are now?,We're all the same to them - meat for their army.
2063,Do you think anyone got away?,"It's not impossible. You don't go far betting against Mormont. But dead or alive, he took a big gamble coming north. And he lost. His best fighting men are dead. And whether he's Lord Commander of the Night's Watch or a blue-eyed corpse, he's a long way from home. Tormund. Climb the Wall. Take Orell and twenty good men. And take this one. He knows Castle Black's defenses better than any of us. And if he's useful, good. If not throw him off the Wall. See if crows can fly."
2064,"We're finally going to war, old friend?","Hide near Castle Black. When I give the signal, hit them in the night. They've got a big old wall to hide behind, but it only guards one side."
2065,How will we see your signal?,"Send your eagle above the Wall every night. When it's time, I'm going to light the biggest fire the North has ever seen."
2066,Ghost?,What have we here? Frozen crows?
2067,What have we here? Frozen crows?,We've come a long way.
2068,"Oh, can we?",They need some water.
2069,You are a godly man?,"I am. I got no fear of what's out there. When the white cold comes, your swords and cloaks and bloody fires won't help you. The only ones left will be those who are right with the gods. The real gods."
2070,"Go tell her she can bite down on a rag or she can bite down on my fist. Women. That sow right there gave birth to a litter of eight. Barely a grunt. And she's almost as fat as this one here. Now why don't you dine on him? Carve off what you need as you go. Well, look at him. He's a walking feast.",Here we are.
2071,"Sharpen these for me, would ya?",I see the head. Push.
2072,What is it? What is it?,Keep quiet.
2073,You're sure?,Ride east. Follow the rising sun. Your sister's waiting for you.
2074,You refuse to tell me where you're going?,I don't know yet. The fires will show me.
2075,How long will you be gone?,I don't know.
2076,Why?,You don't have the strength. It would kill you.
2077,To whom?,To any slave who contemplates doing whatever these slaves did.
2078,And what is she to do for soldiers?,We can find sellswords in Pentos and Myr.
2079,"Is it 'we' already, Ser Barristan? If you want to sit on the throne your ancestors built, you must win it. That will mean blood on your hands before the thing is done.","The blood of my enemies, not the blood of innocents."
2080,"How many wars have you fought in, Ser Barristan?",Three.
2081,Have you ever seen a war where innocents didn't die by the thousands?,"I was in King's Landing after the sack, khaleesi. You know what I saw? Butchery. Babies, children, old men. More women raped than you can count. There's a beast in every man and it stirs when you put a sword in his hand. But the Unsullied are not men. They do not rape. They do not put cities to the sword unless they're ordered to do so. If you buy them, the only men they'll kill are those you want dead."
2082,"I was in King's Landing after the sack, khaleesi. You know what I saw? Butchery. Babies, children, old men. More women raped than you can count. There's a beast in every man and it stirs when you put a sword in his hand. But the Unsullied are not men. They do not rape. They do not put cities to the sword unless they're ordered to do so. If you buy them, the only men they'll kill are those you want dead.","Do you disagree, Ser Barristan?"
2083,"Do you disagree, Ser Barristan?","When your brother Rhaegar led his army into battle at the Trident, men died for him because they believed in him, because they loved him, not because they'd been bought at a slaver's auction. I fought beside the last dragon on that day, Your Grace. I bled beside him."
2084,"Did you know him well, Ser Barristan?","I did, Your Grace. Finest man I ever met."
2085,"All? Did this one's ears mishear, Your Grace?",They did not. I want to buy them all.
2086,There are eight thousand Unsullied in Astapor. Is this what you mean by all?,Yes. eight thousand. And the ones still in training as well.
2087,"So, ask this beggar queen how will she pay for the remaining 7,877?","Master Kraznys asks how you propose to pay for the remaining 7,877 unsullied."
2088,"You're both here to advise me. I value your advice, but if you ever question me in front of strangers again, you'll be advising someone else. Is that understood?",Do you have a name?
2089,Do you have a name?,"This one's name is Missandei, Your Grace."
2090,Do you have a family? A mother and a father you'd return to if you had the choice?,"No, Your Grace. No family living."
2091,I offered water to one of the slaves dying on the Walk of Punishment. Do you know what he said to me? 'Let me die.',"There are no masters in the grave, Your Grace."
2092,Is it true what Master Kraznys told me about the Unsullied? About their obedience?,"All questions have been taken from them. They obey, that is all. Once they are yours, they are yours. They will fall on their swords if you command it."
2093,And what about you? You know that I'm taking you to war. You may go hungry. You may fall sick. You may be killed.,Valar morghulis.
2094,I know. But how would the queen get that idea?,Why don't you ask her? Any advice for me on my new position?
2095,Why don't you ask her? Any advice for me on my new position?,Keep a low profile.
2096,"They're only numbers. Numbers on paper. Once you understand that, it's easy to make them behave. Trivial even. You want a real challenge? Try whores.","I've tried quite a few. Well, lots of work to do. Enjoy the Eyrie."
2097,"Yes, my lord?","After a long consultation with my colleague Ser Bronn, I finally found a suitable reward for the services you've provided over and above what might be considered reasonable. Tell me, Pod, have you ever been with a woman?"
2098,"After a long consultation with my colleague Ser Bronn, I finally found a suitable reward for the services you've provided over and above what might be considered reasonable. Tell me, Pod, have you ever been with a woman?","No, my lord."
2099,"A fair enough repayment for putting your spear through my would-be killer's face, wouldn't you say?","Now, as it happens, Marei is quite the spear handler herself. She's here to thank you for staying by my side as the battle raged all around me."
2100,He's stealing it?,"Worse, he's borrowing it."
2101,What's wrong with that?,"We can't afford to pay it back, that's what's wrong with it. The crown owes millions to my father."
2102,"Forgive a debt, my father? For a man of the world, you're strangely naive.",I've never borrowed money before. I'm not clear on the rules.
2103,And what if I don't?,"Well, you have to."
2104,But what if I don't?,"This is why I don't lend you money. Anyway, it's not my father I'm worried about. It's the Iron Bank of Braavos. We owe them tens of millions. If we fail to repay these loans, the bank will fund our enemies. One way or another, they always get their gold back."
2105,"Ah, the return of the conquering hero. Does he have a little jaunt in his step?",The lado s practically skipping.
2106,You were gone a long time. I trust you got your money's worth. Or should I say my money's worth?,"Oh, it was a gift, Podrick. This is more than I give you in a year."
2107,Have you ever known a whore to turn down gold? They were happy enough to take it when I gave it to them.,What did you tell them?
2108,What did you tell them?,I didn't tell them anything.
2109,What did you do to them?,Lots of things.
2110,And they seemed to like these things?,Of course they seemed to like it. They're paid to seem to like it.
2111,"What are you saying? These ladies enjoyed him so much, they gave him the time for free?",Is that what you're telling us?
2112,Is that what you're telling us?,doesn't deny it.>/i>
2113,"You know how we deal with runaways here, do you?",Take off his pants.
2114,"You know who she is, don't you?",A big dumb bitch from who cares where. Never been with a woman that big.
2115,She's Brienne of Tarth. Her father is Lord Selwyn Tarth. Heard of Tarth?,I'm gonna cut your throat!
2116,They call it the Sapphire Isle. Do you know why? Every sapphire in Westeros was mined on Tarth. Sapphires are gemstones. The blue ones.,I know what they are.
2117,"Your father, he'd pay your weight in gold to get you back?","You'll be a rich man till the end of your days. And your sons will be rich men and their sons after them. Lands, titles- you'll have them all. The North can't win this war. You're a smart man. You understand that. We have the numbers. We have the gold."
2118,"Bring the bird over here and the carving knife. Will this work as a table, my lord?","Oh, yes. Yes, this will do nic- ah!"
2119,Have you got something to say?,"Careful. You don't want to say the wrong thing. You're nothing without your daddy, and your daddy ain't here. Never forget that."
2120,How many of those fingers do you think we could shove up his ass?,"Depends if he's had any practice. Is that the sort of thing you and your sister go in for, Kingslayer? She loosened you up for us?"
2121,"Depends if he's had any practice. Is that the sort of thing you and your sister go in for, Kingslayer? She loosened you up for us?",He's going to fall. He's going to fall off his horse. Someone help him.
2122,About the events of the Blackwater. Perhaps this is the wrong time?,"Oh, no. It's a wonderful time."
2123,End your life?,"I didn't inherit Littlefinger's spies along with his position, I'm afraid. Which is why I'm coming to you. I need proof."
2124,Proof? Will there be a trial?,I need to know.
2125,"I have no proof, only whispers. Before all this nastiness, I was going to tell you the story of how I was cut. Do you want to hear it still?",I don't know. Do I?
2126,I don't know. Do I?,"As a boy, I traveled with a troupe of actors through the Free Cities. One day in Myr, a certain man made my master an offer too tempting to refuse. I feared the man meant to use me as I'd heard some men used small boys. But what he wanted was far worse. He gave me a potion that made me powerless to move or speak, yet did nothing to dull my senses. With a hooked blade he sliced me, root and stem, chanting all the while. He burned my parts in a brazier. The flames turned blue and I heard a voice answer his call. I still dream of that night. Not of the sorcerer, not of his blade. I dream of the voice from the flames. Was it a god? A demon? A conjurer's trick? I don't know. But the sorcerer called and a voice answered. And ever since that day, I have hated magic and all those who practice it. But you can see why I was eager to aid in your fight against Stannis and his Red Priestess. A symbolic revenge of sorts."

I feel the need for actual revenge against the actual person who tried to have me killed. Which will require a degree of influence, which-"
2128,The Lord Commander told us to go to the Fist of the First Men. How'd that turn out for us?,He had no way of knowing.
2129,So he's your new protector now? Our good friend Craster?,We're like the sons he never had.
2130,He's beautiful. Does he have a name?,No.
2131,Are you going to give him one?,Why?
2132,Why?,Here.
2133,I don't want your stupid thimble. I want to save my baby's life. Can you do that? Can you?,I don't have time for you. I don't have time for anyone but him because he doesn't have much time.
2134,How?,You know how.
2135,How many times have I told you? No climbing.,"Mother, I need to find it. It's here. It's calling me."
2136,Is he very large?,"No larger than usual, apparently. And yet they said that he was-"
2137,We're talking about the same Podrick? The quiet boy in Lord Tyrion's service? Seems a bit simple?,What did he do to them?
2138,What did he do to them?,"I don't know, my lord. The girls are usually quite descriptive."
2139,So what did they say?,They said it was hard to describe.
2140,Huh. Prodigies appear in the oddest of places. And what did Littlefinger say about this loss of income?,He was too preoccupied to notice. He's leaving for the Eyrie soon. I'm helping him prepare for his journey.
2141,"Ah, yes, to pursue his enduring love of the Lady Arryn and the title that comes with her. Sad, really. Is that all it takes to make our friend lose interest in poor Sansa Stark?","He hasn't spoken to her since the last time, as far as I know. But I don't think he's lost interest."
2142,What makes you say so?,His shipboard inventory.
2143,Of course. I'm missing something obvious you're about to point out?,Two featherbeds. He's bringing two featherbeds for the cabin.
2144,Who is important enough to Littlefinger to merit a featherbed besides Littlefinger? Could he be bringing one of his girls?,"He's not interested in them, my lord."
2145,How do you know?,Because I'm one of his girls.
2146,What is this place?,Somewhere neither wolves nor lions come prowling.
2147,You're still swineherds and tanners and masons. You think carrying a crooked spear makes you a soldier?,No. Fighting in a war makes you a soldier.
2148,Beric Dondarrion? You've seen better days.,And I won't see them again.
2149,"Last I heard, you were King Joffrey's guard dog. But here you are a thousand miles from home. Which of us is running?",Untie these ropes and we'll find out. What are you doing leading a mob of peasants?
2150,Untie these ropes and we'll find out. What are you doing leading a mob of peasants?,Ned Stark ordered me to execute your brother in King Robert's name.
2151,You found god? Is that it?,Aye. I've been reborn in the light of the one true god. As have we all. As would any man who's seen the things we've seen.
2152,Do you take me for my brother? Is being born Clegane a crime?,Murder is a crime.
2153,You don't deny killing this boy?,I was Joffrey's sworn shield. The boy attacked the prince.
2154,"So, who will it be? Should we find out if your fire god really loves you, priest? Or you, archer? What are you worth with a sword in your hand? Or is the little girl the bravest one here?",Aye. She might be. But it's me you'll fight.
2155,"And who knows? In ten years, some of the boys you send them may be Unsullied in their turn. Thus all shall prosper.","Is it done, then? They belong to me?"
2156,"Is it done, then? They belong to me?",It is done.
2157,You speak Valyrian?,"I am Daenerys Stormborn of the House Targaryen, of the blood of Old Valyria. Valyrian is my mother tongue."
2158,"Unsullied! You have been slaves all your life. Today you are free. Any man who wishes to leave may leave, and no one will harm him. I give you my word. Will you fight for me? As free men?","Lord, cast your light upon us."
2159,How often do these patrols go out?,"It varies. If I knew where on the Wall we were heading, I could tell you."
2160,There are nineteen castles guarding the Wall. How many are manned?,Three.
2161,You sure of that?,Which three?
2162,Which three?,Castle Black.
2163,"Aye, Castle Black. Everyone knows Castle Black. Which others?",Eastwatch-by-the-Sea and the Shadow Tower.
2164,How many men remain in Castle Black?,A thousand.
2165,What happens to your eagle after I kill you? Does he drift away like a kite with his strings cut or does he just flop dead to the ground?,He's no crow.
2166,Of course you do. Who stopped Rattleshirt when he was about to cut your throat? Who vouched for you with Mance? It seems you owe me a debt.,Give it back.
2167,Is Orell right? Are you still a crow? It's time you proved yourself.,Ygritte.
2168,"Why are you still dressed? You know nothing, Jon Sno-",That thing you did with your mouth- is that what lords do to their ladies in the South?
2169,That thing you did with your mouth- is that what lords do to their ladies in the South?,I don't know. I just wanted to kiss you there is all.
2170,"Aye, I liked it some. Who taught you that?",There's been no one else. Only you.
2171,I was a man of the Night's Watch. How about you? Were you a maid?,What do you think?
2172,What do you think?,Who was he?
2173,Who was he?,"Just a boy. He came trading with his brothers. He had red hair like me. Kissed by fire. But he was weak. Not like you. That was the first one. Then there was this Thenn boy. Spoke no Common, but gods, he was built like a mammoth."
2174,How long's it been since you had a bath?,"Let's not go back. Let's stay here a while longer. I don't ever want to leave this cave, Jon Snow. Not ever."
2175,Send it to his father?,You'll hold your tongue unless you want to lose it.
2176,Is there word from the capital?,You haven't heard? Stannis Baratheon laid siege to King's Landing. Sailed into Blackwater Bay. Stormed the gates with thousands of men. And your sister How can I put this? Your sister is alive and well. Your father's forces prevailed.
2177,You haven't heard? Stannis Baratheon laid siege to King's Landing. Sailed into Blackwater Bay. Stormed the gates with thousands of men. And your sister How can I put this? Your sister is alive and well. Your father's forces prevailed.,Ser Jaime isn't well. Take him to Qyburn.
2178,Will I die?,No. The corruption has spread. I fear it must be cut away. The safest course would be to take the whole arm off.
2179,Then you'll die. You're no maester. Where's your chain?,"The Citadel stripped me of it. They found some of my experiments too bold. I can leave your upper arm, make the cut at your elbow."
2180,I see. And have you shared these suspicions with Lord Tywin?,My father's a practical man. He appreciates facts.
2181,Thank you. And your best will prove better than when I asked you to locate Arya Stark?,I assure you that it will.
2182,No need to speak. Are there any figs? Fetch some. I always take figs midafternoon. They help move the bowels. To what do I owe this summons?,"Thank you for seeing me, my lady. I had hoped we might discuss a few financial matters."
2183,I climbed all those steps to discuss financial matters?,It's the royal wedding. I'm told you had a hand in planning it.
2184,What good is the word extravagant if it can't be used to describe a royal wedding?,I understand that.
2185,And?,"And we're at war, Lady Olenna."
2186,"I can't think how it slipped my mind. What is it, twelve thousand infantrymen the Tyrell family has supplied? Two thousand in support. Provisions so this city might survive the winter. A million bushels of wheat. Half a million bushels each of barley, oats, and rye. Twenty thousand head of cattle. Fifty thousand sheep. You don't have to lecture me about wartime expenses. I'm quite familiar with them.",And we are so grateful for your contributions which are necessary for the preservation of the realm.
2187,"As is a royal wedding. The people are hungry for more than just food. They crave distractions. And if we don't provide them, they'll create their own. And their distractions are likely to end with us being torn to pieces. A royal wedding is much safer. Wouldn't you say?",I would.
2188,"I was told you were drunk, impertinent, and thoroughly debauched. You can imagine my disappointment at finding nothing but a browbeaten bookkeeper. Where did you go for them, Volantis?",My lady-
2189,"Oh, very well. I won't have it said that House Tyrell refuses to play its part. We'll pay for half the expenses and the celebrations will go on as planned. Is that sufficient?",Quite sufficient. Thank you.
2190,What are you doing?,Just mending Lord Beric's armor.
2191,Why?,I'm going to stay on and smith for the Brotherhood.
2192,"Have you lost your mind? When the Lannisters find this place, you think they'll spare the smiths? They'll cave your head in with your own helmet.",The Lannisters wanted to kill me long before I joined the Brotherhood.
2193,"What? Serve him? I've served men my entire life. I served Master Mott at King's Landing and he sold me to the Watch. I served Lord Tywin at Harrenhal, wondering every day if I'd get tortured or killed. I'm done serving.",You just said you were serving Lord Beric.
2194,Is this a rescue?,Lannister filth! Take him!
2195,Is that all of them? It took five of you to murder two unarmed squires?,"Not murder, Your Grace. Vengeance."
2196,Vengeance? Those boys didn't kill your sons. I saw Harrion die on the battlefield and Torrhen-,Was strangled by the Kingslayer. They were his kin.
2197,"It's treason to free your enemies. In war, you kill your enemies. Did your father not teach you that, boy?",Leave him.
2198,Aye. Leave me to the king. He wants to give me a scolding before he sets me free. That's how he deals with treason. Our King in the North. Or should I call him the King Who Lost the North?,Escort Lord Karstark to the dungeon. Hang the rest.
2199,Would you make me a liar as well as a murderer?,It wouldn't be lying. We will bury them and remain silent until the war is done.
2200,"Rickard Karstark, Lord of Karhold, here in sight of gods and men, I sentence you to die. Would you speak a final word?",Kill me and be cursed. You are no king of mine.
2201,Joffrey. Cersei. Ilyn Payne. Ser Meryn. The Hound. What are you going to do with me?,At first light we'll ride for Riverrun. Your brother's there now. He'll make a contribution to our cause and you can go home.
2202,So why don't you?,We need the gold.
2203,"Do I frighten you, child?",No.
2204,But how?,Thoros how many times have you brought me back?
2205,Thoros how many times have you brought me back?,It's the Lord of Light brings you back. I'm just the lucky drunk who says the words.
2206,How many times?,"Five, I think. No, this makes six."
2207,Then the Lannisters caught me and executed me for treason. Was it a hanging or a dagger in the eye?,Both. Fuckers couldn't decide.
2208,Could you bring back a man without a head? Not six times. Just once.,"I don't think it works that way, child."
2209,So you've come to see her as well? There is no need. You must keep away from such distractions.,She's my daughter. I want to see her.
2210,Mother said you fought in a battle. Did you win?,No.
2211,Did the Onion Knight come back with you?,He did. He fought bravely.
2212,Why not? He's my friend. Look.,He made this for me. But don't tell Mother I have it. It's a secret. Mother doesn't like the Onion Knight.
2213,What are you doing here?,I need a bath. Help me out of these rags.
2214,Why should I care how you die?,"You swore a solemn vow, remember? You're supposed to get me to King's Landing in one piece. Not going so well, is it? No wonder Renly died with you guarding him."
2215,"You swore a solemn vow, remember? You're supposed to get me to King's Landing in one piece. Not going so well, is it? No wonder Renly died with you guarding him.",That was unworthy. Forgive me. You protected me better than most-
2216,There it is. There's the look. I've seen it for seventeen years on face after face. You all despise me. Kingslayer. Oathbreaker. A man without honor. You've heard of wildfire?,Of course.
2217,"The Mad King was obsessed with it. He loved to watch people burn, the way their skin blackened and blistered and melted off their bones. He burned lords he didn't like. He burned Hands who disobeyed him. He burned anyone who was against him. Before long, half the country was against him. Aerys saw traitors everywhere. So he had his pyromancer place caches of wildfire all over the city- beneath the Sept of Baelor and the slums of Flea Bottom. Under houses, stables, taverns. Even beneath the Red Keep itself. Finally, the day of reckoning came. Robert Baratheon marched on the capital after his victory at the Trident. But my father arrived first with the whole Lannister army at his back, promising to defend the city against the rebels. I knew my father better than that. He's never been one to pick the losing side. I told the Mad King as much. I urged him to surrender peacefully. But the king didn't listen to me. He didn't listen to Varys who tried to warn him. But he did listen to Grand Maester Pycelle, that grey, sunken cunt. 'You can trust the Lannisters,' he said. 'The Lannisters have always been true friends of the crown.' So we opened the gates and my father sacked the city. Once again, I came to the king, begging him to surrender. He told me to bring him my father's head. Then he turned to his pyromancer. 'Burn them all,' he said. 'Burn them in their homes. Burn them in their beds.' Tell me, if your precious Renly commanded you to kill your own father and stand by while thousands of men, women, and children burned alive, would you have done it? Would you have kept your oath then?","First, I killed the pyromancer. And then when the king turned to flee, I drove my sword into his back. 'Burn them all,' he kept saying. 'Burn them all.' I don't think he expected to die. He- he meant to burn with the rest of us and rise again, reborn as a dragon to turn his enemies to ash. I slit his throat to make sure that didn't happen. That's where Ned Stark found me."
2218,If this is true why didn't you tell anyone? Why didn't you tell Lord Stark?,Stark? You think the honorable Ned Stark wanted to hear my side? He judged me guilty the moment he set eyes on me. By what right does the wolf judge the lion? By what right?
2219,Stark? You think the honorable Ned Stark wanted to hear my side? He judged me guilty the moment he set eyes on me. By what right does the wolf judge the lion? By what right?,Help! Help! The Kingslayer!
2220,"Princess? Gods, what are you doing here?","Shh, you'll wake Bert."
2221,Bert?,He's the fat one. He's on guard duty tonight. He likes to drink wine and sleep a lot.
2222,he said you Were a traitor. Are you?,"I am, child. I disobeyed my king, your father, and now I'm paying the price."
2223,I don't care. You're my friend. You must get bored down here. I brought you something to read. It's about Aegon and his dragons. Aegon used to live here. Did you know that? And the Targaryens built this castle.,Aye. So they did.
2224,You can't?,I'll teach you. I'll come when Bert's on duty and teach you.
2225,"Why not? What will they do, lock us in cells?",I wouldn't know where to start.
2226,"Mm, you were first through the breach at Pyke?","The second. Thoros of Myr went in alone, waving that flaming sword of his."
2227,Thoros of Myr. Bloody madman. Robert knighted you after the battle?,"Proudest moment of my life. One knee in the dust, the king's sword on my shoulder, listening to the words. 'In the name of the Warrior, I charge you to be brave.' All I could think of was how badly I had to piss."
2228,"Yes. And a man of honor keeps his vows, even if he's serving a drunk or a lunatic. Just once in my life before it's over, I want to know what it's like to serve with pride, to fight for someone I believe in. Do you believe in her?",With all my heart.
2229,These are the ones?,"Yes, khaleesi. The officers."
2230,You did not choose this life. But you are free men now. And free men make their own choices. Have you selected your own leader from amongst your ranks?,Remove your helmet
2231,What is your name?,Grey Worm.
2232,No? Doesn't the Lord of the Kingsguard traditionally-,"Traditionally, yes, but I killed a dozen of Robert's friends during his rebellion."
2233,Which men do you have in mind?,"Forgive me, Ser Jorah, for what I'm about to say, but your reputation in Westeros has suffered over the years."
2234,"Our cause? Forgive me, Ser Barristan, but I was busy defending the khaleesi against King Robert's assassins while you were still bowing to the man.",We both want her to rule. Am I wrong?
2235,We both want her to rule. Am I wrong?,You only joined us a few days ago. I can't speak to your intentions.
2236,What can I do? Attack King's Landing? There's nothing he'd like better. He'd crush us in a day.,We could ride north. Take your land back from the Greyjoys. Wait out the winter.
2237,What?,"Oh, I don't know. I don't even know where Winterfell is."
2238,What is it?,"I can't force them to meet us in the field and I can't attack them where they're strongest, but I can attack them where they're not."
2239,Can you do it?,I need men to replace the Karstarks who marched home. There is only one person in this kingdom with that kind of army who hasn't already sided with the Lannisters. The man whose daughter I was supposed to marry- Walder Frey.
2240,How did you know?,Know what?
2241,Know what?,That I wanted to.
2242,"You have a good deal of experience, do you?",With the husbands.
2243,Is he? And who's the lucky girl?,"She may not be the grandest ship in the world or the fastest, but she's mine. I've always wanted a ship. Now I want a dozen. Strange, isn't it?"
2244,"She may not be the grandest ship in the world or the fastest, but she's mine. I've always wanted a ship. Now I want a dozen. Strange, isn't it?",What is?
2245,What is?,"It doesn't matter what we want, once we get it, then we want something else. Your hair is different."
2246,Is it?,Lady Margaery wears it that way.
2247,You still want me to come with you?,"It's not a question of what I want. It's what you want. You want to go home, don't you?"
2248,"It's not a question of what I want. It's what you want. You want to go home, don't you?","Of course. More than anything. But maybe it would be better to wait. I've been thinking how dangerous it would be. Not just for me, but for you. You've been so kind. I'd feel terrible if anything happened to you. I can't tell you how touched I am by your concern for my welfare."
2249,What's she doing here?,"Our business concerns her, too. Sit."
2250,Sansa is the key to the North? I seem to remember she has an older brother.,The Karstarks have marched home. The young wolf has lost half his army. His days are numbered. Theon Greyjoy murdered both his brothers. That makes Sansa Stark the heir to Winterfell. And I am not about to hand her over to the Tyrells.
2251,The Tyrell army is helping us to win this war. Do you really think it's wise to refuse them?,There's nothing to refuse. This is a plot. Plots are not public knowledge. And the Tyrells won't carry this one out until after Joffrey's wedding. We need to act first and kill this union in its crib.
2252,And how do we do that?,We find Sansa Stark a different husband.
2253,Joffrey has made this poor girl's life miserable since the day he took her father's head. Now she's finally free of him and you give her to me? That's cruel even for you.,"Do you intend on mistreating her? The girl's happiness is not my concern, nor should it be yours."
2254,"Do you intend on mistreating her? The girl's happiness is not my concern, nor should it be yours.",She's a child!
2255,"There, you see? You will wed her, bed her, and put a child in her. Surely you're capable of that.",And if I refuse?
2256,And if I refuse?,You wanted to be rewarded for your valor in battle. Sansa Stark is a finer reward than you could ever dare hope for. And it is past time you were wed.
2257,I was wed. Or don't you remember?,Only too well.
2258,What do you mean?,You'll marry Ser Loras.
2259,Someone built your fires for you growing up?,"It doesn't get so cold down in the Reach. And there were servants, of course."
2260,What does it do?,"I'm not sure that it does anything. It's beautiful, though, isn't it?"
2261,"I'm not sure that it does anything. It's beautiful, though, isn't it?",How much longer?
2262,How much longer?,Not so far. A few more days.
2263,Is the Wall as big as they say?,Bigger. So big you can't even see the top sometimes. It's hidden in clouds.
2264,Do you sing?,"No. No, no, no. Not very well."
2265,"Oh, you're gonna punch the rabbits to death?",I had someone else in mind.
2266,"Well, some of us would say thank you when someone else hunts down their breakfast for them. Or don't they teach you to say thank you north of the Wall?","You've got a big mouth, girl, and too many teeth."
2267,"Me? It's my fault? First time I met her, she put a knife to my throat.","First time I met you, you held a knife at me. We can't fight each other. We'll never make it to the Wall. I want you both to make peace."
2268,"I said so, didn't I?",Osha!
2269,"Thank you. See? Not so hard, is it? Thank you.",Don't push me.
2270,What's happening?,I'm right here with you.
2271,What's wrong with him?,The visions take their toll.
2272,He's having one now?,I saw Jon Snow.
2273,You saw him? At Castle Black?,He was on the wrong side of the Wall surrounded by enemies.
2274,You ever climbed it before?,No. But Tormundo s done it half a hundred times. You're afraid.
2275,Aren't you?,"Aye. It's a long way up and a long way down. But I've waited my whole life to see the world from up there. Here, sit down."
2276,You kill someone for them?,"Nah. I didn't kill him, but I bet his balls are still bruised."
2277,Can we not talk about that here?,"Can we not talk about that here? I'm Jon Snow. I've killed dead men and Qhorin Halfhand, but I'm scared of naked girls."
2278,"Can we not talk about that here? I'm Jon Snow. I've killed dead men and Qhorin Halfhand, but I'm scared of naked girls.",Did I seem scared the other day?
2279,Did I seem scared the other day?,You were trembling like a leaf.
2280,What secret?,Do you think I'm as dumb as all those girls in silk dresses you knew growing up? You're loyal and you're brave. You didn't stop being a crow the day you walked into Mance Rayder's tent.
2281,Do you think I'm as dumb as all those girls in silk dresses you knew growing up? You're loyal and you're brave. You didn't stop being a crow the day you walked into Mance Rayder's tent.,"But I'm your woman now, Jon Snow. You're going to be loyal to your woman. The Night's Watch don't care if you live or die. Mance Rayder don't care if I live or die. We're just soldiers in their armies and there's plenty more to carry on if we go down."
2282,What?,Your muscles tense up when you hold. Pull the string back to the center of your chin and release. Never hold.
2283,Never aim?,Your eye knows where it wants the arrow to go. Trust your eye.
2284,The High Priest gave you a mission. Turn King Robert away from his idols and towards the Lord of Light. What happened?,I failed.
2285,"You worship Him in your way, and I'll worship Him in mine. Do you speak the common tongue?","My friends here don't speak High Valyrian. Why are you here, my lady?"
2286,"My friends here don't speak High Valyrian. Why are you here, my lady?",Forgive my manners. I don't see many ladies these days.
2287,How many times has the Lord brought him back?,Six.
2288,"The other side? There is no other side. I have been to the darkness, my lady. He sent you to us for a reason.",You have someone He needs.
2289,Bodkin point. Penetrates plate at two hundred yards. Can you make 'em?,"Yeah, nothing tricky about it. Just need decent steel."
2290,What does that have to do with anything?,"Forgive me, lad."
2291,What are you doing? Let go of him.,Tell them to stop. Come on. He wants to be one of you. He wants to join the Brotherhood. Stop them!
2292,Did the Lord of Light tell you that or did she?,You're not doing this for your god. You're doing it for gold.
2293,"You staring at my ass, Jon Snow?",Look out!
2294,You all right?,"Just seeing if you can take a hit, lad."
2295,Sorry. Were you sleeping?,Wa-
2296,Wa-? Wa-? Water? You want some water. I wish I had some for you.,So let's play a game. Which body part do you need the least?
2297,So let's play a game. Which body part do you need the least?,Please.
2298,"But you've already told me everything. Remember? Your daddy was mean to you. The Starks didn't appreciate you. One good bit, though. The Stark boys, they're still alive. Wouldn't that be a hunt to remember? You failed, but I'm a better hunter than you.","Now how about your little finger? You don't use that for much, do you? No? Good. Let's start with that."
2299,"Now how about your little finger? You don't use that for much, do you? No? Good. Let's start with that.","You've been wondering why you're here. Haven't you? Where you are. Who I am. Why I'm doing this to you. So guess. If you guess right, I'll tell you. By the old gods and the new, I swear it. You win the game if you can figure out who I am and why I'm torturing you and I win the game if you beg me to cut off your finger."
2300,"You've been wondering why you're here. Haven't you? Where you are. Who I am. Why I'm doing this to you. So guess. If you guess right, I'll tell you. By the old gods and the new, I swear it. You win the game if you can figure out who I am and why I'm torturing you and I win the game if you beg me to cut off your finger.","If I win, you'll let me go?"
2301,"If I win, you'll let me go?","If you think this has a happy ending, you haven't been paying attention."
2302,You say please again and you'll wish you hadn't. You first. Where are we?,The North.
2303,"Now, where?",Last Hearth.
2304,Do I look like a fucking Umber to you?,Karhold!
2305,Karhold? How did you know that? Did you see any banners flying when we came in?,No. It was just a guess.
2306,"Very good, Lord Theon. And who am I?",Torrhen Karstark.
2307,What?,No.
2308,How old is she?,Nineteen.
2309,Could I see her first?,You want to count her teeth? We depart for the Twins in the morning. We need an answer before we leave and a wedding not more than a fortnight thereafter or this alliance is at an end.
2310,You want to count her teeth? We depart for the Twins in the morning. We need an answer before we leave and a wedding not more than a fortnight thereafter or this alliance is at an end.,Your father does realize we're in the middle of a war?
2311,Your father does realize we're in the middle of a war?,Father is old. It will put his heart at peace if he could see her wed to a good husband.
2312,"Why should I let that old ferret choose my bride for me? At the very least, I should be offered the same choice you were. I'm his liege lord.",He's a proud man and we've wounded him.
2313,You're willing to risk our freedom and our lives for a chance at a prettier wife?,I have a war to fight. We can't win it without them. I have no time to haggle. You said you wanted to make amends for the Stone Mill.
2314,You recall that heroic engagement?,I had something less permanent in mind.
2315,"You should. But instead, you're sitting here watching me fail at dinner. Why might that be?",Wars cost money. Many people would pay a great deal for you.
2316,Shall we drink on it?,I don't partake.
2317,You do understand how suspicious that is to ordinary people?,"Very well. My lady, may our journey continue without further incident."
2318,Why?,My grandson is the pride of Highgarden. The most desirable bachelor in all seven kingdoms. Your daughter-
2319,Old?,"Old. I'm something of an expert on the subject. Her change will be upon her before long. I'll spare you the details of what will happen then. You men may have a stomach for bloodshed and slaughter, but this is another matter entirely."
2320,"The years punish us as well, I promise you that. My stomach remains quite strong, however. The only thing that might turn it are details of your grandson's nocturnal activities. Do you deny them?","Oh, not at all. A sword swallower through and through."
2321,"Did you grow up with boy cousins, Lord Tywin? Sons of your father's bannermen, squires, stable boys?",Of course.
2322,Not once? Not in any way?,Never.
2323,You would have your grandson protected by someone who disgusts you?,"I would have my grandson protected by a skilled warrior who takes his vows seriously. So, shall I draw up the order? Or do you consent to this marriage?"
2324,"I would have my grandson protected by a skilled warrior who takes his vows seriously. So, shall I draw up the order? Or do you consent to this marriage?",It's a rare enough thing- a man who lives up to his reputation.
2325,"Yes, me, too. Definitely. I've dreamed of a large wedding since I was quite young. The guests, the food, the tournaments. And the bride, of course. The most beautiful bride in the world in a beautiful gown of gold and green brocade with fringed sleeves. Have you ever been to Highgarden, my lady?",No. I had never left Winterfell before I came to King's Landing. But it sounds wonderful. I can't wait to see it. And to leave this place.
2326,"It's terrible, isn't it? The most terrible place there is.",I don't suppose there's anything we can do about this.
2327,Trying to have me killed is an odd way of saying thank you. There are two people in King's Landing who can give an order to a Kingsguard. Did you or did you not order Ser Mandon to kill me during the Battle of the Blackwater?,"The impulse I understand. He hates me because I'm the only one who tells him what he really is. So, fair enough. He wants me dead. But his stupidity? He could have had me poisoned and no one would have known. But the king orders a Kingsguard to murder the Hand of the King in full view of his own army. The boy's an idiot."
2328,"The impulse I understand. He hates me because I'm the only one who tells him what he really is. So, fair enough. He wants me dead. But his stupidity? He could have had me poisoned and no one would have known. But the king orders a Kingsguard to murder the Hand of the King in full view of his own army. The boy's an idiot.",What do you want me to say?
2329,What do you want me to say?,I want you to tell me if my life is still in danger.
2330,"When Jaime gets back, yes. But when do we think that's going to be? He's out there somewhere.","Jaime or not, I'm truly fucked."
2331,Who's going to tell her?,Do you think people will like it?
2332,Do you think people will like it?,I don't think they will even notice it.
2333,Will they let me invite my family?,They haven't asked my opinion.
2334,But do you think they will?,No.
2335,Why do you need to speak to her alone?,"Shae. Please excuse her, Lord Tyrion. She's not from here. But I trust her, even though she tells me not to."
2336,How to begin? It's- this- this- this is awkward.,"A thousand blades taken from the hands of Aegon's fallen enemies, forged in the fiery breath of Balerion the Dread."
2337,"Thwarting you has never been my primary ambition, I promise you. Although who doesn't like to see their friends fail now and then?","You're so right. For instance, when I thwarted your plan to give Sansa Stark to the Tyrells. If I'm going to be honest, I did feel an unmistakable sense of enjoyment there. But your confidant, the one who fed you information about my plans, the one you swore to protect, you didn't bring her any enjoyment. And she didn't bring me any enjoyment. She was a bad investment on my part. Luckily, I have a friend who wanted to try something new. Something daring. And he was so grateful to me for providing this fresh experience."
2338,The realm? Do you know what the realm is? It's the thousand blades of Aegon's enemies. A story we agree to tell each other over and over till we forget that it's a lie.,But what do we have left once we abandon the lie? Chaos. A gaping pit waiting to swallow us all.
2339,But what do we have left once we abandon the lie? Chaos. A gaping pit waiting to swallow us all.,Chaos isn't a pit. Chaos is a ladder.
2340,How far are we?,"About a week, I think."
2341,You think? You don't know?,"When we went to Castle Black, we took the Kingsroad."
2342,You and your roads. Is that how you lot do your fighting? You march down the road banging drums and waving banners?,"Most of the time, yes."
2343,How do the men holding the banners fight?,"They don't, really. It's a great honor to carry your house sigil."
2344,"And the drummers- is that a great honor, too?",Usually it's the young boys banging the drums.
2345,So what good are they?,They help the men march.
2346,How?,"Well, it's- it's the rhythm."
2347,"Oh, you mean right foot, left foot, right foot, left foot, right foot? You need help remembering that? When Mance gives the signal and we hit Castle Black, we won't be banging on drums to let them know we're coming.","No. No, you're just gonna light the biggest fire the North has ever seen to let them know you're coming."
2348,"Cut her loose, too. Do you see her sulking about it? That's because she understands the way things are.",And are you gonna share it with me? The deep wisdom you found inside the head of a bird?
2349,And are you gonna share it with me? The deep wisdom you found inside the head of a bird?,"People work together when it suits them. They're loyal when it suits them. They love each other when it suits them. And they kill each other when it suits them. She knows that, you don't. Which is why you'll never hold onto her."
2350,Prickly? That what you call it? Might be the least pleasant man I've ever met.,"Yes, and that is why-"
2351,Who are you writing?,My mother.
2352,Is that Valyrian?,Gaaa.
2353,Gaaa? Say hello for me.,Rytsas.
2354,Does she know her daughter's a queen?,Not yet.
2355,How am I supposed to sit here planning a war when you're over there looking like that?,Will you come with me one day to Volantis? When all this is over?
2356,Will you come with me one day to Volantis? When all this is over?,I will.
2357,"What, now? Are you certain?",Are you angry with me?
2358,Are you angry with me?,Angry? You're my queen.
2359,Angry? You're my queen.,And I have your little prince or princess inside me.
2360,Can you leave the war for one night?,I love you. Do you hear me? I love you.
2361,I love you. Do you hear me? I love you.,Most men fuck like dogs.
2362,"You think he loves you, is that it? What did he tell you? He's gonna make you his lady and live with you in some castle?","No, he didn't tell me anything. He barely talks."
2363,"What, you're jealous?",Of course I'm jealous. You should be with one of your own.
2364,And you're one of my own? I've never heard a kind word from your mouth.,You would if you were mine. I'd tell you that you're beautiful and fierce and wild. I'd be good to you. You love him?
2365,You would if you were mine. I'd tell you that you're beautiful and fierce and wild. I'd be good to you. You love him?,Cause he's pretty? Is that it? You like his pretty hair and his pretty eyes? You think pretty is gonna make you happy?
2366,Cause he's pretty? Is that it? You like his pretty hair and his pretty eyes? You think pretty is gonna make you happy?,Don't touch me.
2367,How do I make the best of my circumstances? I have to marry him.,Has Lord Tyrion mistreated you?
2368,Has Lord Tyrion mistreated you?,No.
2369,Has he been kind to you?,He's tried.
2370,"Far from the worst Lannister, wouldn't you say?",I'm sorry. Here I am complaining to you.
2371,"My son will be king Sons learn from their mothers. I plan to teach mine a great deal. And your son, if I'm not mistaken, your son might be the Lord of Casterly Rock and the North someday. What?",My son with him. I'll have to- we'll have to-
2372,"What is it, then? He's rather good-looking even with the scar. Especially with the scar.",He's a dwarf. And Loras- Loras.
2373,And that's a good thing?,"It can be. We're very complicated, you know. Pleasing us takes practice."
2374,How do you know all this? Did your mother teach you?,"Yes, sweet girl. My mother taught me."
2375,What's the youngest you've ever had?,Not that young.
2376,How much older?,Older.
2377,Shae is a whore. Are you gonna marry her? Eh? How did marrying a whore work out for you the first time?,I should never have told you about that.
2378,You wanted to speak to me?,Yes. I'd like a report on the meetings of my small council.
2379,May I ask why?,"The Tower of the Hand is where I work. To walk from there to here would take time, time I could otherwise spend productively."
2380,"So if I wanted to attend a council meeting, I would now have to climb all the stairs in the Tower of the Hand?",We could arrange to have you carried.
2381,Where did you hear about this?,Is it true?
2382,Is it true?,Apparently so.
2383,Don't you think we ought to do something about it?,"When I was Hand of the King under your father's predecessor, the skulls of all the Targaryen dragons were kept in this room. The skull of the last of them was right here. It was the size of an apple."
2384,But how do we know these dragons are just curiosities and not the beasts that brought the whole world to heel?,Because we have been told as much by the many experts who serve the realm by counseling the king on matters about which he knows nothing.
2385,How many slaves are there in Yunkai?,Two hundred thousand if not more.
2386,Will the noble lord take refreshment?,"Ancient and glorious is Yunkai. Our empire was old before dragons stirred in old Valyria. Many an army has broken against our walls. You shall find no easy conquest here, khaleesi."
2387,"If blood is your desire, blood shall flow. But why? 'Tis true you have committed savageries in Astapor. But the Yunkai are a forgiving and generous people.",The wise masters of Yunkai have sent a gift for the silver queen.
2388,My ship?,"Yes, khaleesi. As I said, we are a generous people. You shall have as many ships as you require."
2389,And what do you ask in return?,All we ask is that you make use of these ships. Sail them back to Westeros where you belong and leave us to conduct our affairs in peace.
2390,My life?,"And the lives of your wise masters. But I also want something in return. You will release every slave in Yunkai. Every man, woman, and child shall be given as much food, clothing, and property as they can carry as payment for their years of servitude. Reject this gift, and I shall show you no mercy."
2391,"My gold. You gave it to me, remember? And I shall put it to good use. You'd be wise to do the same with my gift to you. Now get out.",The Yunkish are a proud people. They will not bend.
2392,And what happens to things that don't bend? He said he had powerful friends. Who was he talking about?,I don't know.
2393,Chains?,Solid gold from the mines outside Lannisport. Smithed in Casterly Rock.
2394,Do I need a ship?,What?
2395,What?,Am I going somewhere?
2396,Am I going somewhere?,Of course you're not going anywhere.
2397,"So, am I invited to your wedding?",I didn't ask for this marriage. I didn't want it.
2398,No? She's a beautiful girl. You said so yourself.,"That doesn't mean that- this is duty, not desire."
2399,Is that what you will tell yourself when you fuck her?,I don't have a choice. My father-
2400,What would I do there? Juggle? I am a Lannister of Casterly Rock.,And I'm Shae the funny whore.
2401,While I empty her chamber pot and lick your cock when you're bored?,I swear to you it will not be like that.
2402,No? What will it be like?,"I will buy you a good home somewhere in the city. You will have fine clothes, guards to keep you safe, servants. Any children we might have will be well provided for."
2403,Children? You think I want children who can never see their father? Who would be killed in their sleep if their grandfather found out about them?,"Listen. Listen to me, my lady."
2404,What happened?,Wildfire. I should have been here.
2405,Do you miss it?,King's Landing?
2406,King's Landing?,Your father's house.
2407,Haven't you ever wondered where your strength came from? Your talent for fighting?,I'm lowborn. As low as can be. My mother was a tavern wench.
2408,"The bastard of Robert of the House Baratheon, First of His Name, King of the Andals and the First Men. Why do you think the gold cloaks wanted you? There is power in a king's blood.","Come sit by the fire, child."
2409,"Not talking, eh? That's a first.",I don't talk to traitors.
2410,No? Who's yours?,Death.
2411,How many?,No more than twenty.
2412,How far?,Less than a day's ride south.
2413,"What do you say, boys? Time for a lion hunt?",Yeah!
2414,But what about Riverrun? It's not south. It's west of here.,It will still be west of here two days from now.
2415,Why? So you can steal their gold?,"I swear to you, this isn't-"
2416,Have they told you what they plan to do with me?,Lord Bolton's traveling tomorrow as well. He's going to the Twins for Edmure Tully's wedding. You're to remain here.
2417,With Locke?,I owe you a debt.
2418,"You will give my regards to Lord Tywin, I trust?",Tell Robb Stark I'm sorry I couldn't make his uncle's wedding. The Lannisters send their regards.
2419,"Safe journey, Kingslayer. Nothing to say? I liked you better before. I don't remember chopping your balls off, too. And don't you worry about your friend. We'll take good care of her.",Shh.
2420,Where is he?,"Who, my lord?"
2421,"Who, my lord?","There's no one here but you, me, and Violet."
2422,Don't you want us to see it?,"Oh, come on. Let us see it. Everybody talks about it."
2423,Who sent us?,"We sent ourselves, Lord Greyjoy."
2424,Oh. Do you think we're ugly? He thinks we're ugly.,"Well, he's been through so much. Look at his poor face."
2425,And how can we make him feel better?,I have an idea.
2426,As good as they say?,Mmm.
2427,And why should you get all the fun?,What? You like her better?
2428,What? You like her better?,Plenty there for both of us.
2429,Well? Should we see this cock everyone's always going on about?,Everyone knows you love girls. I bet you always thought they loved you back.
2430,Your famous cock must be very precious to you. Would you say it's your most precious part?,"Please. No. No! Mercy, please! Please, mercy! Mercy!"
2431,Is that a palace?,It's a windmill.
2432,Windmill. Who built it? Some king?,Just the men who used to live here.
2433,What's swooning?,Fainting.
2434,What's fainting?,When a girl sees blood and collapses.
2435,Why would a girl see blood and collapse?,Well not all girls are like you.
2436,"Well, girls see more blood than boys. Or do you like girls who swoon, Jon Snow? Oh, a spider! Save me, Jon Snow.",My dress is made of the purest silk from Tralalalaleeday.
2437,Would you?,So I could tear it off you.
2438,And how do you know that?,"Every boy in the North knows it. We grow up learning it. Where the battles were fought, the names of the heroes, who died where. Six times you've invaded and six times you've failed. The seventh will be the same."
2439,What's he going on about? And how come he always gets to sit and chat while we do all the work?,Hodor.
2440,What are you telling him?,"It's all right, Osha."
2441,It's not all right. You think I can't hear you every day? Filling his head with black magic. Talking about visions and three-eyed ravens and worse.,Leave him alone.
2442,So what do you talk about?,What's happening to him and what that means.
2443,What did you say?,I told you already. Jon Snow isn't there. Bran needs to find the raven beyond the Wall.
2444,What if I belong in the North? What if I fell from that tower for a reason?,"Is that what he's telling you? That it's all for a reason? All these bad things happened because the gods got big plans for you? I wish it were true, little lord. But the gods wouldn't spare a raven's cold shit for you or me or anyone."
2445,"Is that what he's telling you? That it's all for a reason? All these bad things happened because the gods got big plans for you? I wish it were true, little lord. But the gods wouldn't spare a raven's cold shit for you or me or anyone.",You don't understand. You don't know.
2446,"How is the pain, my lord?",What's the purpose of an arm with no hand?
2447,What's the purpose of an arm with no hand?,"Well, we've stymied the corruption."
2448,So why did the Citadel take your chain? Did you fondle one boy too many?,"No, my lord. That's not my weakness."
2449,What is?,Curiosity. The only way to treat disease is to understand disease. And the only way to understand it is to study the afflicted.
2450,With their permission?,My studies have given me insight that has saved many lives.
2451,"How many men have you killed, my lord?",I don't know.
2452,Fifty? A hundred?,Countless.
2453,And how many lives have you saved?,Half a million. The population of King's Landing. You were in charge of the ravens at Harrenhal. Did you- did you get a bird off to Brienne's father in Tarth?
2454,Half a million. The population of King's Landing. You were in charge of the ravens at Harrenhal. Did you- did you get a bird off to Brienne's father in Tarth?,A bird flew off and a bird flew back. Lord Selwyn Tarth offered three hundred gold dragons for his daughter's safe return.
2455,Why not?,He's convinced Lord Tarth owns all the sapphire mines in Westeros.
2456,Why?,I've left something behind.
2457,And what are those orders?,To deliver you to your father at King's Landing.
2458,A wooden sword?,I thought you'd gone.
2459,What the fuck are you doing to my bear?,Lord Bolton charged me with bringing him back to King's Landing alive and that's what I aim to do.
2460,What do you think is more important to Lord Bolton? Getting his pet rat a reward or ensuring Tywin Lannister gets his son back alive?,"Well, we must be on our way. Sorry about the sapphires."
2461,Is that the Blackwater?,The Blackwater? Where do you think I'm taking you?
2462,The Blackwater? Where do you think I'm taking you?,Back to King's Landing to Joffrey and the queen.
2463,But why?,Because your mother and brother will be there and they'll pay me for you.
2464,Why would they be at the Twins?,Those outlaws you love so much never told you? The whole countryside is yapping about it. Your uncle is marrying one of the Frey girls. So quit trying to bash my skull in and we might just make it there in time for the wedding.
2465,Those outlaws you love so much never told you? The whole countryside is yapping about it. Your uncle is marrying one of the Frey girls. So quit trying to bash my skull in and we might just make it there in time for the wedding.,Men who fight for gold have neither honor nor loyalty. They cannot be trusted.
2466,You know these men?,"Only by the broken swords on their banners. They're called the Second Sons. A company led by a Braavosi named Mero, ""The Titan's Bastard."""
2467,Is he more titan or bastard?,"He's a dangerous man, khaleesi. They all are."
2468,How many?,"Two thousand, Your Grace. Armored and mounted."
2469,Enough to make a difference?,It's hard to collect wages from a corpse. I'm sure the sellswords prefer to fight for the winning side.
2470,You are the Mother of Dragons? I swear I fucked you once in a pleasure house in Lys.,Mind your tongue.
2471,Why? I didn't mind hers. She licked my ass like she was born to do it.,"You, slave girl, bring wine."
2472,"Give me your Second Sons and I may not have you gelded. Ser Barristan, how many men fight for the Second Sons?","Under two thousand, Your Grace."
2473,"We have more, don't we?",Ten thousand Unsullied.
2474,"My Queen, shall I slice out his tongue for you?",These men are our guests. You seem to be enjoying my wine. Perhaps you'd like a flagon to help you ponder.
2475,Only a flagon? And what are my brothers in arms to drink?,"A barrel, then."
2476,What do you mean to do with him?,You know what I mean to do with him.
2477,"Then why bathe him and dress him in fine clothes? If it needs to be done, do it. Don't torture the boy.","Have you ever slaughtered a lamb, my king?"
2478,"Have you ever slaughtered a lamb, my king?",No.
2479,You've slaughtered many lambs?,And none have seen the blade.
2480,They feeding you enough?,"Two meals a day. Cold for breakfast, hot for supper. I cannot complain."
2481,Why?,She says there's power in king's blood.
2482,"Forgive me, Your Grace, I'm not a learned man, but is there a difference between kill and sacrifice? The boy is your nephew.",What of it? We're at war. Why should I spare the son of some tavern slut Robert bedded one drunken night?
2483,What of it? We're at war. Why should I spare the son of some tavern slut Robert bedded one drunken night?,Because he has your blood in his veins.
2484,"How many boys live in Westeros? How many girls? How many men? How many women?The darkness will devour them all, she says. The night that never ends. Unless I triumph. I never asked for this. No more than I asked to be king. We do not choose our destiny, but we must do our duty, no? Great or small, we must do our duty. What's one bastard boy against a kingdom?","Your Grace, why did you come to see me today?"
2485,"Your Grace, why did you come to see me today?",I came to free you. If you swear never to raise your hand to the Lady Melisandre again.
2486,"I saw a vision in the flames. A great battle in the snow. I saw it. And you saw whatever she gave birth to. I never believed, but when you see the truth, when it's right there in front of you as real as these iron bars, how can you deny her god is real?",Little dragon bitch. She talks too much.
2487,My cock will find a way. Tell him. Is there any place that my cock can't reach?,She'll tell me whatever you pay her to tell me.
2488,She sells her sheath and you sell your blade. What's the difference?,I fight for beauty.
2489,For beauty?,We fight for gold.
2490,What do we do about the dragon girl? We can't beat eight thousand Unsullied on the battlefield.,There won't be a battle. And we don't have to deal with her eunuchs. We only have to deal with her.
2491,Which one of us?,"Close your eyes, love."
2492,Do you hear me? Follow my voice. I'm right here.,You have something for me?
2493,You have something for me?,Valar morghulis.
2494,"Oh, yes. The husband of your dreams. But you do look glorious. Perhaps we could have a moment alone. Do you mind? Podrick, could you escort Lady Stark's handmaiden?","My lady, I want you to know I didn't ask for this."
2495,"But I promise you one thing, my lady. I won't ever hurt you. Do you drink wine?",When I have to.
2496,Radiant? Why radiant?,It's the word that came to mind.
2497,"You're a musical girl, aren't you? I imagine you have a lovely voice.","A better dancer than a singer, I'm afraid."
2498,"Ah, but you know the song 'The Rains of Castamere'?",Of course. They play it so often here at court.
2499,So you know the story of House Reyne of Castamere?,"Not as well as you, I'm sure."
2500,House Reyne was a powerful family. Very wealthy. The second wealthiest in Westeros. Aren't the Tyrells the second wealthiest family in Westeros now?,"Of course, ambitious climbers don't want to stop on the second highest rung. If only you could take that final step, you'd see further than all the rest. You'd be alone with nothing but blue sky above you. So Lord Reyne built a castle as grand as Casterly Rock. He gave his wife diamonds larger than any my mother ever wore. And finally one day, he rebelled against my father. Do you know where House Reyne is now?"
2501,"Of course, ambitious climbers don't want to stop on the second highest rung. If only you could take that final step, you'd see further than all the rest. You'd be alone with nothing but blue sky above you. So Lord Reyne built a castle as grand as Casterly Rock. He gave his wife diamonds larger than any my mother ever wore. And finally one day, he rebelled against my father. Do you know where House Reyne is now?",Gone.
2502,"Gone. A gentle word. Why not say slaughtered? Every man, woman, and child put to the sword.","I remember seeing their bodies hanging high above the gates of Casterly Rock. My father let them rot up there all summer. It was a long summer. 'And now the rains weep o'er their halls, and not a soul to hear.'"
2503,What are you doing?,"Your father's gone. As the father of the realm, it is my duty to give you away to your husband."
2504,Have you ever seen one like it?,I've never seen anything like any of this. Not in my life.
2505,"It's shocking, isn't it, the first time you encounter real wealth? When I was your age, I lived on one bowl of stew a day. And stew is a kind word for it.",In Flea Bottom we called them bowls of brown. We'd pretend that the meat in them was chicken. We knew it wasn't chicken.
2506,You think I'm trying to poison you?,That's good.
2507,Where do you think it's from?,I couldn't even guess.
2508,"Doesn't matter, does it? It's the real thing or it's not. You only need a tongue to tell the difference. Go on, have some more. You still don't trust it. You think this is all a mistake and that you'll have to pay somehow for every bite you take.","That thought had crossed my mind, yeah."
2509,"According to whom? The Silent Sisters? With their stern looks, muzzled mouths, and dried-up cunts? What have their gods done for you? Hmm? When you pray to them, what's their answer? A god is real or he's not. You only need eyes to see.","Death is coming for everyone and everything. A darkness that will swallow the dawn. And we can stop it, you and I."
2510,What are you doing?,You have to trust me.
2511,What-? Get it away. Get it off me.,"Don't fight, don't fight. They won't take much."
2512,Why are you doing this?,I told you there's power in the blood of kings. And you have so much blood.
2513,"So their son will be your nephew. After you're wed to Cersei, of course. And you will be the king's stepfather and brother-in-law. When you marry the king, Joffrey's mother will become his sister-in-law and your son will be Loras' nephew? Grandson? I'm not sure. But your brother will become your father-in-law. That much is beyond dispute.","Will you pardon me, my lord?"
2514,"Will you pardon me, my lord?",Of course. Of course. En-enjoy.
2515,Rather less than I plan to be. Isn't it a man's duty to be drunk at his own wedding?,"This isn't about your wedding. Renly Baratheon had a wedding. Your wife needs a child, a Lannister child, as soon as possible."
2516,And?,"If you're going to give her one, you need to perform."
2517,What did you once call me? A drunken little lust-filled beast.,More than once.
2518,"Well, you've done it. You've married a Lannister. Soon you'll have a Lannister baby. It's a dream come true for you, isn't it? What a glorious day.","Yes, Your Grace."
2519,I suppose it doesn't really matter which Lannister puts the baby into you. Maybe I'll pay you a visit tonight after my uncle passes out. How'd you like that?,You wouldn't? That's all right. Ser Meryn and Ser Boros will hold you down.
2520,You wouldn't? That's all right. Ser Meryn and Ser Boros will hold you down.,Time for the bedding ceremony.
2521,"Where's your respect for tradition, Uncle? Come, everyone. Pick her up and carry her to her wedding bed. Get rid of her gown. She won't be needing it any longer. Ladies, attend to my uncle. He's not heavy.",There will be if I command it.
2522,What did you say? What did you say?,"I believe we can dispense with the bedding, Your Grace. I'm sure Tyrion did not mean to threaten the king."
2523,"I vomited on a girl once in the middle of the act. Not proud of it. But I think honesty is important between a man and wife, don't you agree? Come, I'll tell you all about it. Put you in the mood.","Is that wise, my lord?"
2524,"Is that wise, my lord?","Tyrion, Sansa. My name is Tyrion."
2525,"Is that wise, Tyrion?",Nothing was ever wiser.
2526,What?,Neck. You have one. How old are you exactly?
2527,Neck. You have one. How old are you exactly?,Fourteen.
2528,What if I never want you to?,And so my watch begins.
2529,How can anyone speak nineteen languages?,It only took Your Grace a year to learn Dothraki reasonably well.
2530,"Yes, well, it was either learn Dothraki or grunt at my husband and hope- what do you mean reasonably well?",Dothraki is difficult for the mouth to master. So guttural and harsh.
2531,What do you want?,You.
2532,You were sent here to kill me?,So why haven't you?
2533,So why haven't you?,I don't want to.
2534,What do your captains have to say about that?,You should ask them.
2535,Why?,We had philosophical differences.
2536,Over what?,Your beauty. It meant more to me than it did to them.
2537,And this is supposed to impress me?,Yes.
2538,Why would I trust a man who murders his comrades?,They ordered me to murder you. I told them I preferred not to. They told me I had no choice. I told them I am Daario Naharis. I always have a choice. They drew their swords and I drew mine.
2539,Will you fight for me?,Swear to me.
2540,How hard can it be to build a fire?,It doesn't matter. Come under the furs. We can keep each other warm.
2541,A what?,"Well, I mean, there's no real difference."
2542,You thought of a name yet? It would be easier to refer to him if he had a name.,Sometimes do you talk fancy on purpose to confuse me?
2543,Sometimes do you talk fancy on purpose to confuse me?,What? No. This is just the way I talk.
2544,What? No. This is just the way I talk.,I'll build that fire.
2545,Don't you think he should have a name?,I don't know many boys' names.
2546,Why is it a last name?,"Well, it's a family name. For instance, I'm Samwell Tarly. Samwell is my birth name and Tarly is my family name. You see? So my father is also a Tarly."
2547,"Well, it's a family name. For instance, I'm Samwell Tarly. Samwell is my birth name and Tarly is my family name. You see? So my father is also a Tarly.","His name is Samwell Tarly, too?"
2548,"His name is Samwell Tarly, too?","No, Randyll Tarly."
2549,Is your father cruel like mine?,Different manner of cruel.
2550,Are you sure about this?,No.
2551,Why are you telling me?,You begged me not to send Theon to negotiate with his father and I ignored your advice.
2552,"So, Casterly Rock? I'm asking your advice.",We have enough men?
2553,We have enough men?,If Walder Frey cooperates.
2554,My granddaughter Marianne. My granddaughter Freya. My granddaughter...W-W-Wertha? Waldra? Waldina?,I'm Merry.
2555,"Love. That's what the Starks of Winterfell call it, eh? Heh. Very honorable, I call it a pretty face. Mmmm, very pretty. Prettier than this lot, that's for sure. Very shapely as well. Oh, you try to hide her under that dress. If you wanted to hide her, you shouldn't have brought her here in the first place.","I can always see what's going on beneath a dress. Been at this a long time. I bet when you take that dress off, everything stays right where it is. Doesn't drop an inch."
2556,Where?,There.
2557,Your men but not you?,I have no interest in slaves. A man cannot make love to property.
2558,You command the Unsullied. What do you think?,"Lo jention mirre nūmāzme ēza, iderenna qopsa verdagon issa."
2559,How do you know all that?,I read about it in a very old book.
2560,You know all that from staring at marks on paper?,Yes.
2561,"The roads have gone right to hell, haven't they? Cracked three spokes this morning.",Need a hand?
2562,Need a hand?,Need about eight hands.
2563,"You're so dangerous, aren't you? Saying scary things to little girls. Killing little boys and old people. A real hard man you are.",More than anyone you know.
2564,That so?,You'd be like a kitten to him. He'd kill you with his little finger.
2565,That him?,No.
2566,Where are we?,"The Gift, I think. Brandon The Builder gave all this land south of the Wall to the Night's Watch for their sustenance and support. Maester Luwin taught me that."
2567,It's good land and there's no war up here. Why leave?,Wildlings.
2568,What's one old man doing with eight horses?,He breeds them for the Watch.
2569,How's he keep folks from stealing them?,The Watch protects him.
2570,That give you some ideas?,Might do.
2571,How are we going to get past the Wall? My uncle said it's 700 feet high.,How did you get past it?
2572,How did you get past it?,Got in a boat and rowed past the Bay of Seals.
2573,Just one?,There's more.
2574,Where's Shaggydog and Summer?,Hunting.
2575,What did you do?,Nothing. I don't know.
2576,What's That?,That's a horse dying.
2577,Where you riding?,"Doesn't matter now, does it?"
2578,"Doesn't matter now, does it?","No, it doesn't matter now."
2579,Do you hear me?,You're not gonna die for one of them.
2580,That's what you call a few guards?,"Lord Edmure, I hope I'm not a disappointment to you."
2581,Is that safe?,They're long gone.
2582,They can't do that north of the Wall?,No one can do that. Anywhere.
2583,Where?,He was with the wildlings. They tried to kill him but he got away.
2584,Me? I'm coming with you.,No. You and Osha and Shaggydog head for the Last Hearth. The Umbers are our bannermen. They'll protect you.
2585,Will you know how to find the last Hearth?,You Southerners build your big castles and you never move. You're easy to find.
2586,You're leaving now? It's the middle of the night.,I learned to walk in darkness.
2587,"We've been waiting a long time. Haven't we? Well I don't know, you tell me. How long does it take to sack a city?",It was just as you said. They did not believe until it was too late. Their slave soldiers threw down their spears and surrendered.
2588,And Daario Naharis?,"The city is yours, my queen."
2589,"They're good, aren't they?",They ought to be because they cost enough.
2590,"What? He's my nephew, I love him. And he's a damned fool.","Don't you drink, Lord Bolton?"
2591,"Don't you drink, Lord Bolton?","Never do, my lady. Dulls the senses."
2592,That's the point. Didn't you marry one of these Frey girls?,"Aye. Lord Walder let me choose any of his granddaughters and promised me the girl's weight in silver as a dowry. So I have a fat, young bride."
2593,"The Septon has prayed his prayers, some words were said and Lord Edmure has wrapped my daughter in a cloak. But they are not yet man and wife. A sword needs a sheath . And a wedding needs a bedding . What does my sire say?",To bed! To bed! To bed!
2594,It seems normal to you?,"It's tradition. Without the bedding ceremony, there's no real proof the lord and lady consummated their marriage."
2595,Boy or girl?,"I don't know. But if it's a boy, I know what we should name him."
2596,"Oh, do you? It seems to me the father should have some say in his son's naming.",Eddard. Don't you want to teach little Ned Stark how to ride horses?
2597,Eddard. Don't you want to teach little Ned Stark how to ride horses?,I do.
2598,Where are you going?,Got salt pork for the feast.
2599,Are you soft in the head? Turn this cart around!,I feel I've been remiss in my duties.
2600,"You ready to head home to Winterfell, eh?","Feast over yet, is it?"
2601,"Feast over yet, is it?","Aye, it's over!"
2602,And why I would let him do that?,"On my honor as a Tully, on my honor as a Stark, let him go or I will cut your wife's throat!"
2603,What are you doing?,I have a list.
2604,A list of people you mean to kill?,"For laughing at me? Do I look like Joffrey to you? No, death seems a bit extreme. Fear of death, on the other hand-"
2605,"For laughing at me? Do I look like Joffrey to you? No, death seems a bit extreme. Fear of death, on the other hand-",You should learn to ignore them.
2606,So how should we punish them?,Who? Whom?
2607,Who? Whom?,Ser Eldrick Sarsfield and Lord Desmond Crakehall.
2608,Why sheep shift?,That's the vulgar word for dung.
2609,Killed a few puppies today?,"Show him. Come on, show him."
2610,Roslin caught a fine fat trout. Her brothers gave her a pair of wolf pelts for her wedding. Signed Walder Frey.' Is that bad poetry or is it supposed to mean something?,Robb Stark is dead. And his bitch mother. Write back to Lord Frey. Thank him for his service and command him to send Robb Stark's head. I'm going to serve it to Sansa at my wedding feast.
2611,Let him make his threats. Hmm? He's a bitter little man.,"Lord Tyrion should apologize immediately. Unacceptable, disrespectful, and in very bad taste."
2612,You really think a crown gives you power?,No. I think armies give you power.
2613,"Oh, I know. Walder Frey gets all the credit. Or the blame, I suppose, depending on your allegiance. Walder Frey is many things, but a brave man? No. He never would have risked such an action if he didn't have certain assurances.",Which he got from me. Do you disapprove?
2614,Which he got from me. Do you disapprove?,I'm all for cheating. This is war.
2615,So that's why you did it? To save lives?,"To end the war. To protect the family. Do you want to write a song for the dead Starks? Go ahead, write one. I'm in this world a little while longer to defend the Lannisters, to defend my blood."
2616,"To end the war. To protect the family. Do you want to write a song for the dead Starks? Go ahead, write one. I'm in this world a little while longer to defend the Lannisters, to defend my blood.",The Northerners will never forget.
2617,Do you think she'll open her legs for me after I tell her how we murdered her mother and brother?,"One way or another, you will get that girl pregnant."
2618,Shall I explain to you in one easy lesson how the world works?,Use small words. I'm not as bright as you.
2619,Does that amuse you?,"No, it's a very good lesson. Only it's easy for you to preach utter devotion to family when you're making all the decisions."
2620,"Easy for me, is it?",When have you ever done something that wasn't in your interest but solely for the benefit of the family?
2621,When have you ever done something that wasn't in your interest but solely for the benefit of the family?,"The day that you were born. I wanted to carry you into the sea and let the waves wash you away. Instead, I let you live. And I brought you as my son. Because you're a Lannister."
2622,You'd rather be out there?,There are a lot of stories about this place. Horrible stories.
2623,You ever heard about the Rat Cook?,No. Who's he?
2624,No. Who's he?,"Just a cook in the Night's Watch. He was angry at the king for something, I don't remember. When the king was visiting the Nightfort, the cook killed the king's son, cooked him into a big pie with onions, carrots, mushrooms and bacon. That night he served the pie to the king. He liked the taste of his son so much, he asked for a second slice. The gods turned the cook into a giant white rat who could only eat his own young. He's been roaming the Nightfort ever since, devouring his own babies. But no matter what he does, he's always hungry."
2625,An old man on the run with no allies. I have Tywin Lannister backing me. Who does he have?,As you say.
2626,"They all laughed at me, all those high lords. They all thought they were better than me. Ned Stark, Hoster Tully. People snigger when I marry a young girl, but who said a word when Jon Arryn married the little Tully bitch?",You'll be needing a new young girl.
2627,Calling himself the Young Wolf. How's that for pomposity?,"Well, here's to the Young Wolf!"
2628,Will you move to Winterfell now that the war's over?,At some point perhaps. But Winterfell's in ruins.
2629,"Yeah. What happened up there? I heard the Greyjoy boy seized the place. I heard he killed all the ravens. And after that, nothing.",I sent my bastard Ramsay to root him out. Robb Stark offered amnesty for the Ironborn if they gave us Theon.
2630,Oh. And?,Ramsay delivered the terms. The Ironborn turned on Theon as we knew they would. They handed him over trussed and hooded. But Ramsay- well Ramsay has his own way of doing things.
2631,What? No. Pork sausage. You think I'm some sort of savage?,People talk about phantom limbs. An amputee might have an itch where his foot used to be. So I've always wondered do eunuchs have a phantom cock?
2632,People talk about phantom limbs. An amputee might have an itch where his foot used to be. So I've always wondered do eunuchs have a phantom cock?,"Next time you think about naked girls, would you feel an itch?"
2633,"Next time you think about naked girls, would you feel an itch?",Sorry. I shouldn't make jokes. My mother taught me not to throw stones at cripples.
2634,"Sorry, what?",A little louder.
2635,"You don't look like a Theon Greyjoy anymore. That's a name for a lord. But you're not a lord, are you? You're just meat.",Stinking meat.
2636,You reek. Reek! That's a good name for you. What's your name?,Theon Greyjoy.
2637,What's your name?,Th- Theon Greyjoy.
2638,What is your name?!,Reek. My name is Reek.
2639,Who are you?,Sam! Sam!
2640,Who are you?!,Gilly. Don't hurt us.
2641,Where are you going?,To Castle Black. I'm a brother of the Night's Watch.
2642,Who's your brother?,Doesn't matter.
2643,What? Why in the world would you want to go-,I don't want to. I have to.
2644,How did you get through the Wall?,Does the well lead to an underground river? Is that how you came here?
2645,Does the well lead to an underground river? Is that how you came here?,Come with us. There are steps carved into the south side of the Wall. Hodor can carry you to the top. We'll walk straight to Castle Black.
2646,How do you know all that?,The Night's Watch can't stop them. The kings of Westeros and all their armies can't stop them.
2647,But you're going to stop them?,"Please, Sam. I have to go north. I have to."
2648,Son? He's not a man anymore.,He's your son. He's my brother. He's a Greyjoy.
2649,What is it?,Dragonglass.
2650,Why? What are they for?,Killing White Walkers.
2651,How do you know that?,The Walker came for my baby. And Sam-
2652,How are you keeping?,Great. Never better.
2653,"I should have known. Every time a highborn asks my name, it's trouble. We're not really people to you, are we? Just a million different ways to get what you want.",I'm not a highborn.
2654,How far below? How close to the Red Keep were you?,The shit that poured from their privy pipes flowed down the side of Aegon's Hill along Tanner's Row and right in front of my front door on Gin Alley.
2655,"The Street of Steel, with your armor and your knights? Pfft. You lived in the fancy part of town. And here we are now. Two boys from Flea Bottom in the castle of a king.","Yeah, we've come a long way. We're all the same, really. She went to great pains to point that out to me."
2656,"If you mistrust fancy people so much, why were you in such a hurry to trust her?","You're me. Never been with a woman. Never talked to a woman, really. And then she comes at you- big words, no clothes. What would you have done?"
2657,"You're me. Never been with a woman. Never talked to a woman, really. And then she comes at you- big words, no clothes. What would you have done?","She does know her way around a man's head, I'll give her that."
2658,So how'd you become a lord?,"Oh, that's a long story."
2659,You see? Highborns.,I didn't want to be a lord. I nearly didn't accept.
2660,Why did you?,I did it for my son. I didn't want him to step over a river of shit every time he stepped through his front door. I wanted him to have a better life.
2661,Does he?,He's dead.
2662,How'd he die?,Following me.
2663,When did you come to this strange country?,When I was thirteen.
2664,I love that girl. I would kill for her. Do you think that makes it easier for me?,"No, I expect not."
2665,"What do you want from me, Lord Varys?","Diamonds. I'd tell you to beware carrying so much wealth, but you know how to protect yourself. Get on one of those ships. Sail to Pentos or Lys or Myr. You can buy a house with these diamonds, a very large house. Hire servants. Start a new life, a good life, far from here. The mysterious foreign beauty. You'll have suitors lining up."
2666,Why do you want me to leave?,"Tyrion Lannister is one of the few people alive who could make this country a better place. He has the mind for it, he has the will, he has the right last name. And you- you are a complication. I know you love him. And I know it's true love not bought by gold and silver. I'm not asking you to leave him for money. I'm asking you to leave because your presence in the capital endangers him. This will never be your home, my lady. Find a true home somewhere far from here while there's still time."
2667,"So, enjoying married life? An unhappy wife is a wine merchant's best friend.",She doesn't deserve this.
2668,Deserve? Be careful with that. Start trying to work out who deserves what and before long you'll spend the rest of your days weeping for each and every person in the world.,There's nothing worse than a late-blooming philosopher.
2669,Will you be facing your marriage to Ser Loras with the same philosophical spirit?,I won't be marrying Ser Loras.
2670,You're not me. You want to make things better for Sansa? Give her a child.,So you can tell Father it was you who finally talked me into it?
2671,So you can tell Father it was you who finally talked me into it?,So she can have some happiness in her life.
2672,You have children. How happy would you say you are?,"Not very. But if it weren't for my children, I'd have thrown myself from the highest window in the Red Keep. They're the reason I'm alive."
2673,Even Joffrey?,"Even Joffrey. He was all I had once. Before Myrcella was born. I used to spend hours looking at him. His wisps of hair. His tiny little hands and feet. He was such a jolly little fellow. You always hear the terrible ones were terrible babies. 'We should have known. Even then we should have known.' It's nonsense. Whenever he was with me, he was happy. And no one can take that away from me, not even Joffrey- how it feels to have someone. Someone of your own."
2674,How long does it go on?,Until we've dealt with all our enemies.
2675,You sewed it on?,I did.
2676,What do you want?,Mind if I keep warm?
2677,Mind if I keep warm?,Fuck off.
2678,Does fuck off mean something different where you're from?,I've got money.
2679,What kind of coin is that?,It's worth a lot.
2680,Where did you get the knife?,From you.
2681,Is that the first man you've killed?,The first man.
2682,"I'm not a lord, my dear. Not for many, many years. Every man who joins the Night's Watch renounces all former titles. Among other things. What is your name?",Gilly.
2683,And the child?,She hasn't chosen a name yet.
2684,Tarly do you remember the oath you swore when you joined this order?,"He's not my child, Maester Aemon. She's one of Craster's wives. I remember every word of the oath. Night gathers and my watch begins. I am the shield that guards the realms of men. The realms of men. That means her as well as us. We didn't build five hundred miles of ice walls seve hundred feet high to keep men out. The night is gathering, Maester Aemon. I've seen it. It's coming for all of us."
2685,First night of the full moon.' Why is there a G in night?,I don't know. There just is.
2686,What is it?,Why are they ringing the bells? Are we being attacked?
2687,Why are they ringing the bells? Are we being attacked?,Stay here. Bar the door.
2688,And you take credit because you dropped a leech into the fire?,I take no credit. I have faith and my faith has been rewarded.
2689,"Do you know who had this table carved and painted, Ser Davos?",Aegon Targaryen.
2690,And do you know how Aegon Targaryen conquered Westeros?,"On the back of his dragon, Balerion the Dread."
2691,What is the life of one bastard boy against a kingdom?,Everything.
2692,What are you doing?,You're leaving.
2693,Is this some kind of trick?,"Yes, but not on you."
2694,Where should I go?,You must keep the coast on your left side until you reach King's Landing.
2695,They were looking for me for twenty years. Do they know your face?,No.
2696,You ever been in a boat before?,You know how to swim?
2697,You know how to swim?,Don't fall out. Go on.
2698,Why are you doing this?,Because it's right. And because I'm a slow learner.
2699,Pyp? Sam?,"Hush, now. You're home. Carry him inside. Gently."
2700,You don't deny it?,No. I let him go.
2701,Your mercy saved the boy's life. You feel good about that?,"Aye, I do."
2702,You saved one innocent. How many tens of thousands have you doomed?,There has got to be another way.
2703,What other way?! Tell us about this other way.,"I don't know, Your Grace. I can't see the future in the fire."
2704,Why am I gonna need you?,My king.
2705,When did you learn to read?,Matthos taught me before he died so I could be of better service to you.
2706,"You see, Ser Davos? You've been saved by that fire god you like to mock. You're in his army now.","They will come, Your Grace. When they're ready."
2707,What does it mean?,"It is old Ghiscari, khaleesi. It means 'mother'."
2708,Where did you get this much Valyrian steel?,From someone who no longer had need of it.
2709,Two?,The original weapon was absurdly large. Plenty of steel for two swords.
2710,Where's that written? I can and I will. The Kingsguard oath is for life.,The war is over. The king is safe. The king is never safe.
2711,How many people in this city alone would love to see his head on a pike?,Other knights protected the king while you were a prisoner. They will continue to do so when you go home.
2712,Home?,You'll return to Casterly Rock and rule in my stead.
2713,You know what they call me? Kingslayer. Oathbreaker. Man without honor. Now you want me to break another sacred vow.,You won't be breaking anything. There is a precedent to relieve a Kingsguard of his duties. The king will exercise that prerogative.
2714,No?,I don't believe I asked you a question.
2715,What do you want?,Supper would be nice.
2716,How many Dornishmen does it take to fuck a goat?,Please don't.
2717,"If he's so damned important, how come they sent you to meet him?",There's bad blood between the Martells of Dorne and the Lannisters of Casterly Rock. Has been for years.
2718,"And just in case the Martells of Dorne are looking to spill some Lannister blood, it may as well be yours, eh?",No need for cynicism. I happen to be an accomplished diplomat.
2719,Can you read the sigils?,Yellow balls?
2720,Yellow balls?,"Wild lemons on a purple field, House Dalt of Lemonwood. A vulture grasping a baby in it's talons, House Blackmont. A crowned skull, the Manwoodys of Kingsgrave."
2721,"And House Martell, a red sun pierced by a spear?","I don't see it, my lord."
2722,Will he?,And where is Prince Oberyn?
2723,And where is Prince Oberyn?,"Arrived before dawn. Not a man for welcome parties, our prince."
2724,Some accomplished diplomacy that was. Now where?,We must find Prince Oberyn before he kills somebody or several somebodies.
2725,How do you plan on finding a single Dornishman in a city this big?,"You're famous for fucking half of Westeros. You just arrived at the capital after two weeks of bad roads, where would you go?"
2726,"You're famous for fucking half of Westeros. You just arrived at the capital after two weeks of bad roads, where would you go?","I'd probably go to sleep, but I'm getting old."
2727,Look at this one. How lovely is she?,Beautiful. But pale.
2728,You like?,Timid. Timid bores me.
2729,"You're a bit of mischief, aren't you?","I think she likes you. ELLARIA"" She has good taste."
2730,"You're not timid, are you?",Not timid.
2731,Do you like women?,"When they look like her, my lord."
2732,A lie anywhere. Why not use the right words? I'm a bastard. She is a whore. And you're what? A procurer.,Any of the others?
2733,Any of the others?,The two girls can leave.
2734,"I am a prince, boy. Have you ever been with a prince?",Can't say I have. I'm wildly expensive.
2735,Which way do you like it?,My way .
2736,"You lost, friend?",Forgive me for staring. I don't see many Lannisters where I'm from.
2737,Why are you wasting a woman like this on a Dornishman? Bring him a shaved goat and a bottle of olive oil.,Do you know why all the world hates a Lannister?
2738,Do you know why all the world hates a Lannister?,You think your gold and your lions and your gold lions make you better than everyone. May I tell you a secret? You're not a golden lion. You're just a pink little man who is far too slow on the draw.
2739,You think your gold and your lions and your gold lions make you better than everyone. May I tell you a secret? You're not a golden lion. You're just a pink little man who is far too slow on the draw.,"Longsword is a bad option in close quarters. When I pull my blade, your friend starts bleeding. Quite a lot, I'm afraid. So many veins in the wrist."
2740,What are you? His hired killer?,"It started that way, aye. Now I'm a knight."
2741,How did that come to pass?,"Killed the right people, I suppose."
2742,"We'll need a few more girls. Girls, yes?","Oh, I partook. Now I'm married."
2743,"Prince Oberyn, if I may, a word in private?",Seems I visited the Lannister brothel by mistake.
2744,"Why did you come to King's Landing, Prince Oberyn?",I was invited to the royal wedding.
2745,"And butchered those children. My nephew and niece. Carved them up and wrapped them in Lannister cloaks. And my sister, you know what they did to her?",I'm asking you a question.
2746,Where's Daario Naharis? Where's Grey Worm?,"Gambling, Your Grace."
2747,Gambling?,Mhysa. Mhysa. Mhysa...
2748,How long have they been at it?,"Since midnight, Your Grace."
2749,What's the prize to winning this stupid contest?,The honor of riding by your side on the road to Meereen.
2750,You like this girl? Must be frustrating.,"You are not a smart man, Daario Naharis."
2751,Lemon cakes?,You love lemon cakes.
2752,How can you help me?,"I don't know, but I can try."
2753,Do you know what they did to my brother? How they sewed his direwolf's head onto his body? And my mother. They say they cut her throat to the bone and threw her body in the river.,"What happened to your family was a terrible crime. I didn't know your brother. He seemed like a good man, but I didn't know him. Your mother, on the other hand, I admired her. She wanted to have me executed, but I admired her. She was a strong woman. And she was fierce when it came to protecting her children. Sansa. Your mother would want you to carry on. You know it's true."
2754,"Will you pardon me, my lord? I'd like to visit the godswood.","Of course. Of course. Prayer can be helpful, I hear."
2755,What are you doing?,What does it look like I'm doing? Come here.
2756,What does it look like I'm doing? Come here.,How many times have I told you? You can't visit me here.
2757,How many times have I told you? You can't visit me here.,I know. I know. We have come to a dangerous place. Have you forgotten me? Do you know how long it's been?
2758,I know. I know. We have come to a dangerous place. Have you forgotten me? Do you know how long it's been?,Of course I haven't forgotten.
2759,I want you. Don't you want me?,Things are a bit tense right now.
2760,What things?,My nephew the king wants to murder me. My wife hates me because my father murdered her family. Oberyn Martell wants to murder everyone whose last name is Lannister.
2761,Don't you want to relax?,What's wrong?
2762,What's wrong?,I told you. It's not a good time.
2763,Do you love her?,Love her? I barely know her. She's a child. She despises me.
2764,Love her? I barely know her. She's a child. She despises me.,That's not an answer.
2765,Ship you away?,Give me diamonds and make me disappear.
2766,What in the world are you talking about?,"If you want me to leave, just say it. Say it!"
2767,You want me to stay?,"A work of art, really. The craftsmanship is excellent."
2768,Days?,"Better part of an afternoon. There, how does that feel?"
2769,"Better part of an afternoon. There, how does that feel?",Uh... a hook would be more practical.
2770,The symptoms have abated?,"Gone completely. I am in your debt, Maester Qyburn."
2771,"I've grown rather fond of him. He's quite talented, you know?",What symptoms?
2772,What symptoms?,Symptoms that are not your concern.
2773,You let him touch you?,You jealous?
2774,You jealous?,I'm surprised. You never let Pycelle near you.
2775,You think I'd let that old lecher put his hands on me? He smells like a dead cat.,I'm not sure I've ever smelled a dead cat.
2776,Why?,"Let's see, you started a brawl in the streets with Ned Stark and disappeared from the capital. My husband died in a tragic hunting accident."
2777,"You don't really plan on staying in the Kingsguard, do you?",Staying in the Kingsguard means I live right here in the Red Keep with you.
2778,I want... Not now? When? I've been back for weeks.,Something's changed.
2779,Everything's changed. You come back after all this time with no apologies and one hand and expect everything to be the same?,What do you want me to apologize for?
2780,What do you want me to apologize for?,For leaving me.
2781,You think I wanted to be taken prisoner?,Don't know what you wanted. You weren't here. You left me alone.
2782,I... What are you saying?,I'm saying you took too long.
2783,You plan on killing all the crows yourself?,Do you plan on sitting here scratching your balls till winter?
2784,Do you plan on sitting here scratching your balls till winter?,We wait for Mance's orders.
2785,"And what is it you want? March on Castle Black with just this lot? Your pretty crow said 1,000 men are nesting there.","Yeah, well, he's a liar."
2786,"He is? Shouldn't it be ""he was""? You said you put three arrows in him.",I did.
2787,Mance sent you?,How did you find us?
2788,How did you find us?,"You came from the south, not the north."
2789,Why does the meat down here taste so much better than it does on our side of the Wall?,Help yourself.
2790,"Fat and lazy. Easier for us, hmm?","You didn't see us coming? Lost your warg? And that baby crow you had with you, lost him too?"
2791,"You didn't see us coming? Lost your warg? And that baby crow you had with you, lost him too?",I'll answer to Mance. I won't answer to you.
2792,She yours?,I'm not anybody's.
2793,So you admit you murdered Qhorin Halfhand?,I didn't murder him.
2794,No? You put your sword through a brother of the Night's Watch. What do you call that?,He wanted me to kill him.
2795,A bastard son of a traitor. What would you expect?,The Halfhand believed our only chance to stop Mance was to get a man inside his army.
2796,The free folk? Listen to him. He even talks like a wildling now.,"Aye, I talk like a wildling. I ate with the wildlings. I climbed the Wall with the wildlings. I... I laid with a wildling girl."
2797,"You admit to breaking your vows, then?",I do.
2798,Giants?,"Have you ever been beyond the Wall, ser?"
2799,"Have you ever been beyond the Wall, ser?","I commanded the City Watch of King's Landing, boy."
2800,How dare you?!,There's a band of wildlings south of the Wall already led by Tormund Giantsbane. I killed their warg and three others. They shot me full of arrows. Their orders are to attack Castle Black from the south when Mance hits it from the north. The signal for the attack will be a bonfire. Mance said it would be the greatest fire the North has ever seen. That's the truth. All the truth.
2801,Do you intend to execute me or am I free to go?,"None of us are free. We are men of the Night's Watch. But we won't be taking your head today, Jon Snow. Go on."
2802,And you always know when a man's telling a lie? How did you acquire this magical power?,I grew up in King's Landing.
2803,We know who you are. We've heard all about you. But hearing is one thing. Aren't you just marvelous? Absolutely singular.,I hear you knocked my grandson into the dirt like the silly little boy he is.
2804,A shadow?,"A shadow with the face of Stannis Baratheon. I swear to you by all the gods it was Stannis. He plunged his sword through Renly's heart and disappeared. One day, my lady, I will avenge our king."
2805,"All the Kingsguard will be on duty, of course. Ser Boros will be stationed here. Ser Preston will be stationed here beside the primary entertainment. Your Grace?","Yes, yes, one guard at the... the thing. Go on."
2806,"So this is the famous ""Book of Brothers""? All the great deeds of all the great Kingsguard. Ser Arthur Dayne. The Sword of the Morning. Led the attack on the Kingswood Brotherhood. Defeated the Smiling Knight in single combat. Ser Duncan the Tall. Four pages for Ser Duncan. He must have been quite a man.",So they say.
2807,Is there? For a 40-year-old knight with one hand? How can you protect me with that?,"I use my left hand now, Your Grace. Makes for more of a contest."
2808,Have you ever been to Meereen?,"Several times, Your Grace, with Master Kraznys."
2809,And?,"They say 1,000 slaves died building the Great Pyramid of Meereen."
2810,And now an army of former slaves is marching to her gates. You think the Great Masters are worried?,"If they're smart, Your Grace."
2811,"All right, what is this matter of strategy?",A dusk rose.
2812,Would you like to walk at the back of the train instead of riding?,And this one's called lady's lace.
2813,Would you like to walk without shoes?,"You have to know a land to rule it. It's plants, it's rivers, it's roads, it's people. Dusk rose tea eases fever. Everyone in Meereen knows that. Especially the slaves who have to make the tea. If you want them to follow you, you have to become a part of their world. Strategy."
2814,"You are a gambler, aren't you?",Your Grace.
2815,How many miles are there between here and Meereen?,"163, Your Grace. I'll tell our men to ride ahead and bury them. You don't need to see this."
2816,And? You made a promise.,To return the Stark girls to their mother who is now dead.
2817,"Well, Arya Stark hasn't been seen since her father was killed. Where do you think she is? My money's on dead. There's a certain safety in death, wouldn't you say? And Sansa Stark is now Sansa Lannister. Bit of a complication.",A complication does not release you from a vow.
2818,What do you want me to do? Kidnap my sister-in-law? And take her where? Where would she be safer than here?,Look me in the eye and tell me that you think she'll be safe in King's Landing.
2819,"Are you sure we're not related? Ever since I've returned, every Lannister I've seen has been a miserable pain in my ass. Maybe you're a Lannister, too. You've got the hair for it if not the looks.",It's all right. It's all right. It's all right.
2820,Yes. I have good reason to be. Once I was a knight. Now I'm only a fool. Don't you know me?,Ser Dontos. The king's nameday celebration. I'm sorry. I should have remembered.
2821,When am I going to get a horse of my own?,The little lady wants a pony.
2822,"Horses aren't easy to come by. Even if they were, you think I'm gonna put you on your own horse? Watch the only thing of value I've got in the world ride away?",Why don't you have any money? Didn't you steal anything from Joffrey before you left?
2823,Why don't you have any money? Didn't you steal anything from Joffrey before you left?,No.
2824,"You're not very smart, are you?",I'm not a thief.
2825,"You're fine with murdering little boys, but thieving is beneath you?",A man's got to have a code.
2826,You think I'm gonna escape? Where would I go? I'd be dead by nightfall without you. My family's gone. I've got no one.,"You've got an aunt in the Vale. Your rich Aunt Lysa. After I sell you to her, maybe she'll have enough left over to buy you that pony you want so much."
2827,What the fuck's a Lommy?,He was my friend. Polliver stole my sword and put it right through his neck. He's still got it.
2828,Got what?,My sword Needle.
2829,Needle? Of course you named your sword.,Lots of people name their swords.
2830,Pour our new friend some ale. What brings you so far north?,I could ask the same of you. What are you doing up here?
2831,I could ask the same of you. What are you doing up here?,Just keeping the king's peace.
2832,So I've heard. Stannis defeated at the Blackwater. Robb Stark killed at the Twins. And where am I for all of it? Stuck with your brother. Meaning no offense.,None taken.
2833,"He's good, the Mountain is. Best at what he does. But torture, torture, torture, torture. You spend enough time putting the hammer to people, you start to feel like a carpenter making chairs. Drains the fun right out of it. And what's life without a little fun?","But I don't need to tell you that, eh?"
2834,"But I don't need to tell you that, eh?",She's all right. I've had better.
2835,"You know what? You should come with us. His kind, they've always got something hidden away somewhere. Gold, silver, more daughters. Always something if you know how to make them talk. And there's plenty of him between here and King's Landing. You could do well for yourself. We certainly have been.",I'm not going to King's Landing.
2836,You got money to pay for it?,You paid for it?
2837,You paid for it?,"No. But we're the king's men. So, you got money?"
2838,"No. But we're the king's men. So, you got money?",Not a penny.
2839,You lived your life for the king. You're gonna die for some chickens?,Someone is.
2840,"Something wrong with your leg, boy?",What? What do you mean?
2841,What? What do you mean?,Can you walk? I've got to carry you?
2842,Can you walk? I've got to carry you?,Carry me?
2843,Carry me?,Fine little blade.
2844,Where is she?,"Tansy, Tansy, Tansy!"
2845,"You brought her down. That's what matters. A fine shot. Wasn't it, Reek?","A fine shot, master. My lady."
2846,Why? I did whatever you asked.,But you made Myranda feel jealous.
2847,Me jealous of her?,"My lord, please."
2848,"Your new hand, it's nicer than the old one. Wouldn't you agree, Pod?",Is it solid gold?
2849,Is it solid gold?,Gilded steel.
2850,You're not eating. Why is no one eating? My wife wastes away and my brother starves himself.,I'm not hungry.
2851,What about your left?,"I can hold a sword, but all my instincts are wrong. How can I protect the king when I can hardly wipe my own ass?"
2852,"I can hold a sword, but all my instincts are wrong. How can I protect the king when I can hardly wipe my own ass?",You're the Lord Commander now. Command. Let others do the fighting. When was the last time Father used a sword?
2853,You're the Lord Commander now. Command. Let others do the fighting. When was the last time Father used a sword?,I'm not Father. I'm the Kingslayer. When people find out I can't slay a pigeon...
2854,"With whom? You? Men talk. Soon as someone discovers I can't fight, he'll tell everyone.","You need a proper, discreet swordsman. As it happens, I have just the one."
2855,Is this place safe?,"There's this knight, Leygood, got thunderbolts on his shield."
2856,Plan on growing it back?,"Come on, then."
2857,Where is your prize?,With the hounds. I'll have a look at him.
2858,What did you do to him?,"I trained him. He was a slow learner, but he learned."
2859,You sent terms to Balon Greyjoy without my consent?,You made me acting Lord of the Dreadfort. I acted.
2860,"Reek, how could you let me stand before my father unshaven? It's disrespectful.","I'm sorry, my lord."
2861,"If I'm not a Bolton, Father, what does it matter?","Go on, Reek. A nice close shave."
2862,"Reek, tell Father where are Bran and Rickon Stark?","I don't know, my lord."
2863,"Reek, did you murder the Stark boys?","No, my lord. Just two farm boys."
2864,"Oh, that's right, Reek. Robb Stark is dead. Sorry. I know he was like a brother to you. But my father put a knife through his heart. How do you feel about that?",You ready for a hunt?
2865,You ready for a hunt?,Always. Find those boys and I'll give you a thousand acres and a holdfast.
2866,Your pet rat have any thoughts on which way they went after Winterfell?,Jon Snow is at Castle Black.
2867,Who the fuck is Jon Snow?,Their bastard brother. He could be sheltering them. He may know where they are.
2868,"You want to prove yourself a Bolton? Gather whatever men you can and ride for Moat Cailin. Bring this creature of yours. Maybe he'll be of some use. Take the Moat for the family, for our family, and I'll reconsider your position.",Lord Varys. Breakfasting with the king?
2869,Lord Varys. Breakfasting with the king?,I'm afraid foreigners aren't welcome at such exclusive affairs.
2870,"No, I will not. How long do you imagine your father and sister would let me live if they suspected me of lying? I have no pet sellsword to protect me. No legendary brother to avenge me. Only little birds who whisper in my ear.",Forgive me if I don't weep for you.
2871,Your father has promised to hang the next whore he finds you with. Have you ever known your father to make an idle threat?,"From House Tyrell and the people of the Reach, Your Grace, it is my honor to present you with this wedding cup."
2872,"A handsome goblet, my lord. Or shall I call you Father?","I shall be honored, Your Grace."
2873,A book?,"The Lives of Four Kings."" Grand Maester Kaeth's history of the reigns of Daeron the Young Dragon, Baelor the Blessed, Aegon the Unworthy, and Daeron the Good. A book every king should read."
2874,Such a great sword should have a name. What shall I call her?,Stormbringer.
2875,"You want me on the desk? What's wrong, my lion?",Don't call me that.
2876,What should I call you?,I'm afraid our friendship can't continue.
2877,Our friendship?,There's a ship waiting in the harbor bound for Pentos.
2878,What?,"You'll have your own cabin, of course, and, across the Narrow Sea, a house, servants."
2879,What is this?,"I'm a married man. My wife has suffered a great deal, as you well know. I don't want her to suffer anymore on my account. I need to uphold my vows."
2880,What are you afraid of?,I'm not afraid.
2881,You are. You are afraid of your father and your sister. You're going to run from them all your life?,I need you to leave.
2882,You're a whore! Sansa is fit to bear my children and you are not. I can't be in love with a whore. I can't have children with a whore. How many men have you been with? Five hundred? Five thousand?,How many whores have you been with?
2883,How many whores have you been with?,I have enjoyed my time with all of them and I have enjoyed my time with you most of all. But now that time is over.
2884,Did you see? Their souls. It was their souls. Our lord took them. Did you see?,Lord Florent was your brother by law.
2885,How many ships did he bring to your 'cause? How many men?,A good deal more than you.
2886,"Did you see, Ser Davos? They're with our lord now. Their sins all burned away. Did you see?","I'm sure they're more than grateful, my queen."
2887,"When Storm's End was under siege and I was starving, Stannis boiled soup for me from books. The binding glue is made from horses. One morning, he shot two seagulls on the beach. I've never tasted anything as good as grilled seagull. Do you remember?",Of course I remember.
2888,"Have you ever known true hunger, my lady?",It's all I knew when I was a child.
2889,Until you found the Lord of Light?,Until he found me.
2890,You barely know her. You think she's sweet because she smiles when you visit. She's sullen and stubborn and sinful. Why else would the Lord of Light have seen fit to mark her face? She needs the rod.,She's my daughter. You will not strike her.
2891,"Were you sleeping, Princess?",Did you watch the ceremony on the beach?
2892,Did you watch the ceremony on the beach?,I heard it.
2893,And it frightened you?,Ser Axell was my uncle. He was always kind to me.
2894,"You have so many questions, don't you? So did I when I was a child. I was much like you. Only I wasn't a princess.",And you didn't have this.
2895,"No. But I suffered in other ways, sweet girl, believe me. What do you know of the gods?","I read ""The Seven-Pointed Star."""
2896,There are no seven heavens and no seven hells?,"There's only one hell, Princess. The one we live in now."
2897,Why did you wake me?,You've been gone for hours.
2898,"Bit much, wouldn't you say?",It feels proportionate.
2899,Proportionate to what?,The expected extravagance.
2900,Shall we stick golden roses in half the meat pies to commemorate your generosity?,"No, your heartfelt thank you is its own reward. I would imagine I'd be hearing it again before long. Wars are rather expensive. ""The Iron Bank will have it's due."" How they love to remind everyone. Almost as much as you Lannisters with your debts."
2901,You saw her board the ship?,"Aye, she's on it."
2902,You saw the ship sail away?,"No one knows she's there but you, me, and Varys."
2903,How do you know?,"Because if someone follows me without an invitation, I'm the last person they ever follow."
2904,There's someone following you?,"She's gone. I know you don't want to believe it, but she is. Now, go drink till it feels like you did the right thing."
2905,"You look exquisite, child. The wind has been at you, though. I haven't had the opportunity to tell you how sorry I was to hear about your brother. War is war, but killing a man at a wedding, horrid. What sort of monster would do such a thing? As if men need more reasons to fear marriage.",My lady. My lady.
2906,"Lord Tyrion, you see? Not as bad as all that. Perhaps if your pauper husband were to sell his mule and his last pair of shoes, he might be able to afford to bring you to Highgarden for a visit. Now that peace has come and all is right with the world, it would do you good to see some of it. You must excuse me. It's time I ate some of this food I paid for.","A coat of gold / Or a coat of red / A lion still has claws And mine, my lord..."
2907,"My love, why don't we make the announcement?",Everyone. The queen would like to say a few words.
2908,"So, looking forward to your wedding?","Yes, very much."
2909,Did you just bow?,"Apologies, Your Grace. I never did master the curtsy."
2910,Did he? Haven't heard that story before.,"Not such a fascinating story, I'm afraid."
2911,Qyburn? Deplorable man. Brought shame on the Citadel with his repugnant experiments.,More repugnant than your gnarled fingers on that girl's thighs?
2912,More repugnant than your gnarled fingers on that girl's thighs?,"Your Grace, I am a man of learning."
2913,My little brother had you sent to the Black Cells when you annoyed him. What do you think I could do to you if you annoyed me?,I never meant to annoy anyone.
2914,"Bastards are born of passion, aren't they? We don't despise them in Dorne.",No? How tolerant of you.
2915,No? How tolerant of you.,"I expect it is a relief, Lady Cersei, giving up your regal responsibilities. Wearing the crown for so many years must have left your neck a bit crooked."
2916,"Who's got the gold now, Stark?",I am the rightful king.
2917,"Well fought. Well fought. Here you are. Champion's purse. Though you're not the champion yet, are you? A true champion defeats all the challengers. Surely there are others out there who still dare to challenge my reign. Uncle. How about you? I'm sure they have a spare costume.","One taste of combat was enough for me, Your Grace. I would like to keep what remains of my face. I think you should fight him. This was but a poor imitation of your own bravery on the field of battle. I speak as a firsthand witness. Climb down from the high table with your new Valyrian sword and show everyone how a true king wins his throne. Be careful, though. This one is clearly mad with lust. It would be a tragedy for the king to lose his virtue hours before his wedding night."
2918,"Well, how does he expect me to toast without wine? Uncle, you can be my cup-bearer seeing as you're too cowardly to fight.",Your Grace does me a great honor.
2919,What good is an empty cup? Fill it.,Kneel. Kneel before your king.
2920,Can we leave now?,Let's find out.
2921,"Uncle. Where are you going? You're my cup-bearer, remember?","I thought I might change out of these wet clothes, Your Grace."
2922,Your Grace?,It's nothing.
2923,"Joffrey. Please, Joffrey. Joffrey, what is it? Help him!",My son.
2924,Where is his wife? Where's Sansa?,Find her. Bar the gates of the city. Seize every ship in the harbor.
2925,Where is she?!,No one leaves the capital! No one!
2926,Where are we going?,Somewhere safe.
2927,Lord Baelish?,"Petyr... Are you hurt, my lady?"
2928,"Petyr... Are you hurt, my lady?",Good. Good. I'm sure you've had quite a fright. Rest easy. The worst is past. Ser Dontos shouts up from his boat.
2929,"I should get back before someone thinks to look for me. LITTLEFINGER First you'll want your pay. 10,000 was it?","10,000."
2930,"Shh. You don't want the queen to hear, do you? 1,000 gold cloaks are searching for you. And if they found you, how do you think they would punish the girl who murdered the king?",I didn't murder anyone.
2931,Why did you kill him?,Because he was a drunk and a fool and I don't trust drunk fools.
2932,"Saved you? My lady, he followed my orders. Every one of them. And he did it all for gold. Money buys a man's silence for a time. A bolt in the heart buys it forever.",He was helping me because I saved his life.
2933,I had it made a few weeks ago. What did I once tell you about the capital?,We're all liars here.
2934,So am I the queen?,"More than you were with Renly. Less than you would have been if Joffrey had done you the courtesy of consummating the marriage before dying. In any case, this would not be an opportune moment to press the issue."
2935,"The world is overflowing with horrible things. But they're all a tray of cakes next to death. They brought me your grandfather's body when he died, you know? Made me look at it.",What was it like?
2936,What was it like?,They took me to the Great Hall and there he was. The man I'd married and suffered to father my children. A great doughy lump I'd sat next to at endless dinners and tedious gatherings. There he was... lying on a table.
2937,Your brother is dead. Do you know what that means?,I'm not trying to trick you.
2938,"Yes, you will become king. What kind of king do you think you'll be?",A good king?
2939,A good king?,"Mm, I think so as well. You've got the right temperament for it. But what makes a good king? Hmm? What is a good king's single most important quality?"
2940,"Mm, I think so as well. You've got the right temperament for it. But what makes a good king? Hmm? What is a good king's single most important quality?",This is hardly the place or the time.
2941,Holiness?,Hmm. Baelor the Blessed was holy. And pious. He built this sept. He also named a six-year-old boy high septon because he thought the boy could work miracles. He ended up fasting himself into an early grave because food was of this world and this world was sinful.
2942,Yeah. A good king must be just. Orys I was just. Everyone applauded his reforms. Nobles and commoners alike. But he wasn't just for long. He was murdered in his sleep after less than a year by his own brother. Was that truly just of him? To abandon his subjects to an evil that he was too gullible to recognize?,No.
2943,What about strength?,"Yes. Strength. King Robert was strong. He won the rebellion and crushed the Targaryen dynasty. And he attended three small council meetings in 17 years. He spent his time whoring and hunting and drinking until the last two killed him. So, we have a man who starves himself to death, a man who lets his own brother murder him, and a man who thinks that winning and ruling are the same thing. What do they all lack?"
2944,"Yes. Strength. King Robert was strong. He won the rebellion and crushed the Targaryen dynasty. And he attended three small council meetings in 17 years. He spent his time whoring and hunting and drinking until the last two killed him. So, we have a man who starves himself to death, a man who lets his own brother murder him, and a man who thinks that winning and ruling are the same thing. What do they all lack?",Wisdom.
2945,Yes. But what is wisdom? Hmm? A house with great wealth and fertile lands asks you for your protection against another house with a strong Navy that could one day oppose you. How do you know which choice is wise and which isn't? You've any experience of treasuries and granaries or shipyards and soldiers?,"No. Of course not. A wise king knows what he knows and what he doesn't. You're young. A wise young king listens to his counselors and heeds their advice until he comes of age. And the wisest kings continue to listen to them long afterwards... Your brother was not a wise king. Your brother was not a good king. If he had been, perhaps he'd still be alive. Now, as the king, you will have to marry. Do you understand why?"
2946,"No. Of course not. A wise king knows what he knows and what he doesn't. You're young. A wise young king listens to his counselors and heeds their advice until he comes of age. And the wisest kings continue to listen to them long afterwards... Your brother was not a wise king. Your brother was not a good king. If he had been, perhaps he'd still be alive. Now, as the king, you will have to marry. Do you understand why?",A king needs a queen.
2947,"Yes, but why? To further the family line. Do you know how that happens?",Yes.
2948,"Yes, but has anyone explained the details to you?",I don't think so. It's all relatively straightforward.
2949,How are you?,I'm all right.
2950,You're a hateful woman. Why have the gods made me love a hateful woman?,"Jaime, not here, please. Please."
2951,Gonna rain soon. Where are we?,"Near Fairmarket, I think."
2952,You think? You don't have a map?,"No, I don't have a map."
2953,How far is it to the Eyrie?,Far.
2954,And you're sure we're going the right way?,"Believe me, girl, I want you there as soon as I can. Get my gold, be on my way."
2955,On your way where?,"Why do you care? Might book passage across the Narrow Sea. Fight as a sellsword. Second Sons, could be. Seems like a good fit for me."
2956,"Why do you care? Might book passage across the Narrow Sea. Fight as a sellsword. Second Sons, could be. Seems like a good fit for me.",I'd like to see Braavos one day.
2957,Why Braavos?,I have friends there.
2958,What do you want?,What do I want? This is my land.
2959,What do I want? This is my land.,"If I'm standing on it, it's my land."
2960,Which house did he fight for?,The Tullys of Riverrun.
2961,You got to do all seven of the fuckers?,Father!
2962,Did you fight at the Twins?,Call that a fight? Slaughtering livestock more like.
2963,Call that a fight? Slaughtering livestock more like.,The Red Wedding they're calling it. Walder Frey committed sacrilege that day. He shared bread and salt with the Starks. He offered them guest right.
2964,You got any ale?,Afraid not.
2965,How can a man not keep ale in his home?,"You look like you could really swing that sword. A real warrior with proper training. Those raiders wouldn't stand a chance against you. How would it be if you stayed on till the new moon? I could use a man to help with the farmwork. Sally does what she can, but she can't lift a bale of hay. And if any thieves came looking for easy pickings, one look at you, I'd bet they'd run the other way. Meaning no offense."
2966,"You look like you could really swing that sword. A real warrior with proper training. Those raiders wouldn't stand a chance against you. How would it be if you stayed on till the new moon? I could use a man to help with the farmwork. Sally does what she can, but she can't lift a bale of hay. And if any thieves came looking for easy pickings, one look at you, I'd bet they'd run the other way. Meaning no offense.",What'll you pay? I don't have much. But I have hidden a bit of silver from the bandits. Fair wages for fair work?
2967,What'll you pay? I don't have much. But I have hidden a bit of silver from the bandits. Fair wages for fair work?,Fair wages for fair work.
2968,What did you do?!,Get your horse saddled.
2969,There's plenty worse than me. I just understand the way things are. How many Starks they got to behead before you figure it out?,Raper. Raper. Horse thief. Ninth born son. Raper. Thief. Thief and raper.
2970,Going to visit your wildling whore?,She's not a whore.
2971,No? Maybe I'll give her a copper tonight and find out.,They all think I'm lying.
2972,About what?,Killing the white Walker.
2973,A what?,"Well, a wildling."
2974,"I don't know. It makes me sound a bit dangerous, doesn't it?",So... are you all right? No one bothering you?
2975,So... are you all right? No one bothering you?,I get a lot of looks. I hear them making their jokes. But no one's touched me if that's what you mean.
2976,Why do you worry about it?,"100 men, one woman."
2977,What about you?,What about me? Gilly? I worry about you.
2978,What about me? Gilly? I worry about you.,Thank you.
2979,For what?,For worrying about me.
2980,So what are you saying?,Maybe you'd be safer in Mole's Town.
2981,Are you bored of me?,Bored of you? I... I want to protect you.
2982,Bored of you? I... I want to protect you.,I'll get these to Hobb. Keep an eye on little Sam.
2983,You're a literary man now. What do you make of that?,Joffrey?
2984,Joffrey?,The usurper Joffrey Baratheon. I said those words when I tossed a leech into the fire. A leech filled with bastard blood. A bastard you set free. I am now faced with a great opportunity and I am powerless to take advantage of it.
2985,What progress have you made?,I've rallied House Peasebury to your 'cause.
2986,The Golden Company?,They've never broken a contract.
2987,"We're willing to use blood magic to put you on the throne, but we're not willing to pay men to fight? Now the Red Woman's magic is real. Her visions and prophecies may be, too, but I've never heard of visions and prophecies winning a war. Soldiers win wars. Soldiers on the ground. It's dirty on the ground.",We don't have any gold.
2988,What's the difference?,"Well, if you're a famous smuggler, you're not doing it right."
2989,You've sailed to Braavos?,"Of course. Almost got beheaded by a First Sword of Braavos. I tried to explain to him the difference between pirates and smugglers, but he didn't seem any more interested in the distinction than your father. I suppose if you work for the Iron Bank of Braavos and each one of your gold barges is worth half a kingdom, you tend not to be overly concerned with the kind of distinction..."
2990,What was that for?,I need you to write a message.
2991,"He's seen some adventures, hasn't he?",Precious little thing.
2992,What's his name?,Sam.
2993,Lovely. That the daddy?,No.
2994,Where's the daddy?,He's dead.
2995,Oh. Where you from?,North of here.
2996,North of here? You a fucking wildling?,Only room and board?
2997,Only room and board?,That's right. She'll clean and cook and look after the other girls' babies.
2998,I promise to come back and visit whenever I can. You'll be safer here. Who's gonna protect you at Castle Black? Me?,You protected me north of the Wall.
2999,No?,"I'm sorry. You're lovely, I just never acquired the taste."
3000,You're calling my beauty an acquired taste?,"That's quite all right, lover. It's more for you."
3001,You like them both the same? Boys and girls?,Does that surprise you?
3002,Does that surprise you?,Everyone has a preference.
3003,"What are you, 25?",Children.
3004,Did you?,He is a prince of Dorne. Girls and boys will line up to fuck him till the day he dies.
3005,May we have the room?,"Call my name if you need me, lover."
3006,Would you like to sit?,"No, thank you."
3007,Some wine?,I'm sorry about your grandson.
3008,Are you?,I don't believe that a child is responsible for the sins of his father. Or his grandfather. An awful way to die.
3009,Which way is that?,"Are you interrogating me, Lord Tywin?"
3010,"Are you interrogating me, Lord Tywin?",Some believe the king choked.
3011,Rather suspicious. Why haven't you thrown me in a dungeon?,You spoke with Tyrion in this very brothel on the day that you arrived. What did you discuss?
3012,You spoke with Tyrion in this very brothel on the day that you arrived. What did you discuss?,You think we conspired together?
3013,You think we conspired together?,What did you discuss?
3014,What did you discuss?,The death of my sister.
3015,"Here I stand unarmed, unguarded. Should I be concerned?","You are unarmed and unguarded because you know me better than that. I am a man of reason. If I cut your throat today, I will be drawn and quartered tomorrow."
3016,So you deny involvement in Elia's murder?,Categorically.
3017,Why?,"Not long ago, the Tyrells sided with Renly Baratheon. Declared themselves enemies of the throne. Now they are our strongest allies."
3018,You're saying you need us? That must be hard for you to admit.,We need each other. You help me serve justice to the king's assassins and I will help you serve justice to Elia's.
3019,You're a good lad. Any word of Shae?,"I've heard nothing, my lord."
3020,I suppose that's a good thing. What are they saying about me out there?,You're to stand trial in a fortnight for murdering the king.
3021,Do you believe I murdered Joffrey?,"No, my lord. You didn't?"
3022,"No, my lord. You didn't?","No. Gods, no. The world is a better place without him, but I had nothing to do with it. I would like to think if I were arranging a royal assassination, I'd plan it in such a way that I wouldn't be standing there gawking like a fool when the king died. Trial in a fortnight. Have they announced the judges yet?"
3023,"No. Gods, no. The world is a better place without him, but I had nothing to do with it. I would like to think if I were arranging a royal assassination, I'd plan it in such a way that I wouldn't be standing there gawking like a fool when the king died. Trial in a fortnight. Have they announced the judges yet?",Your father.
3024,Oberyn? Give it to my father. He never fails to take advantage of a family tragedy.,"I'm supposed to get a list of names from you, my lord. Anyone who might testify on your behalf."
3025,"Oh, I can call my own witnesses? How generous of them. Very well, my wife. Sansa.","My lord, she's gone."
3026,Gone?,No one's seen her since the wedding. You don't think she...
3027,"Yes, my lord?",They'll be following you now.
3028,Who will?,"I don't know. They. They. The ominous they. The man pulling the strings. Or woman. My father. Maybe Joffrey was too much work for him. Sweet Tommen will be so much easier to handle. Whenever something bad happens to me, I assume it's my sister that had a hand in it. But say what you will of Cersei, she loves her children. She is the only one I'm certain had nothing to do with this murder. Which makes it unique as King's Landing murders go."
3029,"Any other witnesses, my lord?",Varys could vouch for me if he dared.
3030,Why not?,They say he's a known cutthroat and your close associate. He's under investigation himself.
3031,And my brother? Will they at least allow me to see Jaime?,"I'll ask, my lord."
3032,Ser Podrick Payne? Has a nice ring to it. What did you tell him?,"I didn't tell them anything, my lord."
3033,Are you going to accept their offer?,My lord.
3034,"I will not have you dying on my behalf. Do you hear me? If I have to take that long walk to the executioner's block, I don't want to see your head already mounted.","Pod, I am giving you an order. Go and find my brother. Tell him I need him. And get yourself out of King's Landing before it's too late. Pod! This is farewell."
3035,What's she got boiling? Wait. Wait. Let me guess.,Potatoes.
3036,You know how to get to Castle Black?,Yes. Yes.
3037,Those your parents? Open your eyes. I'm going to eat them. Do you hear me? I'm going to eat your dead mama and I'm going to eat your dead papa. Go tell the crows at Castle Black.,We need to teach them a lesson about the way we deal with their kind.
3038,"You're a champion of the common people, Lord Snow. What do you say to Brother Pyp's proposition?","Mance Rayder is coming. If the wildlings breach the Wall, they'll roll over everything and everyone for 1,000 Miles before they reach an army that can stop them."
3039,What took you so long?,We were held up.
3040,By what?,Chains.
3041,And the mutineers stayed?,They're not going anywhere. They've got Craster's food and his wives. Poor girls. Never thought they'd miss their daddy. Karl's running things now. He's the one who put a knife through Craster's mouth.
3042,"It's not about justice. I told the wildlings we had over 1,000 men at Castle Black alone. Karl and the others know the truth as well as we do. How long do you think they'll keep that information to themselves when the wildlings are peeling their fingernails off? Mance has all he needs to crush us, he just doesn't know it yet. As soon as he gets his hands on them, he will. Then he'll throw his full strength at us. And even if every one of us kills 100 wildlings, there's still not a thing we can do to stop them.",I don't think I can kill 100 wildlings.
3043,Are they attacking?,A single rider. A champion of Meereen. They want you to send your own champion against him.
3044,What is he doing?,I believe he means to...
3045,"I have something to say to the people of Meereen. First, I will need this one to be quiet. Do I have a champion?","Allow me this honor, mother of dragons. I will not disappoint you."
3046,You sure you don't want a horse?,Why would I want a horse?
3047,Why would I want a horse?,Horses are faster than men.
3048,When they took you?,"When did they take me?"" I was five years old."
3049,"When did they take me?"" I was five years old.",You remember your home?
3050,You remember your home?,I remember when they rowed us away from shore. How white the beaches were. How tall the trees. And I remember my village burning. Smoke rising into the sky. Do you remember your home?
3051,I remember when they rowed us away from shore. How white the beaches were. How tall the trees. And I remember my village burning. Smoke rising into the sky. Do you remember your home?,"Unsullied. Always Unsullied. Before Unsullied, nothing."
3052,How are the lessons coming?,"Very well, Your Grace."
3053,She has a great army. You want to live the rest of your days in chains?,I want to live. You saw what they did to those children. What do you think they'll do to us?
3054,I want to live. You saw what they did to those children. What do you think they'll do to us?,"I've been through two slave revolts, boy. They always end the same way"
3055,Who are you?,"This one is called Grey Worm. I was taken as a baby by the Masters of Astapor, raised and trained as Unsullied. Now I fight for Daenerys, the Mother of Dragons and Breaker of Chains."
3056,You are Unsullied? They taught you how to fight before you could walk. We are not soldiers.,"We have no training, weapons."
3057,"Remind me, Ser Jorah, how many children did the Great Masters nail to mileposts?","163, Khaleesi."
3058,"Your Grace, may I have a word? The city is yours. All these people,they're your subjects now. Sometimes it is better to answer injustice with mercy.",I will answer injustice with justice.
3059,What the hell was that?,That was me knocking your ass to the dirt with your own hand.
3060,You learned to fight like a good little boy. I'll bet that thrust through the MadKing's back was pretty as a picture. You want to fight pretty or you want to win?,You talk to my brother this way?
3061,You talk to my brother this way?,All the time. He got used to it.
3062,Do you think he did it?,"No. Oh, he hated the little twat, sure. But who didn't? And poison's not his style. Or murder, for that matter. You want to know for sure, why don't you ask him?"
3063,"No. Oh, he hated the little twat, sure. But who didn't? And poison's not his style. Or murder, for that matter. You want to know for sure, why don't you ask him?","You haven't been to see him yet, eh?"
3064,"You haven't been to see him yet, eh?",We're done for today.
3065,Your brother ever tell you how I came into his service?,You stood for him in his trial by combat at the Eyrie.
3066,Aye. But only when Lady Arryn demanded the trial take place that day. You were his first choice. He named you for his champion because he knew you would ride day and night to come fight for him. You gonna fight for him now?,"To tell you the truth, this isn't so bad. Four walls. A pot to piss in. I was chained to a wooden post covered in my own shit for months."
3067,Is that supposed to make me feel better?,Maybe a bit. I'm sorry I didn't come sooner.
3068,"It's complicated, yes. So how is our sister?",How do you think? Her son died in her arms.
3069,How do you think? Her son died in her arms.,Her son?
3070,Her son?,Don't. You know what's coming?
3071,Don't. You know what's coming?,"My trial for regicide.Yes, I know. I know the whole bloody country thinks I'm guilty. I know that one of my three judges has wished me dead more times than I can count. And that judge is my father. As for Cersei, well, she's probably working on a way to avoid a trial altogether by having me killed."
3072,"So, should I turn around and close my eyes?",Depends. Did you do it?
3073,Depends. Did you do it?,The Kingslayer brothers. You like it? I like it. You're really asking if I killed your son?
3074,The Kingslayer brothers. You like it? I like it. You're really asking if I killed your son?,Are you really asking if I'd kill my brother? How can I help you?
3075,Are you really asking if I'd kill my brother? How can I help you?,"Well, you could set me free."
3076,What do you want me to do? Kill the guards? Sneak you out of the city in the back of a cart? I'm the Lord Commander of the Kingsguard.,"Sorry, I'd forgotten. I'd hate for you to do something inappropriate."
3077,Inappropriate? You're accused of killing the king.Freeing you is treason.,Except I didn't do it.
3078,Sansa couldn't have done this. She had more reason than anyone in the Seven Kingdoms. Do you think it's a coincidence she disappeared the same night Joffrey died?,"No, but... Sansa's not a killer. Not yet, anyway."
3079,Where are you taking me?,I'm getting married to your Aunt Lysa. She's waiting for us at the Eyrie. You'll be safe there.
3080,Did you kill Joffrey?,Did I kill Joffrey? I've been in the Vale for weeks.
3081,Did I kill Joffrey? I've been in the Vale for weeks.,I know it was you.
3082,And who helped me with this conspiracy?,"Well, there was Ser Dontos. You used him to get me out of King's Landing, but you would never trust him to kill the king."
3083,Why not?,Because you're too smart to trust a drunk.
3084,How do you know?,I just do.
3085,You're right. He wasn't involvedi n Joffrey's death. But you were. Do you remember that lovely necklace Dontos gave you? I don't suppose you noticed that a stone was missing after the feast.,"The poison. I don't understand. The Lannisters gave you wealth, power. Joffrey made you the Lord of Harrenhal."
3086,"I don't believe you. If they catch you, they'll put your head on a spike just like my father's. You'd risk that just to confuse them?",So many men they risk so little. They spend their lives avoiding danger. And then they die. I'd risk everything to get what I want.
3087,And what do you want?,"Everything. My friendship with the Lannisters was productive. But Joffrey, a vicious boy with a crown on his head, is not a reliable ally. And who could trust a friend like that?"
3088,"Everything. My friendship with the Lannisters was productive. But Joffrey, a vicious boy with a crown on his head, is not a reliable ally. And who could trust a friend like that?",Who could trust you?
3089,Who could trust you?,"I don't want friends like me. My new friends are predictable. Very reasonable people. As for what happened to Joffrey, well, that was something my new friends wanted very badly. Nothing like a thoughtful gift to make a new friendship grow strong."
3090,Have you been to see Tommen yet?,No. Have they even agreed to the match? No one tells me anything.
3091,No. Have they even agreed to the match? No one tells me anything.,"I wasn't originally meant to marry your grandfather Luthor, you know. He was engaged to my sister, your great-aunt Viola. I was to be given to some Targaryen or other. Marrying a Targaryen was all the rage back then. But the momentI saw my intended, with his twitchy little ferret's face and ludicrous silver hair, I knew he wouldn't do. So the evening before Luthor was to propose to my sister, I got lost on my way back from my embroidery lesson and happened upon his chamber."
3092,"But I do know. You don't think I'd let you marry that beast, do you?",What? I don't understand.
3093,What? I don't understand.,Shh. Don't you worry yourself about all that. You just do what needs to be done.
3094,Have you ever held a sword before? OLLY I was the best archer in our hamlet.,I was!
3095,Lord Snow. What do you think you're doing?,Grenn and I were helping them.
3096,You think I care if they like me? We're at war.,For now. But you can't be acting commander forever. There will be a choosing. The old maester will insist on it. You might reconsider his request to marchon Craster's. Let the mutineer stake care of Snow. Or you might be taking orders from him the rest of your life.
3097,"A bastard, eh? Took you for highborn.",My father was highborn. My mother wasn't.
3098,What brought you up here? A sense of duty. I wanted to do my part for the safety of the realm. I was a game warden in the Stormlands. Fed a prized partridge to my hungry kids. I was stupid enough to get caught. Chose the Wall over losing my hand. Figured I wouldn't have to suck up to any highborn cunts here.,"Come on, get on with it. What are you waiting for? Summer?"
3099,"Come on, get on with it. What are you waiting for? Summer?",Guess I was wrong.
3100,"You sent for me, Your Grace?",Your Grace. How formal of you. How many Kingsguards are posted outside Tommen's door?
3101,Your Grace. How formal of you. How many Kingsguards are posted outside Tommen's door?,Ser Boros is on duty tonight. Tomorrow I believe...
3102,So one? You have one man guarding the future king?,I promise you Tommen's safe. We're protecting him.
3103,The way you protected Joffrey? Why did Catelyn Stark set you free?,What?
3104,What?,I've been wondering for months. Ever since that great cow brought you back to the capital. Why did she set you free?
3105,I've been wondering for months. Ever since that great cow brought you back to the capital. Why did she set you free?,You know why. She'd hoped I'd send her daughters back to her.
3106,She hoped or did you promise?,"I swore by all the gods that if her daughters were alive, I'd return them to her."
3107,I wanted to get back to you. Should I have told hert o fuck off?,"You didn't mean it, then? You have no loyalty to Catelyn Stark?"
3108,"You didn't mean it, then? You have no loyalty to Catelyn Stark?","Catelyn Stark's dead. So if I told you to leave the capital right now and find Sansa, if I told you to find that murderous little bitch and bring me her head, would you do it?"
3109,"Catelyn Stark's dead. So if I told you to leave the capital right now and find Sansa, if I told you to find that murderous little bitch and bring me her head, would you do it?",I know you went to see Tyrion. That creature who murdered our son.
3110,And?,"He didn't do it, Cersei."
3111,Ser Pounce?,How did you get past the Kingsguard?
3112,How did you get past the Kingsguard?,Kingsguard.
3113,"Did you know that people in arranged marriages often never meet until their wedding day? Before we decide to spend our lives together, we ought to get to know one another. Don't you think?",Yes. But if my mother found out...
3114,"It can be our secret. Hmm? If we're going to be man and wife, we'll have a few secrets from her, I hope. So, Your Grace...",Yes? Tell me a secret.
3115,Yes? Tell me a secret.,Hello. Aren't you a proper fellow?
3116,Hello. Aren't you a proper fellow?,That's Ser Pounce.
3117,That's a relief. Because you know what happens when we marry?,"We say our vows in front of the High Septon. And after the ceremony, there's a feast."
3118,"When we marry, I become yours. Forever. It's getting late. I should go. May I come and visit you again? All right, then.","Remember, our little secret."
3119,See? He's a good lad.You'll get along.,Compliments of Lord Tyrion. His axe from the Blackwater.
3120,"What are you waiting for, a kiss? Ready the lady's horse.",They say the best swords have names. Any ideas?
3121,They say the best swords have names. Any ideas?,Oathkeeper.
3122,How fast could they travel? A crippled boy being pulled on a sledge by a simpleton?,I don't know. They'd pass wildling villages. They could try to find shelter at one of them.
3123,Craster's? You think Bra nmight have found...,Snow. I don't mean to interrupt. Thorne wants to see you.
3124,"I'm going beyond the Wallto Craster's Keep. I'm going to capture the mutineers holed up there or kill them. I'm asking for volunteers to come with me. There's 60 miles of wilderness between here and Craster's and Mance Rayder has an army bearing down on us, but we have to do this. Our survival may depend on us getting to these mutineers before Mance does. They know the Wall. They know our defenses. If Mance learns what they know, we're lost. But if that's not enough, then consider this. If the Night's Watch are truly brothers, then Lord Commander Mormont was our father. He lived and died for the Watch and he was betrayed by his own men. Stabbed in the back by cowards. He deserved far better. All we can give him now is justice. Who will join me?",I can't let a recruit come north of the Wall.
3125,"Any command for us, Lord Commander? What's that? Fuck 'em till they're dead?","Did you hear that, boys? Fuck 'em till they're dead."
3126,"Did you hear that, boys? Fuck 'em till they're dead.",Rast.
3127,"You should shuty our fucking hole, ugly little cunt. You look likea fucking ballsack. Ugly. Look at your stupid cunt face. I could piss in any gutte rand soak five of you. Know how much they paid me to kill a man in King's Landing? Seven silvers. They told me a man's name and that man never saw daylight again. None of them cocksuckers got away from me.","Haven't lost a fight since I was nine. Maybe it's time. What do you think, eh?"
3128,"Haven't lost a fight since I was nine. Maybe it's time. What do you think, eh?","Maybe you're the man. Eh, cunt?"
3129,"Maybe you're the man. Eh, cunt?","I was a fucking legend in Gin Alley. A fucking legend! I would take any knight... any knight, any time. Fucking cunts in steel plate. Fucking cowards."
3130,What the fuck is that?,Craster's last child. A boy.
3131,What am I supposed to do with him? What did Craster do with 'em? Kill 'em before they could grow up and do the same to him? All right.,Don't need another mouth to feed. Hand him over.
3132,To who?,To the gods. The white walkers.
3133,Pink-eyed fuck. You thirsty?,Fuck!
3134,Do you hear that?,Is that a baby?
3135,Is that a baby?,It's coming.
3136,"Bran, what happened?","Summer, he's hurt. They've caught him in a trap."
3137,Who?,"I didn't see, but they have my brother's wolf. They have Ghost."
3138,"If Jon was here, why would they put his wolf in a cage?","They might have been Night'sWatch once, not anymore. We're not safe here.We need to go."
3139,Can you remember where the cage was?,The east side of the keep.
3140,This is nice. Fine leather. You're no wildling. Important. Highborn. Who are you?,"You see, where I come from, a commoner like me slaps a little lord like you, I'd lose my right hand. But we're a long way from home, aren't we? And the two of you, fancy-looking folks north of the Wall creeping through the woods. Isn't that a bit odd?"
3141,"You see, where I come from, a commoner like me slaps a little lord like you, I'd lose my right hand. But we're a long way from home, aren't we? And the two of you, fancy-looking folks north of the Wall creeping through the woods. Isn't that a bit odd?",I like your curly hair. My mom had curls like that. Beautiful brown curls. Why'd you drag a crippled boy all the way up here?
3142,I like your curly hair. My mom had curls like that. Beautiful brown curls. Why'd you drag a crippled boy all the way up here?,"See you haven't played this game before. A highborn hostage, that's valuable. But three of them, that's a lot of mouths to feed."
3143,What the fuck's wrong with him?,Come here.
3144,Who are you?,Please.
3145,"Yes. He wasn't, though, was he?","No, he wasn't."
3146,You still mourn for Joffrey?,He was my husband. My king.
3147,"You knew exactly what he was. I did, too. You never love anything in the world the way you love your first child. Doesn't matter what they do. And what he did, it shocked me. Do you think I'm easily shocked?",No.
3148,"The things he did shocked me. He's only a boy. A good boy. A decent boy. He always has been. Who was the last decent king, I wonder? He could be the first man who sits on that throne in fifty years to actually deserve it.","It would be some consolation, wouldn't it? For all the horror that put him there."
3149,"It would be some consolation, wouldn't it? For all the horror that put him there.",He will need help... if he's going to rule well.
3150,"A mother is not enough. You're still interested in being queen, I take it?","Oh. After all that's happened... It sounds strange, I know, but I am... I haven't even given any thought to it, what comes next. It would be a great honor, of course. But I will have to speak to my father about it."
3151,I won't even know what to call you. Sister? Or Mother? Hmm.,King Joffrey Baratheon is dead. Murdered at his own wedding.
3152,Who told you to take the Navy?,No one.
3153,So why did you do it?,I heard you liked ships.
3154,How many ships?,"Ninety-three, Your Grace."
3155,How many men can they carry?,"Ninety-three hundred, not counting sailors."
3156,Would that be enough to take King's Landing?,The Lannisters have more.
3157,How can I rule seven kingdoms if I can't control Slaver's Bay? Why should anyone trust me? Why should anyone follow me?,You're a Targaryen. You're the Mother of Dragons.
3158,"What, then?",I will do what queens do. I will rule.
3159,But how would they know?,You know what kind of stories poor men enjoy the most? Ones about rich girls they'll never meet.
3160,You know what kind of stories poor men enjoy the most? Ones about rich girls they'll never meet.,Is this the only way into the Eyrie?
3161,Is this the only way into the Eyrie?,"The mountains are impassable. If you want to get to the Eyrie, you need to go through the Bloody Gate. It doesn't matter how large your army is, if you attack this gate, you do it on this road, three men abreast and get slaughtered like goats. The first Lords of the Vale didn't have much, but they had these mountains and they knew how to use them. And the fortress they built here has never been overcome. Not once in a thousand years. Know your strengths, use them wisely, and one man can be worth ten thousand."
3162,Who would pass the Bloody Gate?,"Lord Petyr Baelish and his niece, Alayne."
3163,"Oh, do take down that hood, child. Don't you think know who you are? You think I'd let my intended leave the Eyrie on urgent business without knowing what that business was? I let him go so he could bring you here to me.",My flesh and blood.
3164,Make him fly?,Through the Moon Door.
3165,I don't believe that for a moment. Did he force himself on you?,No. We never...
3166,"Good. Robin, this is your cousin Sansa. But you're not to call her Sansa in front of anyone but Uncle Petyr and myself. Do you understand? Sansa, this is my son Robin.","It's a pleasure to meet you, Robin."
3167,What took you so long?,"Arranging for the ascension of King Tommen I, extricating Sansa, getting her here alive."
3168,Ought we not... inform the Lords of the Vale about the ceremony?,"There's only one Lord of the Vale. The others can all hang. Lurking and simpering on the stairs like buzzards the moment my husband died, trying to get their claws in me."
3169,"I'm done waiting, Petyr. We had our wedding night many years ago. Or don't you remember?",Like it was yesterday.
3170,"What wife would do for you the things I've done for you? What wife would trust you the way I've trusted you? When you gave me those drops and told me to pour them into Jon's wine, my husbando s wine... when you told me to write a letter to Cat telling her it was the Lannisters...",The deed is done. Faded into nothing. Only speaking of it can make it real.
3171,When will the wedding take place in your mind?,As soon as decency permits. After we've allowed Tommen the appropriate time to mourn his brother and Margaery to mourn her husband.
3172,A fortnight?,That seems reasonable.
3173,And your wedding to Loras?,Shortly after Tommen's.
3174,Shortly?,A fortnight.
3175,Then whom can we trust?,Ourselves alone.
3176,Do you know how much gold was mined in the Westerlands this past year?,Haven't a clue.
3177,"Pounds, tons, ounces?",Doesn't matter. The answer is the same.
3178,Then how do we pay for anything?,The crown owes the Iron Bank of Braavos a tremendous amount of money.
3179,How much?,A tremendous amount.
3180,The Lannister legacy is the only thing that matters. You've started wars to protect this family. Turned your back on Jaime for refusing to contribute to its future. What does Tyrion deserve for lighting that future on fire?,Joffrey. Cersei. Walder Frey. Meryn Trant. Tywin Lannister. The Red Woman. Beric Dondarrion. Thoros of Myr. Ilyn Payne. The Mountain.
3181,Would you shut up?,I can't sleep until I say the names.
3182,The names of every fucking person in Westeros?,Only the ones I'm going to kill.
3183,"If he were here right now, what would you do?","I'd tell him to shut the fuck up so I can get some sleep. Go on, get it over with, your list of doomed men."
3184,"Your mother always had a sweet tooth, you know?",Really?
3185,Really?,"Oh, yes. At suppertime, she would go straight for honey cakes, candied almonds, custard. Anything sweet. Eventually, your grandfather had to assign a septa to watch her at meals. Cat was the firstborn daughter after all. It was important that she remain desirable so Father could arrange a good match for her and she was starting to get fat."
3186,"My mother, fat? She never let me have my pudding until I'd finished all my proper food.","This is before she married your father and moved to the North. By the time you were born, your father's austerity had become hers. Marriage changes people. I didn't mean for you to stop. Go on, enjoy them. How do you like them?"
3187,"This is before she married your father and moved to the North. By the time you were born, your father's austerity had become hers. Marriage changes people. I didn't mean for you to stop. Go on, enjoy them. How do you like them?",They're delicious. Where did you get the lemons? You can't grow them up here.
3188,They're delicious. Where did you get the lemons? You can't grow them up here.,"Oh, gods, no. Petyr had three crates brought all the way from King's Landing. He knew you liked lemon cakes. He's so kind. He really cares for you. Think where you'd be without him. In their clutches and tried for murder."
3189,Why? Why does he feel responsible for you?,"Well, I'm half Tully. He loved your family so much."
3190,"Your mother never loved him. Never. Cat always went straight for the sweetest thing. The most obvious thing. Your Uncle Brandon. Your handsome, arrogant, cruel Uncle Brandon. He almost killed Petyr in a duel. And your mother loved him anyway. And now Petyr is risking his life to save you, the daughter of a woman who didn't love him no more than those whores in his brothels. Has he told you about them?",He hasn't told you about the vile things they do with their bodies? The vile things they let him do with their bodies?
3191,He hasn't told you about the vile things they do with their bodies? The vile things they let him do with their bodies?,"No, never."
3192,Are you pregnant?,"What? No, I told you. Lord Tyrion and I never-"
3193,"What? No, I told you. Lord Tyrion and I never-",I wasn't asking about Tyrion. What have you let Petyr do with your body?
3194,I wasn't asking about Tyrion. What have you let Petyr do with your body?,"Aunt Lysa, no, I-"
3195,Didn't they teach you how to ride a horse?,"Yes, my lady, when I was young. There wasn't much call for it with Lord Tyrion, though. He preferred litters."
3196,What do you think will happen if you leave?,They'll say I wasn't a very good squire.
3197,The hell you doing?,Practicing.
3198,"What, ways to die?",No one's going to kill me.
3199,Dancing? Maybe you ought to put on a dress. Who taught you that shite?,"The greatest swordsman who ever lived. Syrio Forel, the First Sword to the Sealord of Braavos."
3200,What do you know about anything?,I bet his hair is greasier than Joffrey's cunt.
3201,Was? He dead?,Yes.
3202,How?,He was killed.
3203,Who by?,Meryn Trant. That's why Ser Meryn-
3204,Meryn Trant? The greatest swordsman who ever lived killed by Meryn fucking Trant?,He was outnumbered.
3205,"The greatest swordsman who ever lived didn't have a sword? All right. You have a sword. Let's see what he taught you. Go on, do it for your Braavosi friend. Dead like all the rest of your friends.",Your friendo s dead and Meryn Trant's not 'cause Trant had armor and a big fucking sword.
3206,Prince Oberyn. Writing letters?,"A poem, actually."
3207,May I show you the gardens?,I couldn't very well refuse a royal escort.
3208,For your paramour?,For one of my daughters.
3209,"You have several, don't you?",Eight.
3210,Eight? Eight daughters?,The fifth is difficult. I named her after my sister Elia.
3211,"Perhaps that's why she's difficult. The gods love their stupid jokes, don't they?",Which joke is that?
3212,Which joke is that?,You're a prince of Dorne. A legendary fighter. A brilliant man feared throughout Westeros. But you could not save your sister. I'm a Lannister. Queen for nineteen years. Daughter of the most powerful man alive. But I could not save my son. What good is power if you cannot protect the ones you love?
3213,You're a prince of Dorne. A legendary fighter. A brilliant man feared throughout Westeros. But you could not save your sister. I'm a Lannister. Queen for nineteen years. Daughter of the most powerful man alive. But I could not save my son. What good is power if you cannot protect the ones you love?,We can avenge them.
3214,You really believe Tyrion murdered your son?,I know he did.
3215,"Everywhere in the world, they hurt little girls. Would you bring her a gift for me? I wasn't there for her name day. I don't know when I'll see her again.",Anything at all.
3216,Did you remove the skin?,"No, my lady."
3217,Have you ever cooked a rabbit before?,Did you ever cook anything for Lord Tyrion?
3218,Did you ever cook anything for Lord Tyrion?,"No, my lady. That was the cooks."
3219,What are you doing?,I'm helping you with your armor.
3220,What exactly did you do for Lord Tyrion?,I brought him his meals and cleared his table when he was finished. I kept his clothing and linens clean. Carried his messages and returned the replies. Mostly I poured wine.
3221,"Oh. Whilst in Lord Tyrion's service, did you ever do anything remotely related to combat?",I killed a man.
3222,Who?,A Kingsguard. He tried to kill Lord Tyrion at the Blackwater.
3223,How did you kill a Kingsguard?,I pushed a spear through the back of his head.
3224,What does that mean?,At the hill. A great weirwood tree.
3225,How... will we know the end?,You'll know.
3226,How many?,Eleven men. Most of them already drunk. No guards posted. They don't seem to have a care in the world. We'll carve them up like walnut pie.
3227,Have you seen what I can do with a knife?,Not yet.
3228,Why?,"They've got some hounds chained up inside. Closer we can get without the dogs sniffing us, the better."
3229,Stop. What are you doing?,Hodor. Hodor. Hodor.
3230,What are you doing? Leave her alone!,No!
3231,"You've got pretty hair, don't you? Now what is a pretty little highborn girl like you doing out here in the deep, dark woods, eh? You left your daddy's castle looking for trouble, didn't you? No dresses for you. You like it rough, don't you? You like it in the gutter, don't you?","If you let my sister go, I can help you."
3232,You can help me?,I can.
3233,And how you gonna do that?,I have the sight. I can see things.
3234,Have you seen what I'm gonna do to your sister? Have you seen what they're going to do to your sister?,No.
3235,Is Jon with you?,Aye. I'll take you to him.
3236,You're Brandon Stark?,"The little crippled lord. We're going for a ride, boy."
3237,Keep talking and I'll cut your friends' throats. Starting with the idiot. Do you hear? Do you hear?,Hodor! Hodor! Hodor. Hodor.
3238,You have to decide. Do you want to find the three-eyed raven?,Hodor.
3239,Lord Snow. Are you bringing me back for trial?,We had a good thing here. We were free men. You'll never be free. You'll never know what that's like.
3240,You learn how to fight in a castle?,"Some old man teach you how to stand, how to parry?"
3241,"Some old man teach you how to stand, how to parry?",How to fight with honor?
3242,How to fight with honor?,You know what's wrong with honor?
3243,You know what's wrong with honor?,You.
3244,Are you all right? Come with me. Come on.,We lost four brothers?
3245,We lost four brothers?,Five.
3246,What the seven hells could do that to a man?,I count ten dead mutineers.
3247,Where's Rast?,Here's another.
3248,Where in seven hells? Come here.,"I missed you, boy."
3249,What should we do with this lot?,It's not safe for you here on your own. Mance Rayder has an army heading this way and there's worse out there than Mance. Come with us to Castle Black. We can find you work. Keep you safe.
3250,You want to stay here in Craster's Keep?,Burn it to the ground and all the dead with it.
3251,"What can we do for you, Lord Stannis?","This is Stannis of the House Baratheon, King of the Andals and the First Men, Lord of the Seven Kingdoms and Protector of the Realm."
3252,And you feel your blood gives you a claim on our gold?,More than any man living.
3253,"Across the Narrow Sea, your books are filled with words like ""usurper"" and ""madman"" and ""blood right."" Here, our books are filled with numbers. We prefer the stories they tell. More plain. Less open to interpretation. How many fighting men remain loyal to you?","4,000."
3254,"And how many ships do you have? The ones still afloat, Ser Davos, not at the bottom of Blackwater Bay.",32.
3255,"And how much wheat and barley and beef and pork do you produce on Dragonstone to feed your 4,000 men on your 32 ships?",None.
3256,"As long as Stannis lives, the war is not over. Who's the real power in King's Landing?",Ser Davos...
3257,How old is Tywin Lannister?,67.
3258,"67. And when he dies, who's in command? A half-grown boy, the product of incest? Cersei Lannister, a queen whose people despise her? Jaime Lannister, a man best known for killing the king he was sworn to protect? When Tywin's gone, who do you back?",That is a problem for another time.
3259,"After the battle, the first mate asks, ""Captain, why do you call for your red shirt before battle?"" The captain replies, ""So that if I am stabbed, you will not see me bleed."" The next morning the lookout screams, ""10 pirate ships! We are surrounded!"" The crew goes silent.","They all look to their brave captain, waiting for his usual command. Calm as ever, the captain bellows..."
3260,You think they ever met a pirate who didn't tell them that joke?,Davos. I heard you were rotting in a dungeon in Dragonstone.
3261,We?,"You, me-- we."
3262,how fast can you run?,"Make for the ship, now."
3263,Reward?,"Yes, Reek. Those creatures who came in the night, they wanted to take you away. And you didn't let them. You remained loyal."
3264,"Do you love me, Reek?","Yes, of course, my lord."
3265,Pretend to be who?,Theon Greyjoy.
3266,"My father spoke out against crucifying those children. He decried it as a criminal act, but was overruled. Is it justice to answer one crime with another?","I am sorry you no longer have a father, but my treatment of the masters was no crime. You'd be wise to remember that."
3267,And what traditions do you speak of?,"The tradition of funeral rite. Proper burial in the Temple of the Graces. My father and 162 noble Meereenese are still nailed to those posts, carrion for vultures, rotting in the sun."
3268,And what of the slave children these noble Meereenese crucified? They were rotting in the sun as well. Would you have begged me for their right to a proper burial?,"Your Grace, I cannot defend the actions of the masters. I can only speak to you as a son who loved his father. Let me take his body down. Let me have him brought to the temple and buried with dignity so that he might find peace in the next world."
3269,How many more?,"There are 212 supplicants waiting, Your Grace."
3270,212?,"These meetings aren't always going to be this early, are they? I was up late last night. So, does this mean I am a master of something now? Coins, ships?"
3271,"These meetings aren't always going to be this early, are they? I was up late last night. So, does this mean I am a master of something now? Coins, ships?",Lord Tywin and I already determined that I shall be the Master of Ships long before you--
3272,The trial begins this afternoon. We only have the morning for affairs of state. Shall we begin?,"Sandor Clegane has been spotted in the Riverlands, my lord."
3273,What would it take to make the common soldier stupid enough to try his luck with the Hound?,10 silver stags seems a generous bounty.
3274,Make it 100. What else?,"More whispers from the east, my lord."
3275,The Targaryen girl?,Daenerys has taken up residence in Meereen. She has conquered the city and rules as its queen.
3276,Conquered with what?,"She commands an army of Unsullied, my queen. Some 8,000 strong. She has a company of sellswords-- the Second Sons. She has two knights advising her-- Jorah Mormont and Barristan Selmy. And she has three dragons."
3277,"How, my lord? By force?","Eventually, if it comes to that. Can your little birds find their way into Meereen?"
3278,"Eventually, if it comes to that. Can your little birds find their way into Meereen?","Most certainly, my Lord Hand."
3279,You seem quite knowledgeable about the Unsullied. Did you spend much time in Essos?,Five years.
3280,May I ask why?,Tis a big and beautiful world. Most of us live and die in the same corner where we were born and never get to see any of it. I don't want to be most of us.
3281,You are from Essos. Where? Lys?,I have an ear for accents. I've lost my accent entirely.
3282,I have an ear for that as well. How did you get here?,It's a long story.
3283,You did like boys before?,Really? Girls? Hmm. I hope you won't be offended when I say I never would have guessed.
3284,Really? Girls? Hmm. I hope you won't be offended when I say I never would have guessed.,"Not at all. But I was never interested in girls, either."
3285,What then?,Nothing.
3286,Such as?,"Let me guess, I've been pardoned."
3287,Really?,Father's orders.
3288,"Tyrion of the House Lannister, you stand accused by the Queen Regent of regicide. Did you kill King Joffrey?",No.
3289,"Did your wife, the Lady Sansa?",Not that I know of.
3290,"How would you say he died, then?",Choked on his pigeon pie.
3291,So you would blame the bakers?,Or the pigeons. Just leave me out of it.
3292,"Oh, why don't you tell them what Joffrey was doing?",Silence.
3293,By whom?,"By the accused, Tyrion Lannister, after he had me wrongfully imprisoned."
3294,"Grand Maester, you examined King Joffrey's corpse. Was it without question poison that killed him?",Without question.
3295,Was this one of the poisons stolen from your store?,It was. The Strangler. A poison few in the Seven Kingdoms possess. And used to strike down the most noble child the gods ever put on this good earth.
3296,Your own brother said this to you?,"Shortly before the Battle of Blackwater Bay. I confronted him about his plans to put Joffrey on the front lines. As it turned out, when the attack came, Joff insisted on remaining at the battlements. He believed his presence would inspire the troops."
3297,"Tyrion said, ""And you will know the debt is paid."" What debt?",I discovered he'd been keeping whores in the Tower of the Hand. I asked him to confine his salacious acts to the brothel where such behavior belongs. He wasn't pleased.
3298,Do you remember the precise nature of this threat?,"I'm afraid I do, my lord. He said, ""Perhaps you should speak more softly to me, then. Monsters are dangerous and just now kings are dying like flies."""
3299,And he said this to you at a meeting of the small council?,Yes. After we received word of Robb Stark's death. He didn't seem gladdened by the news. Perhaps his marriage to Sansa Stark had made him more sympathetic to the northern cause.
3300,"Father, may I ask the witness one question?",One.
3301,"You once said that without me, this city would have faced certain defeat. You said the histories would never mention me, but you would not forget. Have you forgotten, Lord Varys?","Sadly, my lord, I never forget a thing."
3302,You'd condemn your own son to death?,I've condemned no one. The trial is not over.
3303,As did I. Do you know the last order the Mad King gave me? To bring him your head. I saved your life so you could murder my brother?,It won't be murder. It'll be justice.
3304,Justice?,"I'm performing my sworn duty as Hand of the King. If Tyrion is found guilty, he will be punished accordingly."
3305,"Once you said family is what lives on. All that lives on. You told me about a dynasty that would last 1,000 years. What happens to your dynasty when Tyrion dies? I'm a Kingsguard, forbidden by oath to carry on the family line.",I'm well aware of your oath.
3306,What happens to your name? Who carries the lion banner into future battles? Your nephews? Lancel Lannister? Others whose names I don't even remember?,What happens to my dynasty if I spare the life of my grandson's killer?
3307,What happens to my dynasty if I spare the life of my grandson's killer?,It survives through me. I'll leave the Kingsguard. I'll take my place as your son and heir if you let Tyrion live.
3308,"Not going well, is it?",You're going to be found guilty.
3309,"Oh, you think so?","When you are, you need to enter a formal plea for mercy and ask to be sent to the Wall. Father's agreed to it. He'll spare your life and allow you to join the Night's Watch."
3310,How do you know?,Do you trust me?
3311,Do you trust me?,Keep your mouth shut. No more outbursts. This will all be over soon.
3312,Do you swear by all the gods that your testimony will be true and honest?,I swear it.
3313,Do you know this man?,Yes. Tyrion Lannister.
3314,How do you know him?,I was handmaiden to his wife Lady Sansa.
3315,This man stands accused of murdering King Joffrey. What do you know of this?,I know that he's guilty.
3316,How could you possibly know all this? Why would he reveal such plans to his wife's maid?,I wasn't just her maid. I was his whore.
3317,I beg your pardon? You said you were his...,His whore.
3318,How did you come to be in his service?,"He stole me. I was with another man, a knight in your lordship's army. But when Tyrion arrived at the camp, he sent one of his cutthroats into our tent. He broke the knight's arm and brought me to Lord Tyrion. ""You belong to me now,"" he said. ""I want you to fuck me like it's my last night in this world."""
3319,And did you?,Did I what?
3320,Did I what?,Fuck him like it was his last night in this world.
3321,"I am a whore. Remember? That was before he married Sansa. After that, all he wanted was her. But she wouldn't let him into her bed. So he promised to kill King Joffrey for her.","Father, I wish to confess. I wish... to confess."
3322,You wish to confess?,I saved you. I saved this city and all your worthless lives. I should have let Stannis kill you all.
3323,Tyrion. Do you wish to confess?,"Yes, Father. I'm guilty. Guilty. Is that what you want to hear?"
3324,"Yes, Father. I'm guilty. Guilty. Is that what you want to hear?",You admit you poisoned the king?
3325,You admit you poisoned the king?,"No, of that I'm innocent. I'm guilty of a far more monstrous crime. I am guilty of being a dwarf."
3326,Have you nothing to say in your defense?,"Nothing but this-- I did not do it. I did not kill Joffrey, but I wish that I had."
3327,"I'm sorry, what am I grateful for? The opportunity to live and die at the Wall as punishment for a crime I did not commit?","You threw your life away. You threw it away. It's not a joke. You understand that, don't you?"
3328,"You threw your life away. You threw it away. It's not a joke. You understand that, don't you?","Of course it's a joke, just not a very funny one. I couldn't- I couldn't listen to her standing there telling her lies. I couldn't do it."
3329,"Yes, I fell in love with a whore. And I was stupid enough to think that she had fallen in love with me. That deal you made, it was everything Father wanted. You do see that? He gets you back as his heir. The future Lord of the Rock. And he ships me off to Castle Black, out of sight at last. All so perfect. It felt good to take that from him. He knows I'm innocent and he's willing to sacrifice me anyway. He's willing to sacrifice any of us. Not you. You're the golden son. You could kill a king, lose a hand, fuck your own sister, you'll always be the golden son.",Careful. I'm the last friend you've got.
3330,"Where's your sense of adventure? Even if you lose, imagine the look on Father's face when you fall.",Our family name snuffed out with a single swing of the sword.
3331,Will you find him for me? Who does Cersei plan on naming as a champion? I hope it's Ser Meryn Trant. I'd enjoy watching Bronn disembowel that pompous child beater.,No. Not Ser Meryn.
3332,Who am I fighting?,Does it matter?
3333,Does it matter?,Could be food.
3334,"Where else to sit? Tried to walk back to my hut, hurt too much. Then I remembered they burned my hut down.","Who were ""they""?"
3335,"Who were ""they""?",I stopped asking a while ago.
3336,A bad way to go. Haven't you had enough?,Of what? I know. Time to go. Take matters into my own hands. The thought has occurred to me.
3337,Of what? I know. Time to go. Take matters into my own hands. The thought has occurred to me.,So why go on?
3338,So why go on?,Habit.
3339,Who are you?,My name is Arya. Arya Stark.
3340,You her father?,Her captor. Bringing her to her aunt for ransom.
3341,"A fair exchange, that is. Always held to the notion of fair exchange in all my dealings. You give me, I give you. Fair. A balance. No balance anymore. Could I have a drink? Dying is thirsty work.",Wish it were wine.
3342,The fuck you doing?,There's a price on your head.
3343,"And you thought you were going to collect it? Didn't think very hard, did you?",You were Yoren's prisoners when he was taking me to the Wall. He told me he'd fuck me bloody with a stick.
3344,This day's really not working out the way you planned. He on your little list?,He can't be. I don't know his name.
3345,What's your name?,Rorge.
3346,"All right, Jon?","Welcome back, brother."
3347,"I'm surprised you didn't ride over and say hello. The King-beyond-the-Wall is your old friend, isn't he?",We need to prepare.
3348,And how would we range north?,We wouldn't.
3349,"Coward. You would cut off our legs, pluck out our eyes, leave us cowering behind the Wall hoping for the storm to pass?",We can't defend the gate against a hundred thousand men.
3350,"Have you ever seen a giant, Ser Alliser? I have.",The bars on those gates are four inches thick. Cold-rolled steel.
3351,Are the stewards responsible for maintaining the tunnel?,No.
3352,Who would that be?,The builders.
3353,"Ah, the builders. First Builder Yarwyck, Lord Snow here recommends sealing the tunnel, leaving us unable to carry out our duties as sworn brothers of the Night's Watch. Do you agree with him?",No.
3354,Do you like 'em? Eh? Gloves are doeskin. Softer than a virgin's thighs.,I sent for you days ago.
3355,Doing what?,My lonesome bachelor days are over. I'm to wed Lollys Stokeworth.
3356,Lollys Stokeworth? She doesn't strike me as your sort of girl.,I wouldn't say I had a single sort of girl.
3357,"When my sister arranged this love match, did she mention that Lollys has an older sister?","Falyse. Aye, I did know about the older sister."
3358,And you understand the rules of inheritance?,Falyse is forty and barren.
3359,What? Ladies fall from their horses and snap their pretty necks all the time.,You and my sister deserve each other. Why did you bother to come here?
3360,You and my sister deserve each other. Why did you bother to come here?,"You once said if anyone ever asked me to sell you out, you'd double their price."
3361,Is it two wives you want or two castles?,"One of each will do. But if you want me to kill the Mountain for you, it'd better be a damn big castle."
3362,I have gold. What can I buy with gratitude?,You might be surprised. A Lannister always pays his debts.
3363,Does he frighten you so much?,"I'd be a bloody fool if he didn't frighten me. He's freakish big and freakish strong. And quicker than you'd expect for a man of that size. Maybe I could take him, dance around until he's so tired of hacking at me, he dropped his sword, get him off his feet somehow. But one misstep... and I'm dead. Why should I risk it?"
3364,"I'd be a bloody fool if he didn't frighten me. He's freakish big and freakish strong. And quicker than you'd expect for a man of that size. Maybe I could take him, dance around until he's so tired of hacking at me, he dropped his sword, get him off his feet somehow. But one misstep... and I'm dead. Why should I risk it?",Because you're my friend.
3365,"Aye, I'm your friend. And when have you ever risked your life for me?","I like you, pampered little shit that you are. I just like myself more."
3366,Why are you sorry? Because you're an evil bastard with no conscience and no heart? That's what I liked about you in the first place.,We had some good days together.
3367,What will you do?,I suppose I'll have to kill the Mountain myself. Won't that make for a great song?
3368,I suppose I'll have to kill the Mountain myself. Won't that make for a great song?,I hope to hear them sing it one day.
3369,"How did you get in here? Your door is well guarded,",But your window is not.
3370,So if I command you to stay in Meereen and patrol the streets?,I'll stay in Meereen and patrol the streets. Send me to kill your enemies. Any enemy anywhere. Let me do what I do best.
3371,Could you bring me that vial over there? The blue one.,"No, no, no. Not that one. You don't even want to touch that one. Next to it. That's the one."
3372,"If they're lies, my lady, aren't they best avoided?",Not always.
3373,Did you use it with Stannis?,No. Don't be upset. Men never crave what they already have.
3374,Why?,"You don't need powders and potions, my queen. You don't need lies. You are strong enough to look into the Lordo s light and see his truth for yourself."
3375,Jorah the Andal. Are you here to see our queen? She's in a good mood.,Khaleesi.
3376,You don't approve?,"It's not a question of approval, it's a question of trust."
3377,Why would I? The man's a sellsword.,Didn't you fight for the Golden Company before pledging your sword to my brother?
3378,Didn't you fight for the Golden Company before pledging your sword to my brother?,I did.
3379,Daario Naharis killed his captains and dumped their heads at your feet when he grew tired of their commands. How could you ever have faith in a man like that?,I could never have faith in a man like Daario. That's why I've sent him and the Second Sons to retake Yunkai.
3380,You have?,I have.
3381,And repay the slavers with what? Kindness? A fine? A stern warning?,"It's tempting to see your enemies as evil, all of them, but there's good and evil on both sides in every war ever fought."
3382,Hizdahr zo Loraq?,He will accompany the Second Sons and serve as my ambassador to Yunkai. He will tell the masters what has happened in Meereen. He will explain the choice they have before them. They can live in my new world or they can die in their old one.
3383,Why?,"Thought I stole one of his toys. I didn't steal it. I was just playing with it. The pain was bad. The smell was worse. But the worst thing was that it was my brother who did it. My father, who protected him... told everyone my bedding caught fire. You think you're on your own?"
3384,"Thought I stole one of his toys. I didn't steal it. I was just playing with it. The pain was bad. The smell was worse. But the worst thing was that it was my brother who did it. My father, who protected him... told everyone my bedding caught fire. You think you're on your own?",Let me wash it out and help you sew it up at least.
3385,Can I get you anything else?,"No, this will do nicely, thank you. Kidney pie is wonderful."
3386,"A good kidney pie is all about the ingredients. Flour, lard, water, eggs, milk. Easy enough. But the meat, peacetime or not, getting your hands on a good bottom round steak and calves' kidneys is not easy. I mean, some people settle for plain old beef kidneys. Got no right to cook anything, them. Oh, and the gravy. Don't get me started on the gravy. Very difficult to get right. See, a lot of people give up on the gravy. You cannot give up on the gravy. No gravy, no pie. Simple as that. That's nice armor. Are you a knight?",No.
3387,"Oh, it's just people with armor are usually knights. Generally speaking. From King's Landing, though, aren't you? From there myself originally. Flea Bottom born and bred. What brings you to these parts?",We're looking for someone.
3388,Someone in particular? Maybe they came in here. A lot of people come in here. Just the other day we had seventeen-,"A girl, tall, red hair, very pretty. Her name is Sansa Stark, but she may be using a different name."
3389,"Starks? What, like them lot from ""Winterhell""?","No, ain't seen anyone like that. I heard they was all traitors. Don't need no traitors in here."
3390,Sure I can't get you a bit more kidney pie?,What?
3391,What?,"It's nothing, my lady."
3392,My lady. My lord. Could I have a word?,What about? Not kidney pie.
3393,What about? Not kidney pie.,You seem like a proper lady. Someone who could be trusted. I never met no Sansa Stark. But I know her sister... Arya.
3394,When was that?,"Heading up north with the Night's Watch. She was all dressed up as a boy. Like your ladyship, only without the armor. Going by the name Arry."
3395,So what happened to her?,Well-
3396,"That's the one. If you find her, could you give her this? She liked the last one I gave her, but, well, this one turned out better.","Um, you were saying?"
3397,"Um, you were saying?","Her mother's dead, grandfather's dead, Walder Frey is the new lord of Riverrun. The Brotherhood isn't going to Riverrun."
3398,Why the Eyrie?,"Her aunt, Lysa Arryn. Catelyn Stark's sister. She's Arya's last living relative with money. She hates the Lannisters. Lord Tyrion made sure I knew which house married which and who hated who."
3399,You sure about this?,No.
3400,And what about what I want? Justice for my sister and her children.,"If you want justice, you've come to the wrong place."
3401,What are you doing?,"I'm building my home, Winterfell. At least I think I am. I haven't been back there in a very long time."
3402,Why did you leave?,It's a long story.
3403,When will you go back?,Probably never. My family doesn't live there anymore and someone burned it down.
3404,Oh. Does Winterfell have a Moon Door?,"No, I'm afraid not. It's not high up in the mountains. It's down on the ground."
3405,That sounds dangerous. How do you make people fly?,We don't.
3406,What do you do with all the bad people and the scary people and the people you don't like?,I never did anything with them at all. Girls didn't take part in that where I came from.
3407,Why did you really kill Joffrey? Tell me why.,"I loved your mother more than you could ever know. Given the opportunity, what do we do to those who've hurt the ones we love? In a better world, one where love could overcome strength and duty, you might have been my child. But we don't live in that world."
3408,"I loved your mother more than you could ever know. Given the opportunity, what do we do to those who've hurt the ones we love? In a better world, one where love could overcome strength and duty, you might have been my child. But we don't live in that world.",You're more beautiful than she ever was.
3409,"You wanted to see me, Aunt Lysa?","Come here, Sansa."
3410,Do you know how far the fall is?,No.
3411,You want her? This empty-headed child?,Let her go.
3412,She's just like her mother. She'll never love you. I lied for you. I killed for you. Why did you bring her here? Why?,"I'll send her away. I swear on my life. I swear to all the gods. Let her go, Lysa."
3413,"There's a man with an ear. Too bad you've got a hangnail for a cock. First time I saw you with your britches down, I thought you were a eunuch! You seen it girls. Like a baby snail peekin' out of his shell. *laughs and walks toward Gilly* *to Gilly* Your baby was crying this morning. It waked me up. You hear me?",Yes.
3414,"Well, what are you going to say?",I'm sorry it woke you up.
3415,"Hehehe, little Wildling bitch. You shouldo ve stayed with your own kind. *an owl hoots in the distance* Are you listening to me?",Shut your mouth.
3416,What? It's just an owl you dumb bitch.,No it's not.
3417,And we just cower in here while they slaughter our brothers?,Our brothers had orders to stay at Castle Black.
3418,"Oh, so it's alright then?! Black Jack and Kegs and Mully chopped to pieces 'cause they broke the rules?!",I didn't say it was alright! I'm sayin' they shouldn't have been there.
3419,How do a hundred and two men stop a thousand?,"Whoever dies last, be a good lad and burn the rest of us. Once I'm done with this world, I don't want to come back."
3420,You think he was spying on you?,"No, not spying."
3421,What?,I believe he was interested.
3422,"When the slavers castrate the boys, do they take all of it?",All of it?
3423,All of it?,The...the pillar an the stones.
3424,Haven't you ever wondered?,"Yes, your grace."
3425,Do you remember the name you were given at birth?,I remember nothing. Only unsullied.
3426,"When they cut you, do you remember that?",I'm sorry. I'm sorry they did that to you.
3427,Why? Why sorry?,It's a terrible thing to do to a boy.
3428,"Bracken. Mmm, strong. As long as they're in the see. But when you take them out of the water, no bones. They collapse under their proud weight and slum into a heap of nothing. You'd think they'd know that. Unfortunately they're not very bright. What do you tell them?","I'm Theon Greyjoy, son of Balon, heir to the Iron Islands."
3429,And what are you really?,I'm Reek.
3430,"Are you sure? You do look very much like a lord. Formidable, proud.",Until when?
3431,Until when?,Always. Forever.
3432,to Theon* No closer. Who are you?,"I'm Kenning, commander of this garrison. And you say you're Theon Greyjoy?"
3433,"I'm Kenning, commander of this garrison. And you say you're Theon Greyjoy?",Yes.
3434,And why should I believe that?,I was born on Pike to Balon Greyjoy. His third and last-living son. I am your prince. I swear it by the drowned god. What is dead may never die.
3435,"And if you were my prince, why are you marching with a Bolton army?",Lord Bolton took me captive after Winterfell. He sent me to treat with you in good faith as your fellow Ironborn.
3436,And what does Lord Bolton want?,You are fading from sickness. You are badly outnumbered and you're hundreds of miles from the sea. Lord Bolton implores you to protect your men and abandon this fortress you can no longer hold. Do this and he will be just and fair with you as he is being with me. The Boltons will give you safe passage to the stony shore.
3437,He wants us to surrender?,"My own father, your king, surrendered years ago to Robert Baratheon. I watched him bend the knee. There was no shame there. He fought with honor, as did you."
3438,No shame fought with honor. Only a whipped dog would speak this way. Or a woman. Are you a woman boy?,scared* You don't know.
3439,"You go tell your master that, Theon Greyjoy. Or whoever the fuck you are. What in the hell are you muttering?",Reek.
3440,"If we yield, we live? Is that what it says on this paper here?",Yes. Have your men raise the white flag and open the gates. You're going home.
3441,"You didn't really think I'd let them go did you? It's falling out of fashion. Fileting. Sad, but true. Traditions are important. Where are we without our history, eh?",Yes m'lord. Will we go home now?
3442,Yes m'lord. Will we go home now?,I believe we will. To our new home.
3443,"And when Jon Arryn named you Master of Coin, no one cared. Always been a grubby job. Why not let a grubby man do it? But when I heard you were lurking here, fawning over the Lady Arryn...",Lady Arryn invited me. She and I have been close since childhood.
3444,She was an odd fish. Everyone knew that. But suicide? She adored that boy of hers. I don't see her abandoning him. Not by choice.,"Strange that within days of your arrival, you've married Lady Arryn and she's fallen through the Moon Door."
3445,"Come closer, child. You have nothing to fear from us or him. Lord Baelish here is your uncle? Your name is Alayne? Perhaps you would feel more comfortable if Lord Baelish left the room.",My lady...
3446,"Sansa Stark? You tell lies right to my face, you little worm?","Lord Baelish has told many lies. All to protect me. Since my father was executed, I have been a hostage in King's Landing. A plaything for Joffrey to torture or Queen Cersei to torment. They beat me, they humiliated me, they married me to the Imp. I had no friends in King's Landing...except one. He saved me. Smuggled me away when he had the chance. He knew I'd be safe here in the Eyrie with my own blood, my Aunt Lysa. The Lannisters have friends everywhere. Even the Vale. He made me swear not to tell anyone my true name."
3447,"Not much justice to be meted out in suicide, is there?","For Lysa, no. But for her son? Only 20 years ago, the knights of the Vale rode behind Jon Arryn, Ned Stark, Robert Baratheon. They fought together to overcome the Mad King. And since then, Arryn and Royce, Corbray, Waynwood, all the great houses of the Vale watched from the corner. A timid boy at a tavern brawl."
3448,"For Lysa, no. But for her son? Only 20 years ago, the knights of the Vale rode behind Jon Arryn, Ned Stark, Robert Baratheon. They fought together to overcome the Mad King. And since then, Arryn and Royce, Corbray, Waynwood, all the great houses of the Vale watched from the corner. A timid boy at a tavern brawl.",Are you questioning our courage?
3449,Are you questioning our courage?,"I want to know which side you're on. Do you support the Lannisters, the house that executed your friend Ned Stark?"
3450,"I want to know which side you're on. Do you support the Lannisters, the house that executed your friend Ned Stark?",Of course we don't support the damn Lannisters.
3451,"No? Catelyn Stark begged her sister for support and Lysa refused. By staying out of the fray, you've allowed Tywin Lannister to destroy his rivals on every compass point. Who stands against him now?","Who would you have us back, Lord Baelish? Robb Stark is dead."
3452,"Who would you have us back, Lord Baelish? Robb Stark is dead.","I'd have you back Robin Arryn, Lord of the Vale."
3453,Yes? Who sent you?,Ser Barristan.
3454,Have I forgotten a council meeting?,No.
3455,What's this?,A royal pardon signed by Robert Baratheon. You spied on her.
3456,Who gave you this?,Does it matter?
3457,Does it matter?,Have you told her?
3458,Have you told her?,"I wanted to tell you first, man-to-man rather than go behind your back."
3459,Why did the usurper pardon you?,If we could speak alone.
3460,"Who do you think sent this to Meereen? Who profits? This is the work of Tywin Lannister. He wants to divide us. If we're fighting each other, we're not fighting him.",The pardon was signed the year we met. Why were you pardoned? Unless you're saying this document was forged.
3461,The pardon was signed the year we met. Why were you pardoned? Unless you're saying this document was forged.,It is not forged.
3462,"Why, then?","I sent letters to Varys, the spymaster of King's Landing."
3463,What was the content of these letters?,Information.
3464,What information?,When you and Viserys arrived in Pentos. His plan to marry you to Khal Drogo. When you were married. When your brother died.
3465,You told him I was carrying Drogo's child?,I...
3466,Yes or no?,Khaleesi.
3467,Don't call me that. Did you tell him I was carrying Drogo's child?,Yes.
3468,and you want me to forgive you?,I have loved you.
3469,"Love? Love? How can you say that to me? Any other man, and I would have you executed. But you, I do not want you in my city dead or alive. Go back to your masters in King's Landing. Collect your pardon if you can.","Daenerys, please."
3470,Walk with me. Has there been any word from Locke?,No.
3471,"Not nothing. The North. Ride 700 miles that way, you're still in the North. 400 miles that way. 300 miles that way. The North is larger than the other six kingdoms combined. And I am the Warden of the North. The North is mine. Now tell me, what is your name?",Ramsay Snow.
3472,Yes?,"First time I saw you, you were just a child. A girl from the North come to the capital for the first time. Not a child any longer. Why did you help me?"
3473,"First time I saw you, you were just a child. A girl from the North come to the capital for the first time. Not a child any longer. Why did you help me?",They would have thrown you through the Moon Door if they found you guilty.
3474,"If they'd have executed you, what would they have done with me?",I don't know.
3475,Better to gamble on the man you know than the strangers you don't? And you think you know me?,I know what you want.
3476,Do you?,"I thought it'd make me happy, but it doesn't. Not really. Nothing makes you happy."
3477,Like what?,"Killing Polliver, killing Rorge."
3478,So you're sad because you didn't get to kill Joffrey yourself. Is that it?,At least I could have been there to watch. I wanted to see the look in his eyes when he knew it was over.
3479,You protected him for most of his life. You think you could have saved him?,"I wasn't the damn wine taster. Little shit deserved to die, but poison...poison's a woman's weapon. Men kill with steel."
3480,You really think my aunt will pay for me?,"Aye, she'll pay."
3481,Who would pass the Bloody Gate?,"The bloody Hound, Sandor Clegane. And his...traveling companion Arya Stark, niece of your lady Lysa Arryn."
3482,Shall we go?,Wine always helps. I thank you for it. Trial by combat. Deciding a man's guilt or innocence in the eyes of the gods by having two other men hack each other to pieces. Tells you something about the gods. How much longer?
3483,Wine always helps. I thank you for it. Trial by combat. Deciding a man's guilt or innocence in the eyes of the gods by having two other men hack each other to pieces. Tells you something about the gods. How much longer?,Soon.
3484,"Do you think Oberyn has a chance? The Red Viper of Dorne. You don't get a name like that unless you're deadly, right?",I've never seen him fight.
3485,That's putting it mildly. What's the punishment for regicide? Drawing and quartering? Hanging? Breaking at the wheel?,Beheading.
3486,"Seems rather ordinary. And he was my nephew as well, so what is that? Fratricide is brothers. Filicide is sons. Nepoticide. That's the one. Matricide, patricide, infanticide, suicide. There's no kind of killing that doesn't have its own word.",Cousins.
3487,"Cousins, you're right. There is no word for cousin killing. Well done. Do you remember cousin Orson? Orson Lannister?",Of course. Wet-nurse dropped him on his head. Left him simple.
3488,Simple? Used to sit all day in the garden. Crushing beetles with a rock.,Khuu! Khuu! Khuu!
3489,Why?,"I was curious. Why was he smashing all those beetles? What did he get out of it? First thing I did was ask him. ""Orson, why are you smashing all those beetles?"" He gave me an answer. ""Smash the beetles. Smash 'em. Khuu! Khuu! Khuu!"" I wasn't deterred. I was the smartest person I knew. Certainly I had the wherewithal to unravel the mysteries that lay at the heart of a moron. So I went to Maester Volarik's library."
3490,"I was curious. Why was he smashing all those beetles? What did he get out of it? First thing I did was ask him. ""Orson, why are you smashing all those beetles?"" He gave me an answer. ""Smash the beetles. Smash 'em. Khuu! Khuu! Khuu!"" I wasn't deterred. I was the smartest person I knew. Certainly I had the wherewithal to unravel the mysteries that lay at the heart of a moron. So I went to Maester Volarik's library.",Volarik. Tried to touch me once.
3491,"Turns out, far too much has been written about great men and not nearly enough about morons. Doesn't seem right. In any case, I found nothing that illuminated the nature of Orson's affliction or the reason behind his relentless beetle slaughter. So I went back to the source. I may not have been able to speak with Orson, but I could observe him, watch him the way men watch animals to come to a deeper understanding of their behavior. *picks up a beetle* And as I watched, I became more and more sure of it. There was something happening there. His face was like the page of a book written in a language I didn't understand. But he wasn't mindless. He had his reasons. And I became possessed with knowing what they were. I began to spend inordinate amounts of time watching him. I would eat my lunch in the garden, chewing my mutton to the music of ""khuu, khuu, khuu"". And when I wasn't watching him, I was thinking about him. Father droned on about the family legacy and I thought about Orson's beetles. I read the histories of Targaryen conquests. Did I hear dragon wings? No. I heard ""khuu, khuu, khuu"" and I still couldn't figure out why he was doing it. And I had to know, because it was horrible that all these beetles should be dying for no reason.","Every day around the world, men, women, and children are murdered by the score. Who gives a dusty fuck about a bunch of beetles?"
3492,"Every day around the world, men, women, and children are murdered by the score. Who gives a dusty fuck about a bunch of beetles?","I know, I know. But still, it filled me with dread. Piles and piles of them, years and years of them. How many countless living crawling things smashed and dried out and returned to the dirt? In my dreams I found myself standing on a beach made of beetle husks stretching as far as the eye could see. I woke up crying, weeping for their shattered little bodies. I tried to stop Orson once."
3493,"I know, I know. But still, it filled me with dread. Piles and piles of them, years and years of them. How many countless living crawling things smashed and dried out and returned to the dirt? In my dreams I found myself standing on a beach made of beetle husks stretching as far as the eye could see. I woke up crying, weeping for their shattered little bodies. I tried to stop Orson once.",He was twice your size.
3494,"He just pushed me aside with a ""khuu"" and kept on smashing. Every day until that mule kicked him in the chest and killed him. *puts the beetle back on the ground* So what do you think? Why did he do it? What was it all about?",I don't know.
3495,You learn this during your years in the fighting pits? I always drink before a fight.,It could get you killed. It could get me killed.
3496,You're going to fight that?,I'm going to kill that.
3497,Have they told you who I am?,Some dead man.
3498,I am the brother of Elia Martell. Do you know why I have come all the way to this stinking shit-pile of a city? For you.,I'm going to hear you confess before you die. You raped my sister. You murdered her. You killed her children. Say it now and we can make this quick.
3499,"Wait. Are you dying? No, no, no. You can't die yet. You haven't confessed. Say it. Say her name. Elia Martell. You raped her. You killed her children. Elia Martell. Who gave you the order? Who gave you the order?! Say her name! You raped her! You murdered her! You killed her children. Say it. Say her name. Say it!",Elia Martell. I killed her children. Then I raped her. Then I smashed her head in like this!
3500,What was she like?,She...she had red hair.
3501,Oh? How big were her feet?,Well what do you want me to say?
3502,Well what do you want me to say?,I want you to tell me what it was like to have someone. To be with someone. To love someone and have them love you back. We're all gonna die a lot sooner than I'd planned. You're the closest I'll ever get to know it.
3503,"But if she had, you wouldo ve? You'd have broken your vows?","The interesting thing is, our vows never specifically forbid intimate relations with women."
3504,What?,"I shall take no wife"" yes, that's in there, there's no denying that. ""I shall father no children"" it's very specific. But what our vows have to say about other...activities...is open to interpretation."
3505,"Anyway, there's nothing for him to interpret. We didn't. So what's it like?","It's...there's this person, this whole other person. And you're wrapped up in them and they're wrapped up in you and...you...for a little...for a little while you're more than just you, you're...well I don't know, I'm not a bleedin' poet!"
3506,And what did I get for it? An arrow six inches from my heart.,There'll be arrows for all of us soon I imagine.
3507,Did I ever tell you about her? My Sheila?,Yes.
3508,And more words. Know what I think you do when you see him? Serve him up a nice juicy slice of ginger minge.,"What, you been thinkin' about that ginger minge? Wondering what it tastes like?"
3509,"What, you been thinkin' about that ginger minge? Wondering what it tastes like?",Maybe I have.
3510,"And what is it that couldn't wait until morning, Tarly?",Maester Aemon. How did you know-
3511,That it was you? Who else but Samwell Tarly would be wasting candles to read in the middle of the night?,Let me help you.
3512,"Oh, no need. I know my way around this library better than any other place in Castle Black. Thousands of books and no eyes to read them. Old age is a wonderful source of ironies if nothing else. But you didn't answer my question, what are you reading?",Maester Faull
3513,You were?,"You can imagine all manner of horrors befalling that poor girl and her child, is it so difficult to imagine that an old person was once, more or less, like you?"
3514,"You can imagine all manner of horrors befalling that poor girl and her child, is it so difficult to imagine that an old person was once, more or less, like you?","I'm sorry Maester, I didn't mean it like that."
3515,You know who I was before I came here? What I couldo ve been if I'd only said the word? Of course you do. I met many girls when I was Aemon Targaryen. A future king always does. Some of them were quite forward in their attempts to win my affections. One of them succeeded. I was very young.,Who was she?
3516,Who was she?,Ah ha. I could tell you everything about her. Who she was. How we met. The color of her eyes and the shape of her nose. I can see her right in front of me. She's more real than you are. We could spend all night trading tales of lost love. Nothing makes the past a sweeter place to visit than the prospect of imminent death. Go to bed Tarly.
3517,"Sam, is that you?!",Yes!
3518,"Are you alright? Shh, you're alright. Yeah, of course you are my brave little fella.",It was horrible.
3519,A hundred thousand you say?,Yes sir.
3520,"Do you know what leadership means, Lord Snow? It means that the person in charge gets second-guessed by every clever little twat with a mouth. But if he starts second-guessing himself, that's the end. For him. For the clever little twats. For everyone. This is not the end. Not for us. Not if you lot do your duty for however long it takes to beat them back. And then you get to go on hating me and I get to go on wishing your Wildling whore had finished the job.",You'll be safe down here. I'll check on you as soon as I can.
3521,You're leaving me again?,I'm not leaving you!
3522,What are you going to do out there?,Help my brothers.
3523,How?! You going to fight the Free Folk when they come? They'll kill you. In Molestown they killed everyone.,I can't just hide here with you while they're fighting out there.
3524,"Why not? You won't matter up there, you will down here.","Look. I am a man of the Night's Watch, Gilly. I made a promise to defend The Wall and I have to keep it, because that's what men do."
3525,I've never thrown a spear before. I've never held a sword with a proper edge. There's no place for me to be. You're not afraid?,"Of course I'm afraid, there's a band of Wildlings coming to kill us."
3526,"Well if you're afraid of a band of Wildlings, how in seven hells did you manage to kill a White Walker?","I didn't know I was going to kill it, but I had to do something I didn't have any choice, he was going to kill Gilly and take the baby. If someone had asked me my name right then, I wouldn't have known. I wasn't Samwell Tarly anymore. I wasn't a Steward in the Night's Watch or son of Randyll Tarly or any of that. I was nothing at all. And when you're nothing at all, there's no more reason to be afraid."
3527,But you're afraid now?,"Yes, well, I'm not nothing anymore."
3528,How high are the walls?,"Well, we'll be up and over before they know what's happened."
3529,I said knock and hold you cunts! Does knock mean draw?!,No Ser!
3530,Does fucking hold mean fucking drop?!,You all plan to die here tonight?
3531,You all plan to die here tonight?,That's very good to hear. Draw!
3532,Now?,Now!
3533,What?!,"What are you fucking waiting for, loose!"
3534,Did you get one?,"No. Ah shit, Pyp. Shit. Sam."
3535,Yeah?,I think we're gonna die.
3536,Brothers! A hundred generations have defended this castle. We've never fallen before. She will not fall tongiht. Those are Things at our walls. They eat the flesh of the men they kill. Do you want to fill the belly of a Thing tonight?,No!
3537,"Those are giants riding mammoths down there. Do you think your cold, rolled steel's gonna stop them?",No such thing as giants. They're stories for the children.
3538,Needed below? Yes. Yes.,Archers! Knock your arrows! Draw! Loose!
3539,How do you know that?,Because I've made that claim.
3540,"Oh, is it over?",Huh?
3541,Huh?,Well then. *hands Pyp a loaded crossbow*
3542,to Olly* Get me to the top! You hear me?!,"Your name's Olly, right? Listen to me Olly, get me to the top and when we give a signal, bring us back down. Do you hear me?"
3543,"Your name's Olly, right? Listen to me Olly, get me to the top and when we give a signal, bring us back down. Do you hear me?","And find a weapon, Olly. Fight them!"
3544,What are you doing up here?,The Wildlings are over the walls. Ser Alliser has fallen. The castle walls can't stand much longer.
3545,"Might as well enjoy our last night, right boys? Light the fuckers up. Knock! Draw! Loose!",How are we gonna stop that?
3546,How are we gonna stop that?,We shot twenty-eight arrows in him already.
3547,"The gods aren't down here. It's the six of us, you hear me?","No, please."
3548,Do you remember that cave?,We shouldo ve stayed in that cave.
3549,"Woah! It's me. It's me. I promised you, didn't I?",We held them off.
3550,"Great victory? Mance was testing our defenses. He almost made it through. And he has more giants, he has more mammoths. He has a thousand times as many men. They'll hit us again tonight. Maybe we can hold them off for a day or two, but we can never beat them.",Where are you going?
3551,Where are you going?,I'm going to find Mance.
3552,"Who's left to give orders? The Wildling army is only an army because of Mance. He united a hundred warring tribes. Without Mance they lose their leader. They lose their purpose, they go back to fighting each other, scatter back to their home.",Without Mance? You're going to kill him?
3553,Without Mance? You're going to kill him?,I'm going to try.
3554,You're right. It's a bad plan. What's your plan?,"They held the gate. Get some brothers down here to help you. You need to burn the bodies. Raise the outer gate, then lower it again as soon as I'm out."
3555,What are you doing?,I promised Jeor I'd never lose it again. *he hands the sword to Sam* In case I don't come back.
3556,"All of your vows? She wasn't enough to turn ya, eh? Were you enough to turn her?",She put three arrows in me when I escaped.
3557,Did you see her again at Castle Black?,Yes.
3558,And?,She's dead.
3559,Your doing?,No.
3560,"Kullback, could I trouble you for something to eat? I don't imagine our guest has eaten anything in quite some time. So. You're here to strike a bargain?",Turn your army around and go home.
3561,You know I know you're low on arrows. You're low on oil. You're low on men. How many are left? 50?,I told Tormund and Orell. We have more than a thousand men.
3562,"I showed you everything I had. The whole army, a hundred thousand strong, and what did you do? You fired on us with everything you had. It wasn't much. Soon as I saw that I sent four hundred men to climb the wall. An unmanned stretch five miles west of here. A lot of them will die climbing, but most of them will be over by the end of the day. This is me being honest with you, Jon Snow, which is more than you've ever done for me. My people have bled enough. We're not here to conquer, we're here to hide behind your wall just like you. We need your tunnel. Now we both know that winter is coming and if my people aren't south of the wall when it comes in earnest, we'll all end up worse than dead. Wanna strike a bargain with me? Here's a bargain. You go back, you open the gates to us and I swear to you that no one else will die. Refuse and we'll kill every last man in Castle Black.","Ah! Oh, that's why you're here. I reckon you could do it before any of them could stop ya. They'd kill you of course, they'd kill ya slow, but ya knew that when you came in here. Are you capable of that, Jon Snow? Killing a man in his own tent when he's just offered ya peace? Is that what the Night's Watch is? Is that what you are?"
3563,"Ah! Oh, that's why you're here. I reckon you could do it before any of them could stop ya. They'd kill you of course, they'd kill ya slow, but ya knew that when you came in here. Are you capable of that, Jon Snow? Killing a man in his own tent when he's just offered ya peace? Is that what the Night's Watch is? Is that what you are?",You attacking us?
3564,You attacking us?,"No, it's like you said, we don't have the men."
3565,You're the king beyond the wall?,You know who I am?
3566,You know who I am?,Never had the pleasure.
3567,What are men of the Night's Watch doing in a Wildling camp?,I was sent to discuss terms with the king beyond the wall.
3568,What do you think he'd have done with him?,"I was this man's prisoner once. He couldo ve tortured me, he couldo ve killed me, but he spared my life. I think my father wouldo ve taken him prisoner, listened to what he had to say."
3569,May I ask what you think you're doing?,Saving him.
3570,You can save him?,"Difficult to say, your grace, but if my past work is any guide. We stand a chance."
3571,Will it weaken him?,Oh no.
3572,Do you think you'll be the first person dragged into a sept to be married against her will?,"When you marched into the throne room to tell me we'd won the Battle at Blackwater, do you remember?! I was sitting on the iron throne with Tommen. I was about to give him essence of nightshade, that's how far I was willing to go when I thought someone awful had come to take my son away. Someone awful is coming to take him away."
3573,"When you marched into the throne room to tell me we'd won the Battle at Blackwater, do you remember?! I was sitting on the iron throne with Tommen. I was about to give him essence of nightshade, that's how far I was willing to go when I thought someone awful had come to take my son away. Someone awful is coming to take him away.",No.
3574,And how will you do that?,I'll tell everyone the truth.
3575,And what truth would that be?,"You don't know, do you? You never believed it. How is that possible? What am I saying, of course it's possible. How can someone so consumed by the idea of his family have any conception what his actual family was doing? We were right there in front of you and you didn't see us. One look in the past twenty years, one real look and you wouldo ve known."
3576,"You don't know, do you? You never believed it. How is that possible? What am I saying, of course it's possible. How can someone so consumed by the idea of his family have any conception what his actual family was doing? We were right there in front of you and you didn't see us. One look in the past twenty years, one real look and you wouldo ve known.",Known what?
3577,Known what?,Everything they say is true. About Jaime and me.
3578,"You won. One fewer brother. Must be proud of yourself. There's really nothing you wouldn't do, is there?","For my family, no. I would do things for my family you couldn't imagine."
3579,Are you really mad enough to blame him for that? He didn't decide to kill her. He was an infant.,"A disease doesn't decide to kill you, all the same you cut it out before it does. What do you decide? What do you choose?"
3580,"A disease doesn't decide to kill you, all the same you cut it out before it does. What do you decide? What do you choose?","The things I did to get back to you, to endure all that, only to find you-"
3581,Told him what?,I told him about us.
3582,You told him?,"I told him I wouldn't marry Loras Tyrell. I told him I'm staying right here with Tommen, with you."
3583,You think he'll just accept that?,Go and ask him.
3584,What did you say?,"I don't want to talk about Tywin Lannister. I don't choose Tywin Lannister, I don't love Tywin Lannister. I love my brother. I love my lover. People will whisper, they'll make their jokes. Let them. They're all so small I can't even see them. I only see what matters."
3585,I hope I can prove worthy of her admiration. What can I do for you?,"When you took the city, the children begged me not to leave the house. But Master Mighdal and I agreed that I must. So I lost my home. Now I live on the streets."
3586,"Even if they are safe, who would I be there? What purpose would I serve? With my master, I was a teacher. I had the respect and love of these children.",What is it that you want from me?
3587,What is it that you want from me?,"Your grace, I ask you to let me sell myself back to Master Mighdal."
3588,"You want to return to a man who owned you, like a goat or a chair?","Please, your grace, the young may rejoice in the new world you've built for them. But for those of us too old to change there is only fear and squalor. I am not alone. There are many outside waiting to beg the same-"
3589,What was her name?,"Zala, your grace."
3590,How old was she?,Three.
3591,Three. *in Valyrian* And still no word on Drogon?,"in Valyrian* Sailors saw him flying over the Black Cliffs three days ago, my queen. Nothing since then."
3592,Your old blind man patched me up. Why?,"He's sworn to treat all wounded men, friend or foe."
3593,You want me alive so you can torture me?,No one's going to torture you.
3594,So how do we die? Hanging? Beheading? Drop us from the top of the wall?,I don't know what happens to the prisoners.
3595,Who decides?,I suppose Stannis does.
3596,He your king now?,I don't have a king.
3597,We're gonna burn the bodies of your dead. Do you want to say any words over them?,Words? What kind of words?
3598,Words? What kind of words?,Funeral words. I don't know how the Free Folk do it.
3599,Do what?,Say farewell.
3600,Snow. Did you love her? She loved you.,She told you?
3601,She told you?,No. All she ever talked about was killing you. That's how I know. She belongs in the North. The real North. You understand me?
3602,No. All she ever talked about was killing you. That's how I know. She belongs in the North. The real North. You understand me?,"We can stop, we can rest."
3603,Who are you?,"The First Men called us The Children, but we were born long before them. Come, he waits for you."
3604,How do you know?,"I've been watching you. All of you, all of your lives, with a thousand eyes and one. Now you've come to me at last, Brandon Stark, though the hour is late."
3605,You're going to help me walk again?,You'll never walk again. But you will fly.
3606,Podrick. Podrick! Where are the horses?,I hobbled them last night.
3607,What sort of hobble?,"A figure-eight, like you taught me."
3608,"Thieves, maybe?",It's at least thirty miles to the Eyrie from here. You're carrying the saddle bags.
3609,I like your sword. Are we getting close to the bloody gate?,About ten more miles.
3610,Did you hear that Podrick? Only about ten more miles to the Bloody Gate.,Are you a knight?
3611,Are you a knight?,No.
3612,Does it have a name?,Oathkeeper.”
3613,Who taught you how to fight?,My father.
3614,You want something?,That's Sandor Clegane- the Hound.
3615,Why didn't you?,She commanded me to bring Jaime Lannister back to King's Landing.
3616,"No? Fancy sword you've got there. Where'd you get it? I've been looking at Lannister gold all my life. Go on, Brienne of fucking Tarth, tell me that's not Lannister gold.",Jaime Lannister gave me this sword.
3617,"Safety?! Where the fuck's that? Her aunt in the Eyrie's dead. Her mother's dead, her father's dead, her brother's dead. Winterfell's a pile of rubble. There's no safety, you dumb bitch. If you don't know that by now, you're the wrong one to watch over her.",And that's what you're doing? Watching over her?
3618,And that's what you're doing? Watching over her?,"Aye, that's what I'm doing."
3619,Arya! Arya! ARYA! Where is she?,She was just here...
3620,Why weren't you watching her?,I was watching you I thought you migth need some help…
3621,Which way Pod? Which way did she go?,"Ah, I think that way."
3622,You're still here? [Coughs] Big bitch saved you.,I don't need saving.
3623,You're gonna die?,"Unless there's a Maester hiding behind that rock, aye, I'm done. I'd skin you alive for wine. [Arya offers water.] Fuck water! Killed by a woman. I bet you liked that. Go on, go after her. She'll help you. Going out alone, you won't last a day out there."
3624,"You remember where the heart is? Fuck it. I'm ready. Go on, girl. Another name off your list. You kept promising me. I cut down your butcher's boy, the ginger. He was begging for mercy. Please sir, please don't kill me, please, please. Bled all over my horse. Saddle stunk of butcher's boy for weeks. And your sister, your pretty sister. I shouldo ve taken her. That night the Blackwater burned, I shouldo ve fucked her bloody. At least I'd have one happy memory! Do I have to beg you? Do it. Do it.",Kill me. Kill me! Kill me! Kill me!
3625,Is that any way to speak about our mother?,What're you doing?

3627,What do you think I'm doing? The galley's waiting in the bay bound for the Free Cities.,Who's helping you?
3628,Who's helping you?,Varys.
3629,Varys?,You have more friends than you thought.
3630,"Tyrion! Put down the crossbow. Who released you? Ah, your brother ,I expect. He always had a soft spot for you. Come, we'll go and talk in my chambers. Is this how you want to speak to me? Shaming your father has always given you pleasure…","All my life, you've wanted me dead."
3631,"Yes. But you refused to die. I respect that, even admire it. You fight for what's yours. I'd never let them execute you; is that what you fear? I'd never let Illyn Payne take your head. You're a Lannister. You're my son.",I loved her.
3632,Who?,Shae.
3633,It doesn't matter?,She was a whore!
3634,And what? You'll kill your own father in the privy? No. You're my son. Enough of this nonsense…,"I am your son, and you sentenced me to die. You knew I didn't poison Joffrey, but you sentenced me all the same. Why?"
3635,"I am your son, and you sentenced me to die. You knew I didn't poison Joffrey, but you sentenced me all the same. Why?",Enough. We'll go back to my chambers and speak with some dignity.
3636,"What, are you afraid of a dead whore?",You shot me. You're no son of mine.
3637,"What have you done? Quickly. Trust me, my friend, I've brought you this far.",I want to see the captain.
3638,Where's home?,The Free City of Braavos.
3639,Why not?,If your father hears…
3640,Are you sure?,Yes.
3641,I've been promised to the prince. When will we marry?,You'll never wed the prince. You'll wed the king.
3642,But I will be queen?,"Oh yes, you'll be queen. For a time. In comes another. Younger, more beautiful, to cast you down and take all you hold dear."
3643,Will the king and I have children?,"No. The king will have 20 children, and you will have 3."
3644,They?,All of them out there are enemies. They're waiting a night to make sure he's really dead and as soon as they see the stones on his eyes they'll set to work on tearing us apart.
3645,and now our father is dead. And that little monster is out there somewhere drawing breath. Did you set him free?,"Tyrion may be a monster but at least he killed our father on purpose. You killed him by mistake. With stupidity. You're a man of action, aren't you? When it occurs to you to do something you do it, nevermind the consequences. Take a look. Look at the consequences. Here they are. He loved you more than anyone in this world."
3646,"Tyrion may be a monster but at least he killed our father on purpose. You killed him by mistake. With stupidity. You're a man of action, aren't you? When it occurs to you to do something you do it, nevermind the consequences. Take a look. Look at the consequences. Here they are. He loved you more than anyone in this world.",Apologies.
3647,Do you know what it's like to stuff your shit through one of those air holes?,No. I only know what it's like to pick up your shit and throw it overboard.
3648,Pentos?,"The home of my colleague. Ilyrio Mopatis. A merchant. He and I met many years ago, through mutual friends. A group of people who saw Robert Baratheon for the disaster he was. We tried to do what was best for the realm by supporting the Targaryen restoration. And thus began the chain of mistakes that has led us both here. Things have gotten worse, not better. Westeros needs to be saved from itself."
3649,My lord?,I don't think I am anymore. A lord. Are you a lord if you kill your father? I don't suppose they revoke your nobility for killing a whore. That has to be happen all the time.
3650,I don't think I am anymore. A lord. Are you a lord if you kill your father? I don't suppose they revoke your nobility for killing a whore. That has to be happen all the time.,You already drank yourself across the Narrow Sea.
3651,In a box. Why stop now?,Because we are talking about the future of our country.
3652,You want the same? Same as always?,You… you don't have to.
3653,Sons of the Harpy?,"Yes, your grace. They left it on the body."
3654,"Then they will have to learn to see things differently, Mossador. He did not risk his life fighting for freedom so cowards in masks could take it away. And I did not take up residence in this pyramid so I could watch the city below decline into chaos. What was the name of the man you lost?","White Rat, your grace."
3655,Why do you come?,"White Rat, the Unsullied who… I have heard they found his body in a brothel. I have heard that more than one Unsullied has been known to visit Meereen's brothels. May I ask you why? Why would an Unsullied go to a brothel?"
3656,"White Rat, the Unsullied who… I have heard they found his body in a brothel. I have heard that more than one Unsullied has been known to visit Meereen's brothels. May I ask you why? Why would an Unsullied go to a brothel?",I do not know. I must go.
3657,"Shouldn't you be training, too?","Well, I'm hardly a new recruit. How many brothers can say they've killed a white walker and a Thenn? I might be the first in history!"
3658,"Well, I'm hardly a new recruit. How many brothers can say they've killed a white walker and a Thenn? I might be the first in history!",These men need a firm hand. Always have. They're poachers and thieves.
3659,"You're not cold, my lady?","Never. The Lordo s fire lives within me, Jon Snow."
3660,Are you a virgin?,No.
3661,You know who rules at Winterfell now?,Roose Bolton.
3662,The traitor who plunged a dagger into Robb Stark's heart. Don't you want to avenge him?,"I want a great many things, your grace. But I'm a sworn brother of the Night's Watch now."
3663,Many don't. You were seen taking the body of a wildling girl north of the Wall. Why?,It's where she belonged.
3664,"Your grace, you want the wildlings to march in your army?","If they swear to follow me, I'll pardon them. We'll take Winterfell. Once the North is won, I'll declare them citizens of the realm. I'll give them land to live on."
3665,"You admire him, don't you?",I respect him.
3666,How much time do I have?,"Nightfall. The sun drops fast this time of year. Hurry, Jon Snow."
3667,Great warrior? He sings a sword like a girl with palsy.,My lord.
3668,Does he?,The gift of a great name. Sometimes that's all one needs.
3669,"Will we head north at some point? He said Sansa had a brother at Castle Black. We're a few days ride from the Kingsroad, but that will take us--",Us? The only reason you're here is that Jaime Lannister told me you weren't safe in the capital. You're hundreds of miles from King's Landing. No one knows what you look like. No one cares. You're safe.
3670,Us? The only reason you're here is that Jaime Lannister told me you weren't safe in the capital. You're hundreds of miles from King's Landing. No one knows what you look like. No one cares. You're safe.,But I'm you're squire.
3671,Do you even know what a squire is?,An attendant to a knight?
3672,An attendant to a knight?,I'm not a knight. That means you're not a squire.
3673,"Well, where would I go?","I don't care, I'm not your mother."
3674,Will you shut your mouth? I didn't ask for advice. I don't want anyone following me. I'm not a leader. All I ever wanted is to fight for a Lord I believed in. The good lords are dead and the rest are monsters.,You told Lord Royce we were going to the Fingers.
3675,"Lord Royce may be as honorable as he thinks he is, but he's not alone in that castle. Do you trust all those knights and ladies, stable boys and serving girls?",No. Do you trust the carriage driver or the knights escorting us?
3676,No. Do you trust the carriage driver or the knights escorting us?,"No. But I pay them well, and they've seen what happens to men who disappoint me."
3677,So where are we going? To a land where you trust everyone?,"So a land so far from here, even Cersei Lannister can't get her hands on you."
3678,What can I do for you?,You can forgive me.
3679,What could you possibly have done to warrant my forgiveness?,I led you into the darkness.
3680,It does. That's the Sunspear bit right there. And that's where the mountains are. And over here is… Sunsnake? Stonespear?,Sandstone.
3681,What's your name?,"Olyvar, my lady."
3682,Perhaps you might consider being a bit more discreet?,Why? They all know about me anyway. Everybody knows everything about everyone. What's the point in trying to keep a secret in a place like this?
3683,Why? They all know about me anyway. Everybody knows everything about everyone. What's the point in trying to keep a secret in a place like this?,In any event… you shouldn't keep your intended waiting.
3684,My intended? Please. Tywin's dead. That means no one can force Cersei to marry me.,Lucky you.
3685,You think I want that woman married to my brother?,"If she doesn't marry me, she doesn't go to Highgarden. Which means she stays in King's Landing. Which means you're trapped here with Cersei Lannister as your mother-by-law."
3686,Perhaps?,Perhaps?
3687,Perhaps?,"Eunuch, the spider, the master of whisperers."
3688,Refuse the Kingslayer? A dangerous proposition.,"Not as dangerous as releasing me. You risked your life, your position, everything. Why? You're not family, you owe me nothing."
3689,"Not as dangerous as releasing me. You risked your life, your position, everything. Why? You're not family, you owe me nothing.",I didn't do it for you. I did it for the Seven Kingdoms.
3690,Compassion? Yes. I killed my lover with my bare hands. I shot my own father with a crossbow.,I never said you were perfect.
3691,What is it you want exactly?,Peace. Prosperity. A land where the powerful do not prey on the powerless.
3692,"Perhaps. And perhaps we've grown so used to horror we assume there's no other way. If you sat on the Iron Throne, would you spread misery throughout the land?",I will never sit on the Iron Throne.
3693,"Who said anything about him? You have a choice my friend. You can stay here at Ilyrio's palace and drink yourself to death, or you can ride with me to Mereen, meet Daenerys Targaryen, and decide if the world is worth fighting for.",Can I drink myself to death on the road to Meereen?
3694,Can I drink myself to death on the road to Meereen?,When did the Unsullied start patrolling the streets of Meereen? Looks like your friends haven't been behaving themselves.
3695,When did the Unsullied start patrolling the streets of Meereen? Looks like your friends haven't been behaving themselves.,"The mission to Yunkai was a resounding success. The Wise Masters of Yunkai have agreed to cede power to a council of elders, made up of both the freedmen and the former slaveholders. All matters of consequence will be brought to you for review."
3696,Concessions?,"Politics is the art of compromise, your grace."
3697,The fighting pits? Where slaves fought slaves to the death?,"In the new world that you've brought to us, free men would fight free men."
3698,How many times must I say no before you understand?,Whatever he wants from me he's not going to get it. If he really believes I'm going to reopen the fighting pits…
3699,What?,"My mother was a whore, I told you that. She liked to drink pear brandy. The older she got, the less she made selling her body, the more she wanted to drink. So one day when I was 12, she sold me to a slaver she fucked the night before."
3700,Why?,"I was a bad child. I wasn't big, but I was quick. And I loved to fight. So they sold me to a man in Tolos who trained fighters for the pits. I had my first match when I was 16."
3701,"You were sold into slavery, forced to fight to the death for the amusement of the masters, and you're defending the fighting pits?","I'm only here because of those pits. I learned to fight like a Dothraki screamer, a Norvoshi priest, a Westerosi knight. Soon I was famous. 10,000 men and women screamed my name when I stepped into the pit. I made so much money for my master he set me free when I died. I joined the Second Sons, and then I met you."
3702,Viserion? Rhaegal?,Easy. Easy. Easy.
3703,You know what Stannis wants?,He wants me to bend the knee. And he wants the free folk to fight for him. I'll give him this much
3704,Shouldn't a king be bold?,"Oh, aye. I respect him. If he gets what he wants, I expect he'll be a better ruler than the fools sitting on the Iron Throne the last hundred years. But I'll never serve him."
3705,"You spent your life convincing 90 clans to come together for the first time in history. Thenns and Hornfoots, the ice-river clans, even the giants. A life's work uniting them. You didn't do it for power. You didn't do it for glory. You brought them together to save them because none of them will survive the winter, not if they're north of the wall. Isn't their survival more important than your pride?",Pride? Fuck my pride. This isn't about that.
3706,Pride? Fuck my pride. This isn't about that.,Then bend the knee and save your people.
3707,And how many tens of thousands are out there right now? How many women? How many children? And you won't go out and rescue them because why? You're afraid of looking afraid.,"Oh, I am afraid. No shame in that. How will they do it? Beheading? Hanging?"
3708,"Oh, I am afraid. No shame in that. How will they do it? Beheading? Hanging?",They'll burn you alive.
3709,"And what happens to your people? You preserve your dignity and die standing, and they'll sing songs about you. “You'd rather burn than kneel. The great hero.” Until winter comes, and the white walkers come for us all, and there's no one left to sing.","You're a good lad. Truly, you are. But if you can't understand why I won't enlist my people in a foreigner's war, there's no point explaining."
3710,Ale? Ale?,"Before we left, a maester gave you a raven scroll."
3711,So it was good news.?,My marriage proposal has been accepted.
3712,Ale?,I'll have some.
3713,What is it?,Sansa Stark. Don't look!
3714,You sure?,"She's dyed her hair, but it's her. She's sitting with Petyr Baelish."
3715,Littlefinger?,A bunch of knights with him.
3716,Bunch? What's a bunch? 100? 6? 20?,"10, I think. Too many. My lady, I don't think this is the right--"
3717,Do you like the taste?,I don't see what all the fuss is about. Why do men love it so much?
3718,I don't see what all the fuss is about. Why do men love it so much?,It gives some men courage.
3719,Does it give you courage?,That's far enough.
3720,"We've met. With Renly Baratheon. What did he say about you? He said, ""You're a loyalty comes free of charge."" Someone appears to have paid quite a bit for it since then.","Lady Sansa, before your mother's death, I was her sworn sword. I gave my word I would find you and protect you. I will shield your back and keep your council, and give my life for yours if need be. I swear it by the old gods and the new."
3721,"Please, Lady Brienne. No need for such formality. You are Catelyn Stark's sworn sword?",I was.
3722,Then what did happen?,He was murdered by a shadow. A shadow with a face of Stannis Baratheon.
3723,A shadow? With a face? This woman swore to protect Renly; she failed. She swore to protect your mother; she failed. Why would I want somebody with your history of failure guiding Lady Sansa?,Why should you have any say in her affairs?
3724,Why should you have any say in her affairs?,"Because I am her uncle. I married her Aunt Lysa shortly before my belovedo s untimely death. We're family now, and you're an outsider. Forgive me, Lady Brienne, but experiences made me wary of outsiders."
3725,We don't want our new friend wandering the countryside alone. The roads of these parts aren't safe. Why don't you stay?,He asked you to stay.
3726,Podrick?,"Yes, my lady?"
3727,"Yes, my lady?",You can stand now.
3728,"Yes, my lady. Sansa Stark?","Wary of strangers, as she should me. I saw her riding on the East Trail with Littlefinger. We'll follow them."
3729,Do you think she's safe from Littlefinger?,"No, my lady."
3730,What?,Not so loud.
3731,And what has your caution brought? Our eldest child murdered at his own wedding. Our only daughter shipped off to Dorne. Our baby boy sent to marry that smirking whore from Highgarden.,I'll make things better.
3732,No army. Do you know where they're keeping her?,Oberyn mentioned the Water Gardens.
3733,"I'll find her. Is there anything else, your grace?",You're going to Dorne? A one-handed man? Alone?
3734,You're going to Dorne? A one-handed man? Alone?,I never said I was going alone.
3735,"No sunflowers. I don't like yellow. Roses are very nice, definitely roses. And music. I adore music. But no flutes, I hate flutes! We can have a harp if you like, but no flutes. Then there's the food. Food is the most important thing, don't you agree? We're going to need pigeon pies. That's what they eat in the capital, don't they?",Don't they?
3736,Don't they?,Don't who?
3737,Don't who?,People eat pigeon pie in the capital.
3738,"It's a fine place, isn't it? A fine place. I never thought I'd end up settling down in a place like this.",You won't.
3739,Pardon?,"We won't get to live at Stokeworth. When Mother dies, my sister gets the castle because she's older."
3740,You know what I think? I think you're a good person. And your sister is a mean person.,She is.
3741,Who's that?,Jaime fucking Lannister.
3742,Beautiful bride you've chosen. When were you planning on getting married?,Just get on with it.
3743,On with what?,What you're here for. There's no way this little visit could possibly mean anything good for me.
3744,How is this good for me?,"Cause you're going to come with me and help me with something important. And when we return, I'm going to give you a much better girl, and a much better castle."
3745,Return from where?,As far south as south goes.
3746,You would have me go to war?,You would have me go to war?
3747,You would have me go to war?,The whole country would have you go to war.
3748,"Oberyn is dead. And this Lannister girl skips about the Water Gardens eating our food, breathing our air. How many of your brothers and sisters do they have to kill?",I loved my brother. And you made him very happy. For that you will always have a place in my heart. But we do not mutilate little girls for vengeance. Not here. Not while I rule.
3749,And how long will that be?,The Unsullied are too conspicuous.
3750,"Anyone can see you coming from a mile off. Of course you haven't found any Sons of the Harpy. You haven't, have you?","My Second Sons, on the other hand, they drink, they whore, fight in the streets--they blend in. They overhear things in taverns, follow people from the taverns to nice, quiet alleys, break a few fingers, overhear a few more things. Before you know it..."
3751,In a hurry? You're afraid?,Unsullied fear nothing.
3752,Why?,"For one thing, he may have valuable information."
3753,How do you know that?,Because I questioned him.
3754,Why should he want to bring back slavery? What did it do for him?,Perhaps the only thing that gave him pride was knowing that there was someone lower than he was.
3755,And how do you know this?,Everyone knows this.
3756,About what?,About your father. About the Mad King.
3757,The Mad King? You're here to remind me of my enemies' lies? Consider me reminded.,"Your Grace, I served in his Kingsguard. I was at his side from the first. Your enemies did not lie."
3758,"When I agreed to come with you, did I misrepresent my intentions? Besides, what is there for me to do inside this fucking box?",You don't like it?
3759,You don't like it?,I want to take a walk.
3760,Are we really going to spend the entire road to Volantis talking about the futility of everything?,You're right. No point. The road to Volantis? You said we were going to Meereen. What's in Volantis?
3761,You're right. No point. The road to Volantis? You said we were going to Meereen. What's in Volantis?,The road to Meereen.
3762,And what do you hope to find at the end of the road to Meereen?,I told you. A ruler.
3763,Why?,Cause I liked it. Power. Even as a servant.
3764,How many dwarves are there in the world? Is Cersei going to kill them all?,Not him.
3765,"Are you trying to deceive your Queen? Shall I throw them in a cell, Your Grace?","That won't be necessary, Ser Meryn. I don't want to dissuade the other hunters. Mistakes will be made."
3766,You're the Hand of the King?,"No, Uncle. Clearly it would not be appropriate for a woman to assume that role. I'm merely advising my son until he comes of age and chooses a Hand for himself."
3767,"Your Grace, him? This man? This embarrassment to the Citadel? Your Grace, what qualifications can he possibly have for this post?","The qualification of loyalty, Grand Maester. That's far more than the eunuch ever had. Far more than many ever have."
3768,What mission?,That is not your concern as Master of War.
3769,You would abandon your king in his time of need?,"If he wants to send for me, I will be waiting for him. At Casterly Rock."
3770,"Hmm! Did you know that the youngest Lord Commander in history, Osric Stark, was elected at the age of 10?","I know ""S""."
3771,How old were you when you learned to read?,Three.
3772,"Three?! Who taught you, your mother?",No. Old Maester Cressen did. I had a lot of time to practice. My mother kept me inside because...
3773,"What do you call it in the South, what happened to your face?",Greyscale. What do you call it north of the Wall?
3774,Greyscale. What do you call it north of the Wall?,I don't know. But two of my sisters had it. They both died. How did they cure you?
3775,I don't know. But two of my sisters had it. They both died. How did they cure you?,"I don't remember. I was a baby. Lots of people came and tried, I think. Whatever they did, it went away. What happened to your sisters?"
3776,"I don't remember. I was a baby. Lots of people came and tried, I think. Whatever they did, it went away. What happened to your sisters?",My father made them move out of the keep into the huts outside. None of us were allowed to go near them. But we heard them. Especially at night. They started to sound... not like themselves.
3777,Did you ever see them?,"Only once at the end. They were covered with it. Their faces, their arms. They acted like animals. My father had to drag them out to the woods on a rope."
3778,What did he do to them in the woods?,Mother.
3779,Why?,She's a wildling.
3780,Who then? You?,No. Only one of their own.
3781,Do you know this wretched girl Lyanna Mormont?,The Lord Commander's niece.
3782,That amuses you?,"I apologize, Your Grace. Northerners can be a bit like the free folk. Loyal to their own."
3783,Unpleasant man. He thinks you're a traitor. What's your life going to be like on the Wall with Thorne in command?,"Unpleasant, I expect."
3784,He'll make you a Stark with the stroke of a pen?,"It's the first thing I ever remember wanting. I'd daydream that my father would ask the king, and just like that I would never be the bastard of Winterfell again."
3785,"I swore a vow to the Night's Watch. If I don't take my own word seriously, what sort of Lord of Winterfell would I be?",Crowded. You'd think we were serving venison stew.
3786,Does anyone wish to speak for candidates before we cast our tokens for the 998th Lord Commander of the Night's Watch?,"Ser Alliser Thorne is not just a knight, he's a man of true nobility. He was acting commander when the Wall came under attack, and led us to victory against the wildlings."
3787,Is there anyone else?,"Ser Denys Mallister joined the Watch as a boy and has served loyally longer than any other ranger. Through 10 winters he served. As commander of the Shadow Tower, he kept the wildlings away. We could do no better."
3788,Another wildling lover just like his friend Jon Snow. How's your lady love Slayer?,Her name is Gilly. Brother Slynt knows her quite well. They cowered together in the larder during the battle for the Wall.
3789,"I can't argue with any of that. But who does Jon Snow want to command? Night's Watch or the wildlings? Everyone knows he loved a wildling girl and spoke with Mance Rayder many times. What would have happened in that tent between those two old friends if Stannis's army hadn't come along? We all saw him put the King-beyond-the-Wall out of his misery. Do you want to choose a man who has fought the wildlings all his life, or a man who makes love to them?",It is time.
3790,What have you got there?,I said--
3791,Who are you? Why were they scared of you?,You lost this.
3792,Well who are you then?,No one. And that is who a girl must become.
3793,"Then who lives in the Pyramids? Who wears gold masks and murders your children? When Grey Worm came to us, I was the first to take up the knife for you. I remember the look on my father's face as I struck down his Master, who had traded his infant son for a dog. My father died in the fighting. If we allow the Sons of the Harpy to return us to chains, he never lived.","The Harpy's life was not yours to take. Once, the Masters were the law--"
3794,"No? Why come, then?",You said that I could be your apprentice. You said you'd teach me how to a Faceless Man.
3795,Which one is the Many-Faced God? I see the Stranger. I see the Drowned God. I see the Weirwood Face.,There is only one god. A girl knows his name. And all men know his gift.
3796,Where are they taking him?,Queen Margaery! Queen Margaery! Queen Margaery!
3797,Did I hurt you?,No. You were lovely.
3798,"Wouldn't that be glorious? . Shouldn't we rest a little while? Just to catch our breath, there's no rush, is there?",Of course not. Are you hungry? Shall I have them bring you some cake or pomegranate juice?
3799,Of course not. Are you hungry? Shall I have them bring you some cake or pomegranate juice?,"No, I'm fine. I just want you all to myself. I want to know everything there is to know about King Tommen First of His Name."
3800,King Tommen. It still sounds strange to me. Does Queen Margaery sound strange to you?,So strange… Husband.
3801,"I understand. But it's not your fault, you know that, don't you? You mustn't feel guilty.",I don't feel guilty. That's what's odd.
3802,Do you like to sail?,I love to sail.
3803,"Living in a tower so high, it touches the clouds. Of course my grandmother couldn't wait to go home. The capital is not for everyone, I suppose. Does your mother like it here?",I don't think so. She told me never to trust anyone in King's Landing.
3804,"You look very much in love. The first days of marriage are often so blissful. She's certainly very pretty, isn't she? Like a doll, she smiles quite a lot. Do you think she's intelligent? I can't quite tell. Not that it matters.",Do you ever miss Casterly Rock?
3805,Do you ever miss Casterly Rock?,There's nothing for me in Casterly Rock.
3806,Why are we speaking of Casterly Rock?,"The way that you talked about it, I always thought that you missed it. That you... That it was your real home."
3807,But wouldn't you be happier in Casterly Rock?,"I said, ""Darling, surely 4 times is enough, are you trying to set a new record?"" . And he said, ""Well, what is the record? I'm sure we can break it."""
3808,"I said, ""Darling, surely 4 times is enough, are you trying to set a new record?"" . And he said, ""Well, what is the record? I'm sure we can break it.""",Mother! . Welcome.
3809,Can we bring you anything to eat or drink? I wish we had some wine for you. It's a bit early in the day for us.,"No, no. I, I can't stay. I just wanted to let you know if, there is ever anything I can do for you."
3810,"Oh, forgive me, I haven't been at Court for long, I get so confused. What's the proper way to address you now? Queen Mother or Dowager Queen?",There's no need for such formalities.
3811,Can you imagine the celebrations? They'll ring the bells all day and night.,Remember. Anything you need.
3812,And?,The new Lord Cerwyn paid his taxes.
3813,We don't have enough men to hold the North if the other Houses rise up against us. Do you understand that?,Our pact with the Lannisters protects -
3814,"Yes. A bit shabby, isn't it? You've been here before.","On our way down to King's Landing, with my father and Arya and… where are you taking me?"
3815,"On our way down to King's Landing, with my father and Arya and… where are you taking me?",Home.
3816,"The Boltons have Winterfell. . The marriage proposal, it wasn't for you?",No.
3817,"I won't force you to do anything. Don't you know by now how much I care for you? Say the word and we turn the horses round, but listen to me. Listen. . You've been running all your life. Terrible things happened to your family and you weep. You sit alone in a darkened room, mourning their fates. You've been a bystander to tragedy from the day they executed your father. Stop being a bystander, do you hear me? Stop running. There's no justice in the world. Not unless we make it. You loved your family. Avenge them.",How do we get through there?
3818,How do we get through there?,We don't. We go around. .
3819,Aren't you getting a bit old to be a squire? How did you end up squiring for the Imp?,He hates that nickname.
3820,"Well, he's not here to complain about it, is he?","I squired for a knight name Ser Lorimer during the War of the Five Kings. One night, he had a bit too much to drink. And he was famished, so he borrowed a ham."
3821,He borrowed it?,"He wasn't a thief. He was drunk and hungry and he wasn't thinking. I was drunk too. He gave me half the ham. Next morning, one of the guards saw him passed out, under a wagon, with the ham bone still in his hand. They hanged the man afternoon. They tied the noose for me too, but, Lord Tywin heard my family name was Payne. So he pardoned me, and sent me to King's Landing to squire for his son."
3822,"You want to be a knight, Pod?",Yes.
3823,"You weren't a knight, but you were a Kingsguard to Renly Baratheon, weren't you?",I was.
3824,But how did you end up serving Renly?,"When I was a girl, my father held a ball. I'm his only living child, so he wants to make a good match for me. He invited dozens of young lords to Tarth. I didn't want to go, but he dragged me to the ballroom. . And it was wonderful. None of the boys noticed how mulish and tall I was. The shoved each other, and threatened to duel if they thought it was their turn to dance. And whispered in my ear how they wanted to marry me and take me back to their castles. . My father smiled at me and I smiled at him. I'd never been so happy. . Till I saw a few of the boys sniggering. And then they all started to laugh, they couldn't keep the game going any longer. They were toying with me. ‘Brienne the Beauty', they called me. Great joke. And I realized I was the ugliest girl alive. A great lumbering beast. I tried to run away, but Renly Baratheon took me in his arms. “Don't let them see your tears,” he told me. “They're nasty little shits. The nasty little shits aren't worth crying over.” He danced with me and none of the other boys could say a word. And he was the king's brother after all."
3825,But you said a shadow murdered him. How do you fight a shadow?,"A shadow with the face of Stannis Baratheon. I know it was Stannis. I know it in my heart. Stannis is a man, not a shadow. And a man can be killed."
3826,Very well. . Have you considered my offer?,I have. And I thank you for it. You do me great honor. All my life I wanted to be Jon Stark.
3827,"May I ask, Your Grace, how long you plan to stay at Castle Black?",Are you bored of us already?
3828,Are you bored of us already?,You saved us from Mance Rayder's army. We will never forget that. But it's a question of survival. The Night's Watch can't continue to feed your men and the wildling prisoners indefinitely. Winter is coming.
3829,And the wildlings?,"They'd rather burn than fight for me, so be it. I leave their fate to you. You could execute them, that's the safest course. . Or you could see if this Tormund fellow is more willing to compromise than Mance ever was. I assume the brothers of the Night's Watch would rather see the wildlings dead."
3830,You have many enemies in Castle Black. Have you considered sending Alliser Thorne elsewhere? Give him command of Eastwatch-by-the-Sea.,I heard it was best to keep your enemies close.
3831,Have you now? . How does the Night's Watch vow go again? I bet you've got it memorized since you got here.,Night gathers and now my watch begins -
3832,And what needs to be done?,"As long as the Boltons rule the North, , the North will suffer. Just one man's opinion."
3833,What do you want?,Who are you?
3834,Who are you?,What?
3835,What?,"You, who walk in here with a coin you never earned, whose value you do not respect. . Who are you?"
3836,"You, who walk in here with a coin you never earned, whose value you do not respect. . Who are you?",No one.
3837,"A lie, a sad little lie. Who are you?","I told you, I'm no - . Do that again and -"
3838,What are you doing?,We were only playing. The game of faces.
3839,For what? For whatever you want. To be a Faceless Man. To be no one.,"Whose sword is that? It belongs to Arya Stark. Arya Stark's sword, Arya Stark's clothes, Arya Stark's stolen silver. A man wonders how is it that no one came to be surrounded by Arya Stark's things?"
3840,"Whose sword is that? It belongs to Arya Stark. Arya Stark's sword, Arya Stark's clothes, Arya Stark's stolen silver. A man wonders how is it that no one came to be surrounded by Arya Stark's things?",What do we do with them after we wash them?
3841,What do we do with them after we wash them?,Open gates!
3842,"May I introduce my son, , Ramsay Bolton?","It's an honor to meet you, my Lady."
3843,Sam. . Maester Aemon?,He apologizes for not being here. He's not feeling well.
3844,"I will not go meekly off to freeze and die! Give it to one of the fools who cast a stone for you. I will not have it. Do you hear me, boy? I will not have it!",Are you refusing to obey my order?
3845,Are you refusing to obey my order?,You can stick your order up your bastard arse.
3846,Which of the Seven will you worship today?,The Maiden.
3847,Where is the Maiden?,And the Stranger.
3848,"Two is extra, you realize?","Yes, yes."
3849,What are you doing? This establishment belong to Lord Petyr Baelish. You can't -,You have profaned our faith. The faith of our fathers and forefathers.
3850,You were assaulted?,"I was, by those fanatics who call themselves ‘sparrows'. They humiliated me, they they beat me, they left me naked and bleeding on the cobblestones. I am lucky to be alive."
3851,So you were administering to the needs of these devout prostitutes?,A man's private affairs ought to stay private!
3852,"What do you want from us, High Septon?","Justice! I ask that you protect our Faith by arresting these criminals and throwing them in the black cells. I ask that you execute their leader, this so-called High Sparrow. He's a threat to everything we hold sacred. If he goes unpunished -"
3853,And where do I find this man? This High Sparrow?,"I don't think this is a good idea, Your Grace."
3854,"Nonsense, Ser Meryn. These are deeply religious people. . Where can I find the High Sparrow?",Seven blessings.
3855,A young man said I would find the High Sparrow back here. Where is he?,"High Sparrow? Sounds ridiculous, doesn't it? Like Lord Duckling, or King Turtle. . So, it's meant to. We're often stuck with the names our enemies give to us. . The notion that we are all equal in the eyes of Seven doesn't sit well with some, so they belittle me."
3856,"High Sparrow? Sounds ridiculous, doesn't it? Like Lord Duckling, or King Turtle. . So, it's meant to. We're often stuck with the names our enemies give to us. . The notion that we are all equal in the eyes of Seven doesn't sit well with some, so they belittle me.",Seven blessings to you.
3857,Why no shoes?,Because I gave them away to someone who needed them more. We all do that. It stops us from forgetting what we really are.
3858,Is that why you came to King's Landing? To remind everyone?,"Everyone? I have a hard enough job reminding myself. Oh, I tell them no one's special. And they think I'm special for telling them so."
3859,"Everyone? I have a hard enough job reminding myself. Oh, I tell them no one's special. And they think I'm special for telling them so.",Perhaps they're right.
3860,"It would be comforting to believe that, wouldn't it? The Gods sent you here to tempt me? I hope not. I had assumed you'd only come here to arrest me. For that incident with the High Septon.","An unacceptable way to treat the chosen representative of the Gods in this world, wouldn't you say?"
3861,"An unacceptable way to treat the chosen representative of the Gods in this world, wouldn't you say?","Hypocrisy is a boil. Lancing a is never pleasant. Although, they could have been more careful with the blade."
3862,How's your work coming along?,Very well.
3863,You've made progress?,"More than I've expected. Still a way to go, but…"
3864,Shouldn't he be?,"I assure you she's still a virgin. Tyrion never consummated the marriage. By the law of the land, she's no man's wife. Inspect her, if you must."
3865,"I'm sure you understand my position, Lord Baelish. If you received word in the night from the Queen Mother, it does make me question our new alliance. The Lannisters made you one of the great lords of Westeros. Yet, here you are in the North, undermining them. Why gamble with your position?",Every ambitious move is a gamble. You gambled when you drove a dagger into Robb Stark's heart. It appears that your gamble paid off. You're Warden of the North.
3866,I had Tywin Lannister backing. Who supports me now? You?,"The Eyrie is mine. The last time the lords of the Eyrie formed an alliance with the lords of the North, they brought down the greatest dynasty this world has ever known. I'd like to borrow one of your birds. Cersei will expect a reply."
3867,"Look, we are thousands of miles from Westeros. . What am I? . One more drunk dwarf.",Slaves.
3868,We're going to meet the Saviour! You should have told me. Who doesn't want to meet the Saviour?,Come on. Let's find a brothel.
3869,"See? We blend right in. Just two more travellers, mad with lust.",Thank you.
3870,What makes you worth that much?,I'm magic. .
3871,Where're you going?,I need to speak to someone with hair.
3872,Hello?,Hello.
3873,"Do I look like a man without money? . Never trust looks. Until quite recently, I was one of the richest men in the world. . But who needs wealth when you can make a woman laugh? . I always pay my debts, I'm well known for it.",You like her? They all like her. They all want to fuck a queen.
3874,You like her? They all like her. They all want to fuck a queen.,That's because they've never met a queen.
3875,Why?,Because you have a skeptical mind.
3876,"Gladly, but this, I can't do. Believe me, no one is more shocked than I am. I hope it passes. What will I do in my spare time? I'll go for a piss, that's a start.","No need to worry, I was just - . Oh, I thought you were someone else. Shows almost over. I'm sure the girls inside will be happy to oblige."
3877,Is that Estermont?,"Tarth, Ser Jaime. . The Sapphire Isle."
3878,Why are we on a merchant ship? Why no Lannister sails?,"This ship's sailing to Oldtown. We'll get off earlier, not far from Sunspear. Row ourselves to the Dornish shores in the night."
3879,You ever been to Dorne?,No.
3880,Your niece?,I've been doing this sort of thing a long time. I'm good at it. .
3881,"I know. Why are you here? Why not send 40 of me, or an army? Unlike most folks, you actually got one.",Because I don't want to start a war.
3882,"You set your brother free, didn't you? I bet your sister didn't like that.",Varys set him free.
3883,How much can the Crown afford?,"With winter coming, half what they ask. Less."
3884,You're the Master of Coin. How do we pay them?,"Well, House Tyrell could front the gold, and the the Crown will pay us back in time, or I'll have words with my daughter."
3885,Me? .,"We must send an envoy to the Iron Bank, someone of importance, to show these bankers our respect. As the King's Master of Coin, I can think of no one more qualified."
3886,My very own Kingsguard? Please express -,"Safe travels, Lord Tyrell."
3887,"May I offer you some wine, Your Holiness?",No. .
3888,How may I serve?,All over Westeros we hear about septs being burned. Silent sisters raped. Bodies of holy men piled in the streets.
3889,What would you say if I told you we have a great sinner in our very midst? Shielded by gold and privilege.,May the Father judge him justly. .
3890,Who do you think you are?,Justice. .
3891,Why is my brother in a cell?,"I, I don't know. I, I didn't order it."
3892,Are you saying my mother is behind this?,She's jealous you're not hers anymore. Arresting my brother is her revenge.
3893,Aren't you and mother getting along?,"Oh, my sweet, sweet King. . Do you have any affection for me at all?"
3894,"Oh, my sweet, sweet King. . Do you have any affection for me at all?",Of course I do. You're my Queen.
3895,Do you promise?,I demand that Ser Loras be freed now!
3896,Did I arrest him?,"Well, no... But you armed the Faith Militant. You gave the High Sparrow an army."
3897,Then can I tell Margaery you'll have Ser Loras released?,"I told you I am not holding Ser Loras. You're the King. I'm sure if you speak to the High Sparrow, he'll release the poor boy."
3898,"You mean, kill them? Here, in the sept?",You'll be sending them to meet the Gods that they love.
3899,My Queen?,There was no way to free Ser Loras without violence.
3900,Are you? When?,I--I don't know.
3901,You don't know?,He was praying just now.
3902,Will you come back later? .,"I need to be with my family, Your Grace. ."
3903,Whose then? . I gave you nothing but weakness. . And deformity. .,Those scars mean nothing to the Lord of Light.
3904,You march on Winterfell soon?,We must. To beat the snows.
3905,"And you, my Lady, what do you need?",To serve my Lord.
3906,And how many men does this Lord Mazin have to send us?,More than Lord Wibberley.
3907,How can I help you?,"Come with us when we ride south. . None of us know the castle as well as you do. Its hidden tunnels, its weaknesses, its people. Winterfell was your home once. Don't you want to chase the rats out of it? ."
3908,"Come with us when we ride south. . None of us know the castle as well as you do. Its hidden tunnels, its weaknesses, its people. Winterfell was your home once. Don't you want to chase the rats out of it? .",Castle Black is my home now. Night's Watch takes no part in the wars of the Seven Kingdoms.
3909,"Do you feel my heart beating? This power in you, you resist it, and that's your mistake. Embrace it.","The Lord of Light made us male and female. Two parts of a greater whole. We are joining this power. Power to make life, power to make light, and power to cast shadows."
3910,Why?,I swore a vow. . I loved another.
3911,Are you lonely?,Just bored.
3912,"Were you bored a lot, too?","I know Castle Black is no place for a child, but I -"
3913,Why do you say that?,"She told me, ""I don't want to bring you."""
3914,"Are you ashamed of me, father?","When you were an infant, , the Dornish trailer landed on Dragonstone. His goods were junk except for one wooden doll. He'd even sewn a dress on it in the colors of our House. No doubt he'd heard of your birth, and assumed new fathers were easy targets. I still remember how you smiled when I put that doll in your cradle, , and you pressed it to your cheek. . By the time we burnt the doll, it was too late. . I was told you would die. Or worse, the grayscale would go slow. . Let you grow just enough to know the world before taking it away from you. Everyone advised me to send you to the ruins of Valyria to live out your short life with the Stone men, before the sickness spread to the castle. I told them all to go to hell. . I called in every maester on this side of the world. Every healer, every apothecary. They stopped the disease and saved your life. Because you did not belong across the world with the bloody Stone men. . You are the Princess Shireen of House Baratheon. And you are my daughter."
3915,"I saw her once. I was a boy, living with your mother's family. Lord Whent had a great tourney at Harrenhal. Everyone was there. The Mad King, your father, Robert Baratheon. And Lyanna, she was already promised to Robert. You can imagine what it was like for me, a boy from nowhere, with nothing to his name, watching these legendary men, tilting at the lists. The last two riders were Barristan Selmy and Rhaegar Targaryen. When Rhaegar won, everyone cheered for the prince. I remember the girls laughing when he took off his helmet and they saw that silver hair. How handsome he was. Until he rode right past his wife, Elia Martell, and all the smiles died. I've never seen so many people so quiet. He rode past his wife, and he lay a crown of winter roses in Lyanna's lap. Blue as frost. How many tens of thousands had to die because Rhaegar chose your aunt?","Yes, he chose her… and then he kidnapped her and raped her."
3916,Dressed for riding?,I am.
3917,Where are you going?,King's Landing.
3918,King's Landing?,Cersei sent for me. . We must not let her sniff out any trouble.
3919,How do you know?,"Stannis Baratheon garrisons at Castle Black. He'll march south to King's Landing before the winter snows block his way. But first, he has to take Winterfell."
3920,You think he'll defeat the Boltons?,"He has a larger army. He's the finest military commander in Westeros. A betting man would put his money on Stannis. . As it happens, I am a betting man."
3921,And if you're right?,"Stannis takes Winterfell, he rescues you from the most despised family in the North. Grateful for your late father's courageous support for his claim, he names you Wardeness of the North."
3922,"What if you're wrong? What if Stannis never attacks Winterfell, or he does and the Boltons defeat him?","Then you will take this Bolton boy, Ramsay, and make him yours."
3923,"He should, he's a dangerous man. But even the most dangerous men can be outmaneuvered. And you've learnt to maneuver from the very best. . I return before too long. . You'll be strong without me. . The North will be yours. Do you believe me?",I expect I'll be a married woman by the time you return.
3924,"No? Two knights, off to rescue a princess. Sounds like a good song to me.",Sounds like all the rest.
3925,What about you? What shit way would you choose?,"In my own keep, drinking my own wine, watching my sons grovel for my fortune."
3926,I've had an exciting life. I want my death to be boring. How do you want to go?,In the arms of the woman I love.
3927,She want the same thing?,Let's go.
3928,"The captain to that ship… What was he, Braavosi?",Pentoshi.
3929,And he's headed to Oldtown?,As I said. Why?
3930,As I said. Why?,What's to stop him from docking down the coast and telling the locals that Jaime Lannister's in Dorne?
3931,What's to stop him from docking down the coast and telling the locals that Jaime Lannister's in Dorne?,A bag of gold.
3932,How many you count?,Four.
3933,How many you think you can take?,"One, if he's slow."
3934,Who are you?,Cooper. . This is Darnell.
3935,Accent gave me away? Flea Bottom. Whelped and whipped.,Why are you here?
3936,Why are you here?,"Our ship capsized in the night. We managed to swim ashore. It was a near thing, really."
3937,Do you know how long it will take us to dig all those holes?,"I can't dig very well with one hand. Not at all, really."
3938,Will it be war?,"Prince Doran will weep for your father, but nothing else. We must avenge Oberyn ourselves."
3939,Nym? . Obara?,"When I was a child, , Oberyn came to take me to court. I'd never seen this man, and yet he called himself my father. My mother wept, said I was too young, and a girl."
3940,Thank you. . Who are you?,Your captor.
3941,Do you have wine?,No.
3942,What business would you have with the Queen?,"Gold and glory. Oh, and hate. If you've ever met my sister, you'd understand. So now that it's clear we're on the same side? . A high born knight from the North of Westeros, down on his luck in Essos. Dragon epaulettes? Bear sigil breast plate. You're Jorah Mormont. I have to ask how, exactly, were you serving your Queen in a whore house, half a world away? Is it possible, that you were running? Why would you be running? And why would she have sent you away? Oh, wait! You were spying on her, weren't you? It's all coming back to me! I was drunk through most of the Small Council meetings, but it's all coming back. You passed notes to Varys's little birds. She found out, didn't she? Found out, and exiled you. . And now you hope to win back her favor with a gift. A risky scheme. One might even say, desperate. Do you think Daenerys would execute me, and pardon you? I'd say the reverse is just as likely."

3944,Everyone looks happy enough from up here. . What?,"I was thinking of all the times your brother made me go with him down from the Red Keep, into the streets of King's Landing."
3945,Why?,"He liked to walk among the people, he liked to sing to them."
3946,He sang to them?,Yes. Rhaegar would take a spot on the Hook or the Street of Seeds and then he'd sing. Just like all the other minstrels.
3947,And what did you do?,I made sure no one killed him. And I collected the money. . Well he liked to see how much he could make.
3948,He was good?,He was very good. Viserys never told you?
3949,He was very good. Viserys never told you?,He told me Rhaegar was good at killing people. .
3950,And what did you do with the money?,"Well, one time, he gave it to the next minstrel down the street. One time, he gave it to an orphanage in Flea Bottom. One time... we got horribly drunk. ."
3951,How many others are there?,Fifty a hundred.
3952,"Will you be joining us, Ser Barristan?",I think I can protect you from Hizdahr Zo Loraq.
3953,Glory?,"Why else do men fight? Why did your ancestors cross the Narrow Sea and conquer the Seven Kingdoms? So their names would live on. Those who find victory in the fighting pits, will never become kings, but their names will live on. It's the best chance they'll ever have."

Those who find victory in the fighting pits, will never become kings, but their names will live on. It's the best chance they'll ever have.",Is that what you used to tell men before you set them to butchering each other for sport?
3955,Is that what you used to tell men before you set them to butchering each other for sport?,"Your Grace, today is the traditional start of the fighting season."
3956,"Who is innocent? Maybe all of you are, , maybe none of you are. Maybe, , I should let the dragons decide.",All men must die.
3957,How are you feeling?,"Oh, like a hundred-year-old man slowly freezing to death."
3958,Where are the rest of the free folk now? . Where have they gone? . Who leads them?,They followed Mance. They won't follow anyone else.
3959,What about you?,Hard to lead when you're in chains.
3960,What if I unchained you?,Why would you do that?
3961,Why would you do that?,Because you are not my enemy. And I'm not yours.
3962,And now everything is going to change?,It is.
3963,Why now?,"Because now, , I am Lord Commander of the Night's Watch."
3964,"What would you have me do, , Lord Commander?",I'd have you go north of the Wall. Gather the remaining free folk wherever they are and bring them back here. I'll open the gates for them and let them through. I'll find them lands to settle south of the Wall.
3965,"And how many of your people can't fight? The women, the children, the old, the sick, what happens to them? You're condemning them to death. Worse than death because you're too proud to make peace. Or maybe you're not proud. Maybe you're just a coward.",Easy thing to say to a man in chains.
3966,Most of them are at Hardhome. You know where that is?,Up on Storroldo s Point. I can give you 10 horses and nine other men. You can get there in a week.
3967,"You'd bring wildlings here, through our gates?","Men, women, and children will die by the thousands if we do nothing."
3968,What?,Nothing.
3969,And why do you think the farmers abandoned those villages? Because the wildlings raided them for years. Cut them down! Just like they did this boy's people.,We've been fighting them all for thousands of years. They've slaughtered villages. They've slaughtered our brothers.
3970,"You don't mean it, do you? Telling the wildlings you want to make peace. You're just doing it to trick them.",It's not a trick.

3977,That doesn't release me from an oath. I served Lady Catelyn. I serve her still. Who do you serve?,Come back here. Myranda.
3978,Do you think she's pretty?,Of course I do. I'm not blind.
3979,"You're the kennel master's daughter. Who are you going to marry, the stable keeper's son? . You're mine. You're not going anywhere. Unless I have to listen to more of your jealousy. Jealousy bores me. You remember what happens to people who bore me. You're not going to bore me, are you, Myranda?",Never.
3980,I like your dress. Who made it for you?,I made it myself.
3981,Really?,"Who, who are you?"
3982,"Who, who are you?","I'm Myranda, the kennel master's daughter. May I? . Oh, wonderful. The stitching. Who taught you?"
3983,"I'm Myranda, the kennel master's daughter. May I? . Oh, wonderful. The stitching. Who taught you?",My mother. .
3984,What is it?,"That would spoil the surprise. Go ahead, it's perfectly safe. You won't believe it when you see it."
3985,Theon?,You shouldn't be here.
3986,Do you have something to tell me?,"No, my lord."
3987,Who?,Sansa. Lady Sansa. She came to the kennels.
3988,She saw you?,"Yes. I'm sorry, master. Forgive me. I didn't think -"
3989,"I heard you two had reunited. A fitting place for it. . I like to imagine that the last time you spoke was in this very room. Are you still angry with him after he - what he did? Don't worry. The North remembers. I punished him for it. He's not ironborn anymore. Not Theon Greyjoy anymore. He's a new man. A new person, anyway. Aren't you, Reek?","Yes, master."
3990,Why are you doing this?,"Because Reek has something to say to you. Don't you, Reek? . An apology. Apologize to Lady Sansa for what you did. Apologize for murdering her two brothers."
3991,"Because Reek has something to say to you. Don't you, Reek? . An apology. Apologize to Lady Sansa for what you did. Apologize for murdering her two brothers.",I'm sorry.
3992,Sorry about what?,For killing your brothers.
3993,"There, over and done with. Doesn't everyone feel better? I do. That was getting very tense. Whew. . You know what, my lady? What with him having murdered your brothers and the rest of your family gone Reek here is the nearest thing to living kin that you have left. Reek. You will give away the bride. Someone has to. What better person? Good? Good?","Yes, yes, very good."
3994,How can you be sure?,Sure of what?
3995,Sure of what?,That she's pregnant. I mean how can you tell?
3996,That she's pregnant. I mean how can you tell?,Maester Wolkan has assured us beyond all doubt.
3997,So how did you manage it?,Manage what?
3998,Manage what?,Getting her pregnant.
3999,"Of course, but how did you find it?","You disgraced yourself at dinner, parading that creature before the Stark girl."
4000,And if it's a boy?,You're worried about your position.
4001,"Why would I? She had me, she died. And here we are.","She was a peasant girl. Pretty in a common sort of way. She was the miller's wife. Apparently they had married without my knowledge or consent. So I had him hanged and I took her beneath the tree where he was swaying. She fought me the whole time. She was lucky I didn't hang her, too. A year later she came to my gates with a squalling baby in her arms. A baby she claimed was mine. I nearly had her whipped and the child thrown in the river. . But then I looked at you and I saw then what I see now. You are my son. . Stannis Baratheon has an army at Castle Black. But he won't stay for long. He wants the Iron Throne, and the road to King's Landing comes right through Winterfell. He means to take the North. But the North is ours. It's yours and mine. Will you help me defeat him?"

4003,Is this every book there is?,Every book there is?
4004,Every book there is?,In the world.
4005,"Where you grew up, were there more books?",My father's not the most literate man. They say the Citadel has the largest library in the world.
4006,Where's that?,The Citadel? In Oldtown.
4007,The Citadel? In Oldtown.,I'm sorry I don't know things.
4008,Why does the Citadel have the biggest library?,It's where they train the maesters.
4009,Like Maester Aemon?,"I wanted to be one when I was young. Instead, I became a man of the Night's Watch. Far more adventure up here anyway. I wouldn't have met you."
4010,You're Samwell Tarly?,"I am, Your Grace."
4011,How?,With a dagger made of dragonglass.
4012,Dragonglass?,What the maesters call obsidian -
4013,I know what it is. We have it in Dragonstone. Why would obsidian kill a walker?,"I don't know. I've been going through all the old manuscripts hoping to find something, and all I've learned is that the children of the forest used to hunt with dragonglass."
4014,Seen what?,The army of the dead. And when they come -
4015,"Uh, Your Grace. Wouldn't it be better to wait? When Jon Snow returns with the wildlings, we could have thousands more men.","If Jon Snow returns with the wildlings. We can't wait that long. We have the advantage, more men, more horses, all fed and rested. But every day we wait, the odds shift in Bolton's favor. This could turn to winter at any moment. We have to act now. Give the order. We march at sunrise."
4016,"Here? Half these watchmen are killers and rapists. No, they march with us.","As you wish, Your Grace."
4017,Do you think Father will let me go down into the crypt?,Beg your pardon?
4018,Beg your pardon?,At Winterfell. All the Kings in the North are buried there. Bran the Builder and King Dorren and-
4019,Is there going to be a battle?,"Aye, princess, but you won't be anywhere near -"
4020,How long have I been here?,Three days.
4021,Ser Barristan?,"I failed him. I failed my men, I failed my queen."
4022,"You failed no one. You fought bravely. You'll fight again. Are you ashamed? You were ambushed, outnumbered. There was no way you could have known.","This is not why. Wounded in war, there is no shame for this. I am ashamed because when the knife go in and I fall to the ground, I am afraid."
4023,"If I give everyone what they deserve, I'll have no one left to rule. Ser Barristan counseled mercy when I took this city right up to the morning he died. Daario Naharis thinks I should kill the former Masters and let the rest of the city fend for itself. What do you think?","Your Grace, I think that I am not fit to have an opinion on these matters."
4024,You are as fit as anyone I know. You know why I'm here. And you know who will suffer the most if this all falls apart. So what do you think?,"I can only tell you what I have seen, Your Grace. . I have seen you listen to your counselors. I have seen you lean on their experience when your own was lacking and weigh the choices they put before you. And I have seen you ignore your counselors, because there was a better choice. One that only you could see."
4025,"What about ""Valar Morghulis""?",I did not want to die a coward. Apparently I do not want to die at all. .
4026,"Don't worry. I'll be fine. Nothing broken, I don't think. Where are we now? Not the Rhoyne. . Long, sullen silences and an occasional punch in the face. The Mormont way. Let's start over. I apologize for before. My mouth sometimes runs away from me. This doesn't have to be an unpleasant trip. We're going to be spending a lot of time together on the way to Meereen.",We are.
4027,Have you sailed this route before?,No.
4028,You're going to bring Daenerys a souvenir from her ancestral homeland in case I'm not enough?,I think you'll be plenty.
4029,You know what they say. The Doom still rules Valyria. What about the demons and the flames? Aren't you afraid of the Doom?,No. But the pirates are.
4030,The Smoking Sea. How many centuries before we learn how to build cities like this again? Thousands of years the Valyrians were the best in the world at almost everything. And then -,And then they weren't.
4031,What was that?,Stone Men! Don't let them touch you!
4032,Tyrion? Tyrion. Tyrion. Tyrion. You're all right.,You're heavier than you look. Did any of them touch you?
4033,You're heavier than you look. Did any of them touch you?,"You? . I've seen greyscale before, but nothing like that."
4034,"You? . I've seen greyscale before, but nothing like that.",I suppose that's why they send them there.
4035,"It'd be kinder to put daggers in their hearts and be done with it. . Thank you for saving me. Of course, I wouldn't have needed saving if you hadn't kidnapped me in the first place. . So what now?","We walk, up the coast. With luck, we'll find a fishing village. Maybe another boat."
4036,Without luck?,"We've got a long walk ahead of us. I'll get some wood for a fire. Try to get some rest, huh?"
4037,"We've got a long walk ahead of us. I'll get some wood for a fire. Try to get some rest, huh?",That's the best idea you've had all day.
4038,What are they doing with the bodies?,Get back to work.
4039,When?,When it's time. Not before. Get back to work.
4040,When do I get to play the game?,Game?
4041,Game?,The game. The game of faces.
4042,Who are you?,No one.
4043,Well who are you? What are you doing here? How'd you get here?,"I'm from Westeros. Just like you. Daughter of a Lord. Just like you. Except I was an only child. Heir to his fortune. My mother died. My father remarried and his new wife gave birth to a girl. My stepmother didn't want any rivals for her precious daughter so she tried to kill me with poison. I found out, sought help from the Faceless Men and my father was widowed again. I've been serving them ever since."
4044,Was that true or a lie?,What?
4045,What?,Did you believe every word I said?
4046,Did you believe every word I said?,Who are you?
4047,Who are you?,Arya.
4048,And where did you come from?,Westeros. My family home is Winterfell. I'm the youngest daughter of a great lord. Eddard Stark. He died in battle.
4049,The girl lies. To me. To the Many Faced God. To herself. Does she truly want to be no one?,Yes.
4050,You're not hungry?,Of course I'm hungry.
4051,"You're an awful travelling companion, do you know that? Possibly the least charming man I have ever met.",I am not your travelling companion.
4052,Do you ever shut up?,I sailed from King's Landing to Pentos in a crate. Without ever saying a word.
4053,Why?,Never occurred to you to ask why until now? You never wondered why Tyrion Lannister decided to visit a brothel in Volantis.
4054,Never occurred to you to ask why until now? You never wondered why Tyrion Lannister decided to visit a brothel in Volantis.,I'm sure you've visited many brothels in many cities.
4055,What do you know about my father?,"I met him. I visited the Wall. When I asked him about his men he knew all the stories, every one of them. He actually cared about the people in his command. How did they put it in the Watch? “We shall never see his like again.”"
4056,"I met him. I visited the Wall. When I asked him about his men he knew all the stories, every one of them. He actually cared about the people in his command. How did they put it in the Watch? “We shall never see his like again.”",You didn't know. I'm sorry. I am.
4057,How?,I only know what I heard
4058,"Is the girl ready to give up her ears, her nose, her tongue, her hopes and dreams, her loves and hates, all that makes a girl who she is, forever?",No. The girl is not ready to become no one. But she is ready to become someone else.
4059,"Why Daenerys? Why is she worth all this? As I recall, the Mormonts fought against the Targaryens during Robert's Rebellion.",Do you believe in anything?
4060,Do you believe in anything?,I believe in many things.
4061,"In something greater than ourselves, I mean. The Gods. Destiny. Do you believe there's a plan for this world?",No.
4062,"Neither did I. I was a cynic, just like you. Then I saw a girl step into a great fire with three stone eggs. When the fire burned out I thought I'd find her blackened bones. Instead I found her. Daenerys. Alive and unhurt. Holding her baby dragons. Have you ever heard baby dragons singing?",It's hard to be a cynic after that.
4063,"The Targaryens are famously insane. What if she conquers the world? Then what? 1,000 years of peace and prosperity?",First we have to conquer the world.
4064,"We? Alright, let's assume your dreams come true. She's ecstatic when you bring her this enemy dwarf. She hacks off my head and restores your position. You command her army, sail to Westeros, defeat all your enemies, then watch as she climbs those steps and sits on the Iron Throne. Hurrah, long live the Queen. Then what?",Then she rules.
4065,So a woman who has not spent a single day of her adult life in Westeros becomes the ruler of Westeros? That's justice?,She is the rightful heir.
4066,"Why, because her father who burned living men for amusement was the king?",Shh! It's a slave ship
4067,Why is it anchored?,They probably came ashore for--
4068,"Got a lot of fight in you, huh?",Salt mines.
4069,What about the dwarf?,Worthless. Cut his throat.
4070,"Wait, wait, wait, wait! You can't just hand a dried cock to a merchant and expect him to pay for it. He has to know it came from a dwarf. And how could he know unless he sees the dwarf?",It will be a dwarf-sized cock.
4071,Him? He's got to be 60 years old.,"Sure, he's a bit long in the tooth, a bit withered, been in the sun too long. We can all see that. But he is a veteran of 100 battles. They wrote songs about him!"
4072,Is that true?,"He won the tournament at Lannisport, unseating Ser Jaime Lannister himself."
4073,Yes? Lancel Lannister.,Brother Lancel. We abandoned our family names.
4074,I'm here on urgent business for the Queen Mother. Should I send word that I'll be delayed?,"Step carefully, Lord Baelish. You'll find that there's little tolerance for flesh peddlers in the new King's Landing."
4075,"Do you think it's wise, your Grace, arresting the heir to Highgarden?",The Faith arrested the heir to Highgarden.
4076,The King's orders. Is the King to blame for Ser Loras' perversion?,House Tyrell won't tolerate these insults.
4077,"House Tyrell won't tolerate it? I'm the insulted party, Lord Baelish. Ser Loras was promised to me, instead he chose the company of boys.",One's choice of companion is a curious thing.
4078,If war comes to Westeros will the Knights of the Veil fight for their king?,Young Lord Robyn heeds my advice. And I have always counseled loyalty to the throne.
4079,"Patience? Sansa helped murder my son, Roose Bolton is a traitor.","Stannis Baratheon is also a traitor, marching with his army on Winterfell. Let Stannis and Roose battle, let the enemies of the throne slaughter each other and when they're done seize Winterfell from whichever thief survives."
4080,"You wouldn't risk a single Lannister soldier or a single coin from the Royal Treasury. What do you have to lose, a brothel keeper?",And if you succeed?
4081,And if you succeed?,Name me Warden of the North.
4082,What if he says no?,He won't. You've waited long enough. I want you to be my wife now. What is it?
4083,He won't. You've waited long enough. I want you to be my wife now. What is it?,"Do you want to marry me because our families arranged it, or do you…"
4084,Why not?,You know why not. Someone will see.
4085,How many other girls have you walked through these gardens?,I like the way your eyes go squinty when you're jealous.
4086,"Once we got the princess, then what?",I like to improvise.
4087,"Uncle Jaime? I don't understand, what are you doing here?",Let's speak in private.
4088,"Why don't you let them have some time alone, son?",Let's not do something stupid.
4089,I am Obara Sand. Daughter of Oberyn Martell. I fight for Dorne. Who do you fight for?,Drop your weapons!
4090,I was as shocked as anyone when The Faith arrested Ser Loras. I have no love for these fanatics. But what can the queen mother do?,"Has the crown suddenly stopped needing the troops, gold, and wheat my house supplies?"
4091,"Has the crown suddenly stopped needing the troops, gold, and wheat my house supplies?",I assure you our alliance with House Tyrell remains--
4092,Do you expect the alliance to continue after you've thrown our future into prison?,"As I said, i didn't imprison anyone. As for your veiled threats--"
4093,What veil?,The Lannister-Tyrell alliance brought peace to a war-torn country. Do you really want to see the Seven Kingdoms slide back into warfare?
4094,The Lannister-Tyrell alliance brought peace to a war-torn country. Do you really want to see the Seven Kingdoms slide back into warfare?,I didn't trust your father. I didn't particularly like him. But I respected him. He was no fool. He understood that sometimes we must work with our rivals rather than destroy them.
4095,You are aware of the rumors concerning you and Renly?,I don't pay attention to rumors.
4096,"Wasn't Joffrey your king? He was anointed by the 7, not Renly.",I was wrong to support Renly's claim. I know that. But I was forgiven by Joffrey. I fought for him at the Battle of the Blackwater.
4097,Why does it matter what I wore?,"Do you deny all of the charges against you? Fornication, buggery, blasphemy."
4098,"Do you deny all of the charges against you? Fornication, buggery, blasphemy.",Of course I deny them.
4099,You call me forward?,Yes. We have some questions for you.
4100,How do you respond to these charges against your brother?,They are lies.
4101,All of them?,All of them.
4102,"Queen Margaery, in the presence of the gods, do you swear that your brother is innocent of these charges against him, to the best of your knowledge?","Yes, I swear it."
4103,Do you know this man?,"Yes, very well. He is Ser Loras Tyrell, heir to Highgarden."
4104,How did you come to meet?,I squired for him. He took a liking to me. He summoned me to his chamber the first day we met.
4105,And what occurred in his chamber?,We engaged in intimate relations.
4106,You laid with him?,That night and many others.
4107,Is there anyone else who can support your claim?,"Yes, yes, Queen Margaery. She walked in on us once not long ago. She didn't seem surprised."
4108,This testimony is an insult to a great house. Why should The Faith or anyone else take the word of a squire over the heir to Highgarden?,"He has a birthmark, your grace. Quite high on his thigh, wine-colored, and roughly the shape of Dorne."
4109,What are you doing? Let us pass.,The Faith is satisfied that there is enough evidence to bring a formal trial for Ser Loras... and Queen Margaery.
4110,What?,Bearing false witness before the gods is as grave a sin as any. Take her.
4111,What do you want?,"Lord Ramsay sent me to draw your bath, my lady. You want to be clean and fresh for your new husband don't you?"
4112,"Lord Ramsay sent me to draw your bath, my lady. You want to be clean and fresh for your new husband don't you?","You're so beautiful. But if you need to keep him happy. Ramsay gets bored easily. You dont want to end up like... Well, like the others."
4113,What others?,I shouldn't gossip. It's good to see the red again. No point in hiding anymore.
4114,"Let's see. There was Kiera. The blacksmith's daughter. She was tall. Like you. Lovely figure. But she talked and talked and talked and… Ramsay got tired of that. Then there was Violet. She had gorgeous blond hair. But she got pregnant and, well, that was boring. Then Tamsay. Such a sweet girl. Of course sweet girls get a bit dull after a while, don't they? Ramsay let me come with him on that hunt.",Hunt?
4115,Hunt?,"Mm. Have you ever seen a body after the dogs have been at it? Not so pretty. But it's your wedding day, why am I talking about such things?"
4116,"Mm. Have you ever seen a body after the dogs have been at it? Not so pretty. But it's your wedding day, why am I talking about such things?",What was your name again?
4117,What was your name again?,Myranda.
4118,"And how long have you loved him, Myranda. Did you imagine that he would be with you forever, is that it? Then I came along and ruined it. I am Sansa Stark of Winterfell. This is my home and you can't frighten me.","Are you done with your bath, my lady?"
4119,"Are you done with your bath, my lady?",Go. I can finish on my own.
4120,Yes?,"I've come to escort you to the Godswood, my lady. If you please, my lady, will you take my arm?"
4121,"I've come to escort you to the Godswood, my lady. If you please, my lady, will you take my arm?",No.
4122,Who comes before the Old Gods this night?,"Sansa of the House Stark comes here to be wed. A woman grown, trueborn and noble. She comes to beg the blessings of the gods. Who comes to claim her?"
4123,"Sansa of the House Stark comes here to be wed. A woman grown, trueborn and noble. She comes to beg the blessings of the gods. Who comes to claim her?",Ramsay of House Bolton. Heir to the Dreadfort and Winterfell. Who gives her?
4124,Ramsay of House Bolton. Heir to the Dreadfort and Winterfell. Who gives her?,Theon of House Greyjoy. Who was… who was her father's ward.
4125,"Lady Sansa, will you take this man?",I take this man.
4126,Are you pleased my lady?,Good. I want you to be happy. My father said you're still a virgin.
4127,Why? Why are you still a virgin? Afraid of dwarves?,"Lord Tyrion was kind, he was gentle, he never touched me."
4128,You're not lying to me?,"No, my lord."
4129,"Lying to your husband on his wedding night, that would be a very bad way to start a marriage. We are man and wife now, we should be honest with each other, don't you think?",Yes sir.
4130,"Oh, no no no. You stay here Reek. You watch. Do I need to ask a second time? I hate asking a second time.",Reek? I told you to watch.
4131,Reek? I told you to watch.,You've known Sansa since she was a girl. Now watch her become a woman.
4132,What did he do to you?,Please…
4133,"Your name is Theon Greyjoy. Last surviving son of Balon Greyjoy, Lord of the Iron Islands, do you hear me? Theon. Promise me.","Yes, Reek?"
4134,"Yes, Reek?",Egg! Egg! Mothers looking for you! Egg!
4135,"When my father told me we were marrying I half expected a fat, bearded beast. Do you know how pleased I was when I saw you? You've made me very happy.","Our scouts report that Stannis Baratheon rides for Winterfell. He's a respected commander. His troops are loyal and battle tested. He's hired thousands of foreign sell swords to bolster his army. But this storm was a stroke of luck for us northerners. Our people are used to fighting in frost. His army's out there now, suffering in the snow. One day I'll be Lord of Winterfell, and Warden of the North. You'll be my Lady and Wardeness."
4136,But isn't your step mother pregnant?,What of it?
4137,What of it?,What happens if she has a boy?
4138,What happens if she has a boy?,Then I'll have a baby brother.
4139,"You didn't know? Yes, he's done very well for himself. Ah. I near forgot why I asked you to join me. Come, my lady.",Your Northern friend. Reek told me you wanted to leave.
4140,Why? Winterfell is your home and I am your husband.,Tough old bird. Everyone talks when I start beating them. But this one. Her heart gave out before I got to her face. We do breed them tough in the North. Bring my wife back to her chamber. It's far too cold out here for a lady. You should hold on to your candles. The nights are so long now.
4141,What else?,The Stormcrows rode off last night.
4142,And?,"This isn't our time, we should head back to Castle Black when the snow clears."
4143,"And you, do you trust yourself?",I trust in the Lord.
4144,Are you sure?,I have seen myself walk along the battlements of Wintefell. I have seen the flayed men banners lowered to the ground.
4145,Have you lost your mind?,Do you doubt me still? After all that you've seen?
4146,Do you doubt me still? After all that you've seen?,There must be another way. Leeches or something.
4147,"Where are you going, huh? Aren't we better looking than the fat man?","The question is, is she pretty down south in the real world, or is she pretty because she's the only girl here?"
4148,"The question is, is she pretty down south in the real world, or is she pretty because she's the only girl here?","Even in White Harbor, I'd want a kiss."
4149,Sam the Slayer. Are you gonna slay me with that sword?,Look at his hands shaking.
4150,"You lying sack of shit! Killed a White Walker, eh? You fatass fuck. Come on, get up. He's your hero. He's a hog!",Leave him alone!
4151,Stubborn little wilding bitch aren't ya?,Sam! Sam! Sam!
4152,What kind of man would I be if I ran away when I saw someone hurting you?,Just promise me that whatever happens you'll take care of little Sam.
4153,Am I hurting you?,Are you sure?
4154,Are you sure?,Oh. Oh my.
4155,13. Do I have 14?,15? 15 golds honors. Do I have 16?
4156,15? 15 golds honors. Do I have 16?,20.
4157,Why?,"We're a team. I'm a great fighter, too."
4158,How long before the king of Mereen comes to claim my pillow?,Don't be ridiculous. My marriage to Hizdahr is political. I think he's smart enough to understand that.
4159,Are you jealous?,Do you think I'm petty enough to speak ill of a man just because he represents competition?
4160,Do you think I'm petty enough to speak ill of a man just because he represents competition?,I do.
4161,So what else can I do?,Marry me instead.
4162,"Why not? You're our queen, you can do as you like.",No. I can't
4163,"I know I'm here to serve my queen and not to give advice, but can I make one more suggestion?",Of course
4164,"For me, it's the knees. You?",Hips.
4165,"A man of the people, is that your game? It's an old game. dull and unconvincing. A man of the people who does Cersei's dirty work for her.",The people always do the dirty work.
4166,What is it you want? Gold? I'll make you the richest septon who ever lived.,What then?
4167,What then?,"I imagine this is strange for you. Everyone you meet has a hidden motive, and you pride yourself on slitting in and out. But I'm telling you a simple truth"
4168,How do they communicate their demands? By raven or horse?,By the holy text. The seven pointed star. If you don't have one in your library I'll give you my own.
4169,"Half the men, women, and children in this foul city break the sacred laws. You live among murderers, thieves, and rapists. And yet you punish Loras for shagging and Margaery for defending her brother?",Yes. The Gods' laws must be applied to all equally.
4170,"Have you ever served the field, Lady Olenna? Have you ever reaped the grain? Has anyone in House Tyrell? A lifetime of wealth and power has left you blind in one eye. You are the few. We are the many. And when the many stop fearing the few…",Lady Olenna.
4171,And more hands. How's Trystane?,He'll be alright.
4172,Why is it happening at all?,Your mother's worried about you. Threats have been made. Dorne is too dangerous for you. I've come to take you home.
4173,"This is my home, this has been my home for years. I didn't want to come here but she told me to. I did what she said, I did my duty and now she's forcing me to go back?",It's for your own good. These are complicated matters.
4174,How's your arm?,Wonderful. Wouldn't feel right to leave Dorne without a new scar.
4175,You think you're leaving Dorne?,No great hurry. Dornish women are the most beautiful women in the world.
4176,I'm not the most beautiful woman you've ever seen?,I've seen quite a few women in all the Seven Kingdoms.
4177,There was a what? In King's Landing you were saying.,Was I?
4178,Was I?,There was a woman more beautiful than I am.
4179,Was there? My memory's not what it was earlier.,How's your arm now?
4180,How's your arm now?,You seem concerned with it. You must really like me.
4181,And how about your head?,My head… You don't even wanna know what's going on in…
4182,The only antidote. Who's the most beautiful woman in the world?,Sorry? Who?
4183,Sorry? Who?,You.
4184,"You've always been rather impressed with yourself, haven't you?",The past is the past. The future is all that's worth discussing. The future of House Tyrell.
4185,"I promise you, Lord Baelish, that our fates are joined. Together we murdered a king. And if my house should fall, I would have nothing to hide. And if i should meet with some accident here at this broken little flesh market, they'll never even find what's left of you. So do you deny a part in all of this?",Cersei summoned me to King's Landing. I dared not refuse her.
4186,And what did she want?,"A piece of info that she know that I had. Neither silence nor lies were an option. But I have other information of which she is unaware. And as you say, our interests are aligned. I have a gift for you."
4187,What kind of gift?,The same kind I gave Cersei. A handsome young man.
4188,What are you doing?,Get him out of my sight.
4189,Who are you?,"I am the gift. It's a pleasure to meet you, Your Grace. My name is Tyrion Lannister."
4190,"This is horrible. Unacceptable. Are they feeding you enough at least? I brought you this. Venison. It's quite good. I had it myself for supper only last night. We did everything we could from the moment they took your brother. Tommen even went to the sept himself to confront the high sparrow, but I fear The Faith has left reason behind.",I know you did this.
4191,"Lies come easily to you. Everyone knows that. But innocence, decency, concern? You're not very good at those, I'm afraid. Perhaps that's why your son was so eager to cast you aside for me.",You're upset. You're not thinking clearly. I'll visit again when you've had a chance to calm down.
4192,Thank you. You saw her?,Yes.
4193,And?,Her accommodations seem sufficient. What happens to her now?
4194,Her accommodations seem sufficient. What happens to her now?,Well she and her brother are both being held under fair suspicion. A trial will be held for each of them to determine if they are guilty of any acts that might constitute a violation of the tenants of the faith.
4195,Who will stand judge?,Seven septons. As it was in all trials before the Targaryens.
4196,Will you be one of them?,I will.
4197,What does The Mother's mercy entail?,"It depends on the situation. The acts themselves, the degree of contrition."
4198,Did you know this chapel is one of the oldest structures in King's Landing?,I think I may have heard at one point.
4199,Who carved this altar do you know?,I'm afraid i don't.
4200,You will order her to let me go! I am the queen! I am the queen! Have you lost your mind? Let me go! You filthy… I am the queen! Let me go!,Look at me. Look at my face. It's the last thing you'll see before you die.
4201,You will not speak. How do I know you are who you say you are?,If only I were otherwise.
4202,If you are Tyrion Lannister why shouldn't I kill you? To pay your family back for what it did to mine,You want revenge against the Lannisters? I killed my mother Joanna Lannister the day I was born. I killed my father Tywin Lannister with a bow to the heart. I am the greatest Lannister killer of our time.
4203,You want revenge against the Lannisters? I killed my mother Joanna Lannister the day I was born. I killed my father Tywin Lannister with a bow to the heart. I am the greatest Lannister killer of our time.,So I should welcome you into my service because you murdered members of your own family?
4204,So I should welcome you into my service because you murdered members of your own family?,Into your service? Your Grace we have only just met. It's too soon to know if you deserve my service.
4205,Into your service? Your Grace we have only just met. It's too soon to know if you deserve my service.,If you'd rather return to the fighting pits just say the word.
4206,And why are you worth meeting? Why should I spend my time listening to you?,Because you can not build a better world on your own. You have no one at your side who understands that land you want to rule. The strengths and the weaknesses of the houses that will either support or oppose you.
4207,So you want to advise me. Very well. What would you have me do with him? I swore I would kill him if he ever returned.,I know.
4208,Why should the people trust a queen who can't keep her promises?,"Whomever Ser Jorah was when he started informing on you, he is no longer that man. I can't remember seeing the same man as devoted to anything as he is to serving you. He claims he would kill for you and die for you, and nothing I have witnessed gives me reason to doubt him. And yet he did betray you."
4209,Did he have an opportunity to confess his betrayals?,"Yes, many opportunities."
4210,And did he?,No. Not until forced to do so.
4211,So I should kill him?,"A ruler who kills those that are devoted to her is not a ruler that inspires devotion. And you're going to need to inspire devotion, and lots of it, if you're ever going to rule across the Narrow Sea. But you cannot have him by your side when you do."
4212,How will she serve him?,She will no longer turn left onto Ragman Lane. She will turn right and go to Ragman Harbor.
4213,What will she do there?,She will see.
4214,See what?,"How can a man tell a girl this. If he knew what she would see, there would be no reason to send her."
4215,Your oysters fresh?,Best in the city.
4216,You wouldn't lie to an old man would you?,Very nice. Give me 4. With vinegar.
4217,"Please I have 3 children. Without me-- here take it you have to, I have 3 children, what will they do? Please you have to! Please! You don't understand?",The man is a gambler. He wages that his sailor's ship will make it to its destination. It is a strange wager for the captain. He only wins if he loses his life.
4218,So why would a captain make the wager in the first place?,A girl tells a man that she has seen.
4219,"But perhaps the gambler loses his bet and decides that he doesn't have to pay after all. A destitute woman and her small child, what can they do to such a man if he keeps their money for himself? To whom can they turn for recourse?",The Many Faced God. You said you didn't know what I would see at the docks.
4220,And then what?,A gift for the Thin Man.
4221,And if she's not?,It is all the same to the Many Faced God.
4222,The charges?,"Fornication, treason, incest, the murder of King Robert."
4223,I wish you'd said it sooner. Any word from Jaime?,"I'm afraid not. Your Grace, Grand Maester Pycelle has summoned your Uncle Kevan back from Casterly Rock to serve as Hand of the King. He now presides over the small council."
4224,"What about my son, the king? If you can visit me then surely the king--","Your arrest, and Queen Margaery's arrest, the king has not taken well. He remains in his chambers, his servants often find his food in the hall. Left untouched."
4225,"Confess? To the High Sparrow? I won't. I made him. I rose him up from nothing, I will not kneel before some barefooted commoner and beg his forgiveness.",Goodbye my queen. The work continues.
4226,"Reek. Why did you tell him, Reek?","I was helping you. You were trying to escape, there is no escape. Not ever. Theon Greyjoy tried to escape. The master knew. He knows everything. He hunted him, he caught him, he strapped him to a cross, and cut away piece after piece until there was no Theon left."
4227,Only what?,I can't..
4228,"Tell me, they weren't what?!",They weren't...
4229,You didn't…?,"Do you know where they went, Bran and Rickon?"
4230,"Do you know where they went, Bran and Rickon?",I can't talk to you anymore.
4231,"And how high can Stannis' horses jump? Our walls have been full repaired our walls have been reinforced. We have enough food for six months. We are more prepared for a siege than they could have ever been. All we have to do is wait for them to freeze, starve, and mutiny.",You disagree?
4232,You disagree?,"Stannis isn't from the North. You are, father. I think you're missing an opportunity to show the people of the North how House Bolton treats southern invaders."
4233,And what do you recommend?,"That we not sit and wait to let Stannis to decide what type of fight this is going to be. That we hit first, and hit hard, and leave a feast for the crows."
4234,So have you decided yet? Whether I'm worthy of your service?,Have you decided yet whether you're going to have me killed?
4235,Have you decided yet whether you're going to have me killed?,It's probably my safest option.
4236,And what would your father do?,My father? Who publicly sentenced me to death? I'd say his thoughts on having me killed were abundantly clear.
4237,My father? Who publicly sentenced me to death? I'd say his thoughts on having me killed were abundantly clear.,Is that why you killed him?
4238,Is that why you killed him?,"Some day if you decide not to execute me, I'll tell you all about why I killed my father. And on that day, should it ever come, we'll need more wine than this."
4239,I'm terrible?,I've heard stories.
4240,Why did you travel to the other side of the world to meet someone terrible?,To see if you were the right kind of terrible.
4241,Which kind is that?,The kind that prevents your people from being even more so.
4242,Varys? King Robert's spy master?,Yes. He was the one who convinced me to come find you. He was my travelling companion before Ser Jorah seized that role for himself.
4243,But you trust him?,"Yes, oddly. He might be the only person in the world that I trust. Besides my brother."
4244,"Your queenly prerogative. I had given up on life until Varys convinced me you might be worth living for. You chop off my head? Well, my final days were interesting.",I'm not going to kill you.
4245,No? Banish me?,No.
4246,Advise you on what?,How to get what I want.
4247,I'm not entirely joking. There's more to the world than Westeros after all. How many hundreds of thousands of lives have you changed for the better here? Perhaps this is where you belong. Where you can do the most good.,I fought so that no child born into Slaver's Bay would ever know what it was like to be bought or sold. I will continue that fight here and beyond. But this is not my home.
4248,"And when you get back to your home, who supports you?",The common people.
4249,"Let's be generous and assume that's going to happen. Here in Slaver's Bay you had the support of the common people and only the common people. What was that like, ruling without the rich? House Targaryen is gone, not a single person who shares your blood is alive to support you. The Starks are gone as well, our two terrible fathers saw to that. The remaining Lannisters won't back you, not ever. Stannis Baratheon won't back you either, his entire claim to the Throne depends on the illegitimacy of yours. That leaves the Tyrells. Not impossible, but not enough.","Lannister, Targaryen, Baratheon, Stark, Tyrell. They're all just spokes on a wheel. This one's on top, then that ones on top and on and on it spins, crushing the people on the ground."
4250,I've been flogged if it makes you happy. I'm the best you've got. If I win at the Great Pit how much can you sell me for?,"You're a free man, you could have gone anywhere, why did you come back?"
4251,"You're a free man, you could have gone anywhere, why did you come back?",Let me fight for her and I belong to you.
4252,Thirsty? Confess.,"I'll get out of here, you realize. Before long."
4253,Does it hurt?,No.
4254,How are you?,I'm not the one who got punched and kicked in the face.
4255,Are you scared?,A little.
4256,Who's there?,Olly.
4257,Now then. How can I help?,It's about the Lord Commander.
4258,Yes?,He's going up to Hardhome to save all them wildlings. Wildlings killed my mom and dad. They killed everyone in my village.
4259,This wasn't a fight. We were farmers and they slaughtered us. So why's he saving them?,"Wildlings are people, just like us. There are good ones and bad ones."
4260,How can he trust him?,"I've seen the army of the dead. I've seen the white walkers, and they're coming for us, for all the living. And when it's time we'll need every last man we can find."
4261,But what if we let the wildings through the gates and they cut our throats while we sleep?,"Jon's taking a risk, but he has to. We don't stand a chance otherwise. Sometimes a man has to make hard choices, choices that might look wrong to others but you know are right in the long run."
4262,You believe that?,With all my heart.
4263,You trust me Jon Snow?,Does that make me a fool?
4264,Does that make me a fool?,We are fools together now.
4265,Last time I saw you the little crow was your prisoner. The other way around now. What happened?,War.
4266,You call that a war? The greatest army the North has ever seen cut to pieces by a southern king.,We should gather the elders find somewhere quiet to talk.
4267,Why aren't you in chains?,He's not my prisoner.
4268,What is he?,We're allies.
4269,"Is that right? You and the pretty crow do a lot of talking, Tormund. And when you're done talking, do you get down on your knees and suck his cock--",Gather the elders and let's talk.
4270,Since when do the crows give 2 shits if we live?,In normal times we wouldn't. But these aren't normal times. The white walkers don't care if a man's Free Folk or Crow. We're all the same to them. Meat to their army. But together we can beat them.
4271,"Beat the white walkers? Good luck with that. Run from them, maybe.",It's not a trick. It's a gift for those who join us.
4272,You saw this?,No. But I trust the man.
4273,And with the things we've seen you don't believe them?,Come with me and I'll share these weapons.
4274,Come with you where?,There are good lands south of the wall. The Night's Watch will allow you through the tunnel and allow your people to farm those lands.
4275,If…?,If you swear you join us when the real war begins.
4276,Where is Mance?,He died.
4277,How?,I put an arrow through his heart.
4278,"You vouch for this man, Tormund?","He's prettier than both my daughters, but he knows how to fight. He's young, but he knows how to lead. He didn't have to come to Hardhome. He came because he needs us. And we need him."
4279,How many are with us? 5000?,I'm not good at counting.
4280,Lokh kif rukh?,Shut the gate.
4281,So should you ! My little girl has gone on. They're gonna let them pass the wall even if you're not there ?,You have my word. I've given orders.
4282,Horses?,"We're still getting a count, but hundreds are dead."
4283,20 men rode into our camp without a single guard sounding the alarm?,The northerners know more about their land than we ever will.
4284,"And if Jon Snow refuses a boy with a scroll, what does the boy say? I didn't name you hand for your expertise in military matters, ride for Castle Black, don't come back empty handed.","Your Grace, perhaps Queen and Princess Shireen could accompany me."
4285,What's this one now?,The Dance of Dragons
4286,Do you like it?,He's beautiful.
4287,"Will you make me a doe, too, so that he can have company?",Of course I will.
4288,But why am I getting a present?,"Because you deserve it. My son was always on me trying to teach me to read. Gods, I was stubborn about it. Made it this far without reading, seemed to me I could make it to the grave. I wish I had listened to them. This is my own poor way of saying thank you for teaching me to be a grown up. I'll be gone for a few days, Princess. I'll want to hear all about the dance of dragons when I'm back."
4289,You don't like it?,You must be cold.
4290,Prince Trystane. How's your jaw?,A fleabite.
4291,What are you doing in Dorne?,"Looking out for the safety of my niece, the princess Myrcella."
4292,King Tommen insists on his sister's return to the capital?,I'm afraid he does.
4293,May I inquire into the fate of my man?,"Tell me, Ser Jaime, in King's Landing, how do they punish a commoner who strikes a prince?"
4294,"Tell me, Ser Jaime, in King's Landing, how do they punish a commoner who strikes a prince?",He said it was just a fleabite. The fault is mine. Bronn is merely a soldier following my orders. If anyone should be punished it's me.
4295,"Why do we play? I'm better than you, I'll always be better than you. Have I ever missed once? I don't think, I can't recall. You must love humiliation or pain. Which do you love most? Humiliation or-- -- pain? That one hurt didn't it? You going to cry? Give up, little sister.",You're going to miss.
4296,You will. You're thinking too much. Now you're nervous. “What if she's right?”,Luck.
4297,Am I going to be happy at the end of this walk?,You'll find out very soon.
4298,"Say it one more time, handsome. Who am I?",The most beautiful woman in the world.
4299,Perhaps some soup instead?,"Oysters, clams, and cockels! Oysters, clams, and cockels! Oysters, clams, and cockels! Oysters, clams, and cock--"
4300,How much for your little clam?,"Oysters, clams, and cockels! Oysters, clams, and cockels!"
4301,"Some oysters, girl! I'm talking to you! Girl?! Are you deaf? Girl?!","Lord Tyrell! On behalf of the Iron Bank, may I be the first to welcome you to the free city of Braavos. I hope your journey was trouble free."
4302,And how goes the harvest in the Reach?,"Vintnors say this might be the best year for red grapes in half a century. If we come to a satisfactory arrangement, I'll be sure to send the Arbor's finest your way."
4303,Did you know that at one point Maegor the third tried to outlaw it in the Seven Kingdoms? Wanted to arrest anyone caught charging interest and cut off both their hands.,Most unfortunate for the glovers.
4304,"If a man charges low interest on a loan then he has nothing to gain and everything to lose, so why charge him? Whereas a reward makes a man willing to gamble.","We are not gamblers here at the Iron Bank, Lord Tyrell."
4305,"Oh, nonsense. Work's over. Do you sing?",I don't have that gift.
4306,You're buying?,"Oh, I'm buying. But I never was good at sharing."
4307,Do you have what I want or not?,Of course. Of course.
4308,"Fresh? Come on, the lads are hungry.",Nothing better for you cock stand than fresh oysters.
4309,Who let this girl in? Shoo shoo!,Good.
4310,And?,The Thin Man wasn't hungry today.
4311,He didn't try to make you pay?,Then maybe he's changed. The Queen will be thrilled to know you'll be bringing her daughter home
4312,"You love her very much, don't you?","Of course, she's my niece."
4313,"You think I disapprove. Why? Because people disapprove of that sort of thing where you are from? They disapproved of Oberyn and me where you are from. Here, no one blinked an eye. 100 years ago, no one would have blinked an eye at you if you had been named Targaryen. It's always changing, who we're supposed to love and who we're not.The only thing that stays the same is that we want who we want.",I know your daughter had no part in the terrible thing that happened to the man I loved. Perhaps even you were innocent of that.
4314,Father. Aren't you cold?,No. What are you reading?
4315,No. What are you reading?,The Dance of Dragons.
4316,What's it about?,"It's the story of the fight between Rhaenyra Targaryen and her half-brother Aegon for control of the Seven Kingdoms. Both of them thought they belonged on the Iron Throne. When people started for declaring for one of them or the other, their fight divided the kingdom in two. Brothers fought brothers. Dragons fought dragons. By the time it was over, thousands were dead. And it was a disaster for the Targaryens as well. They never truly recovered."
4317,The dance of dragons”? Why is that a dance?,That's just what they call it.
4318,"If you had to choose between Rhaenyra and Aegon, who would you have chosen?",I wouldn't have chosen either. It's all the choosing sides that made things so horrible.
4319,It doesn't matter. I want to help you. Is there any way I can help?,Yes there is.
4320,Where's my father? I want to see my father.,"It will all be over soon, Princess."
4321,"Where's my father? No you can't do this, father where are you?!","Let me see my father! Where are you, please?!"
4322,"Let me see my father! Where are you, please?!",It's what the Lord wants. It's a good thing. A great thing.
4323,Where have you been?,Just making sure everything's in order.
4324,"Has your experience ever involved any actual fighting? You, yourself, have you ever tried to kill a man that was trying to kill you?","Whenever I got into the pit against a beast like that one, the crowd saw me, all skin and bone back then, then they saw a pile of angry muscles ready to murder me. They couldn't get their money out fast enough. But the pile of angry muscles never had any muscles here or here . And the big men were always too slow to stop my dagger from going where their muscles weren't. Yes, whenever I saw a beast like that one, standing across from me making his beast faces, I knew I could rest easy."
4325,You don't approve?,There's always been more than enough death in the world for my taste. I can do without it in my leisure time.
4326,"Fair enough, yet -- it's an unpleasant question -- but what great thing has ever been accomplished without killing or cruelty?",It's easy to confuse what is with what ought to be. Especially when what is has worked in your favor.
4327,That is greatness?,That is a vital part of the great city of Meereen. Which has existed long before you arrived and will remain standing long after we have returned to the dirt.
4328,At your command?,If need be.
4329,A Meereenese champion?,How many people will die to make this happen?
4330,How many people will die to make this happen?,If it comes to that they would have died for a good reason.
4331,or a Westerosi Knight?!,"I fight and die for your glory, oh glorious Queen."
4332,How many?,"Nearly half. All the sell-swords, with all the horses."
4333,Your Grace?,Speak up. It can't be worse than mutiny.
4334,So what are you gonna do?,I'm gonna hope they don't learn how to climb the wall.
4335,But… the Dragonglass?,"No one's ever getting that back, now. It wouldn't have mattered anyway, unless we had a mountain of it."
4336,He's made of Valyrian steel. How many Valyrian steel swords are left in the Seven Kingdoms?,Not enough. The first Lord Commander in history to sacrifice the lives of sworn Brothers to save the lives of Wildlings. How's it feel to be friends with the most hated man in Castle Black?
4337,Not enough. The first Lord Commander in history to sacrifice the lives of sworn Brothers to save the lives of Wildlings. How's it feel to be friends with the most hated man in Castle Black?,You were friends with me when I first got here. And I wasn't winning any elections back then.
4338,What?,"I wanted to ask you something. To ask something of you. Send me, Gilly, and the baby to Oldtown so I can become a Maester. That's what I'm meant to be, not this."
4339,"I need you here, Sam. If you leave, who's left to give me advice I trust?","Well, there's Edd."
4340,Sam?,What?
4341,What?,Sam…
4342,How do you know it's Stannis?,He's carrying his flaming heart banners. From the Blackwater. I'll never forget it.
4343,I do not fight for the Boltons. I'm Brienne of Tarth. I was Kingsguard to Renly Baratheon. I was there when he was murdered by a shadow with your face. You murdered him? With blood magic?,I did.
4344,"In the name of Renly of House Baratheon, First of his Name, Rightful King of the Andals and the First Men, Lord of the Seven Kingdoms, and Protector of the Realm, I, Brienne of Tarth, sentence you to die. Do you have any last words?","Go on, do your duty."
4345,"Die? Who said anything about dying? You can't die yet. Your father was Warden of the North, and Ramsay needs you. Though I suppose he doesn't need all of you. Just the parts he'll use to make his heir. Until you've given him a boy or two and he's finished using them. He's got incredible plans for those parts. So. Shall we wait for him to come back, or shall we begin now?",You're leaving it to me? Good. Let's begin.
4346,You're leaving it to me? Good. Let's begin.,Stop! Stop!
4347,"You were the first person on my list, you know. For killing Syrio Forel, remember him? Probably not. I've gotten a few of the others. The Many Faced God stole a few more for me. I'm glad he left me you. Do you know who I am?",I can't hear you.
4348,Do you know who you are?,You're no one. You're nothing.
4349,Why are you crying?,He was my friend.
4350,No he wasn't. Didn't you listen to him?,He was no one.
4351,But if you're… Who's this?,No one at all. Just as a girl should have been before she took a face from the hall.
4352,What's happening?! What's happening?!,I wish you a safe journey home.
4353,And you really believe that?,Have you ever known your mother to like anyone aside from her children?
4354,Have you ever known your mother to like anyone aside from her children?,She likes you.

4553,"Don't you wish we could go back to the day we left? I want to scream at myself, “Don't go, you idiot”",How could we know?
4554,How could we know?,I spent a lot of time thinking about what as ass I was to you I wish I could change everything
4555,Can you forgive me?,There's nothing to forgive
4556,Where will you go?,"Where will we go? If I don't watch over you, Father's ghost will come back and murder me"

4558,Where will we go?,"I can't stay here, not after what happened"
4559,Should we tell the Boltons to pack up and leave?,We'll take it back from them
4560,How many wildlings did you save?,They didn't come here to serve me
4561,You think they'll be safe here if Roose Bolton remains Warden of the North?,Sansa

4565,And Shireen? What happened to the princess?,I saw what happened I saw Stannis' forces defeated in the field

4570,"Do you believe him, Uncle Petyr?","Lord Royce has served the Vale well He;s enjoyed a distinguished military career If we could trust his absolute loyalty, he would make a capable commander in the wars to come"
4571,I think he deserves one more chance What do you say?,Fine
4572,You invite the enemy into our city?,"I did As a clever man once told me, “We make peace with our enemies, not our friends”"
4573,"Yes, that's the military approach And how has that worked here in Meereen? I represent the diplomatic approach",Our queen tried to make peace with the Masters and they tried to murder her
4574,How many days were you a slave?,Long enough to know
4575,"Let's make this simple, shall we? Tell me what you want",We want you to leave Slaver's Bay Take your dragons and your mercenaries and go
4576,You think you're a free man now? You still follow orders Just because your master has silver hair and tits doesn't mean she's not a master,"Friends, friends, friends, please"
4577,What does that mean?,"Instead of abolishing slavery overnight, we will give you seven years to end the practice"
4578,You are a stranger here So why do you represent Meereen in these talks with our enemies?,Because our queen chose me as her advisor Until she returns from her travels --
4579,When does she return?,Soon You have my word
4580,You have made peace with the slavers?,We offered terms
4581,"And you, Grey Worm? You want to drink wine with these men? The men who tore us from our mothers' arms and sold us at auction like cattle?","I am a soldier, not a politician But if there is a chance for peace -- a just peace -- we should take it"

4584,What?,"Our queen She's wild, you know Don't let her size fool you It's hard enough for me and I'm a young man You, I don't think your heart could take it"
4585,"Oh, I don't want to fight you, Jorah the Andal What do I have to gain? If I win, I'm the shit who killed an old man If I lose, I'm the shit who was killed by an old man","You didn't get much discipline as a child, did you?"
4586,"You didn't get much discipline as a child, did you?",None
4587,What are you doing?,It's forbidden to carry weapons in the sacred city
4588,Isn't it forbidden to sneak into their city and steal their khaleesi?,"If they spot us and we're unarmed, we'll say we're traders heading for the Western Market But if they see weapons…"
4589,You know what happens?,I know what happens
4590,My friends...We wandered off from the Western Market and got lost Could you show us the way back?,What do you sell?
4591,What do you sell?,"Wine Come down to my stall tomorrow, I'll give you a cask of the Arbor's finest"

4601,Shh. Have you -- have you told them that? That you don't care?,I just want it to stop. Help me.
4602,What are you doing here?,I am advising the king on our current predicament.
4603,Is this a Small Council meeting?,Obviously not. I'm here to lend my wisdom and my support.
4604,Look at me. What did they do to me? To the king's own mother?,It's all right. It's done. It's in the past. And of course Margaery's safety is paramount.
4605,"You don't like Margaery, do you?","Whether I like her or not is completely unimportant. Margaery is the queen. Queens must command respect. Kings even more so. Not just for their own sake, but for everyone's. The High Sparrow has no respect for kings or queens. No respect for anything in this world. He has no use for the things of this world. He want to knock them down and replace them with what? With fantasies. With beggars in the street. With nothing."

With fantasies. With beggars in the street. With nothing.",Mother...there's something I want to tell you. Something the High Sparrow told me.
4607,You've spoken with him?,I promised him I wouldn't tell anyone. If he found out I told --
4608,"My dear, you have been stripped of your dignity and authority, publicly shamed, and confined to the Red Keep. What's left to work with?",Cersei is the mother of the king. She has the king's ear and his trust. And the king has been speaking regularly with the High Sparrow about Queen Margaery and Ser Loras.
4609,"You'll take no action at all. When the Tyrell armies come, you will stand down. Are you expressly forbidden from standing down?","No, but if the king should call on me --"
4610,"The whole thing will be over before anyone can call on you to do anything. When the High Sparrow is in custody or dead, preferably, and Margaery's back at Tommen's side, do you think the king will be angry at the outcome?",You hate these fanatics as much as we do. You hate what they've done to your son. Do you want Lancel back or have you given him up for good?
4611,You hate these fanatics as much as we do. You hate what they've done to your son. Do you want Lancel back or have you given him up for good?,Of course I want him back.
4612,"They told me you were home and I didn't believe it. “Theon Greyjoy?” I said. “He's dead. He's been dead a long time."" He let you go?",I escaped.
4613,Why did you come here?,Where else could I go?
4614,Where else could I go?,You heard father was dead and thought you'd claim the crown?
4615,You heard father was dead and thought you'd claim the crown?,"No, no. I only heard he died after we docked."

4617,You think any Ironborn wants you to be king? After what you've done?,I don't want to be king.
4618,What do you want?,I shouldo ve listened to you. You're the only one --
4619,They've cleaned you up nicely. You know who I am?,A lord?
4620,A lord?,Yes. A lord. You've seen my banners?
4621,Yes. A lord. You've seen my banners?,The flayed man.
4622,Does that worry you at all?,You eat them after?
4623,You eat them after?,No.
4624,You served the Starks?,"Aye. They put me in chains and put a sword at my throat, so I've served them."
4625,"Be that as it may, Rickon's not yours to sell anymore. He's mine. So what use could I possibly have for you?",I can give you what you want.
4626,Are you sure you know what that is?,comes closer and sits down on his lap. They kiss.
4627,That so?,I had to work hard to get him talking. But he talked. They all do.
4628,How many men does he have in his army?,"I heard him say 5,000 once when he was talking about Stannis's attack."
4629,How many do you have?,"That can march and fight? 2,000. The rest are children and old people."
4630,"That can march and fight? 2,000. The rest are children and old people.",You're the son of the last true Warden of the North. Northern families are loyal. They'll fight for you if you ask.
4631,Who cares about her? She's a midget.,I like her.
4632,"The Wise Masters of Yunkai want her. They're offering ten thousand horses In exchange. What's worth more, one pink little girl or ten thousand horses?",Fuck the Wise Masters in their perfumed asses. I'll take their horses for myself.
4633,Don't you want to know what I think?,You'd rather be sold to slavery? Or maybe you'd like to show Rhalko here what you taste like?
4634,You'd rather be sold to slavery? Or maybe you'd like to show Rhalko here what you taste like?,No. I don't want either of those things.
4635,"And what happened? You trusted a sorceress, like a fool. Your baby is dead because of you. And so is Khal Drogo.",This is where Drogo promised to take his khalasar west to where the world ends. To ride wooden horses across the Black Salt Sea as no khal has done before. He promised to kill the men in their iron suits and tear down their stone houses. He swore to me before the Mother of Mountains.
4636,And you were dumb enough to believe him?,"And here, now, what great matters do the Great Khals discuss? Which little villages you'll raid, how many girls you'll get to fuck, how many horses you'll demand in tribute. You are small men. None of you are fit to lead the Dothraki. But I am. So I will."
4637,"And here, now, what great matters do the Great Khals discuss? Which little villages you'll raid, how many girls you'll get to fuck, how many horses you'll demand in tribute. You are small men. None of you are fit to lead the Dothraki. But I am. So I will.",All right. No Dosh Khaleen for you. Instead we'll take turns fucking you. And then we'll let our bloodriders fuck you.
4638,"And If there's anything left of you, we'll give our horses a turn. You crazy cunt. Did you really think we would serve you?",lays her hand on a fire pit.
4639,Yes?,"For you, my lady."
4640,How far is Mole's Town?,"Sansa. Lady Brienne. When I heard you had escaped WInterfell, I feared the worst. You have no idea how happy I am to see you unharmed."
4641,Unharmed? What are you doing here?,I rode north with the Knights of the Vale to come to your aid. They're encamped at Moat Cailin as we speak.
4642,"To come to my aid? Did you know about Ramsay? If you didn't know, you're an idiot. If you did know, you're my enemy.","Would you like to hear about our wedding night? He never hurt my face. He needed my face, the face of Ned Stark's daughter. But the rest of me, he did what he liked with the rest of me as long as I could still give him an heir. What do you think he did?"
4643,"Would you like to hear about our wedding night? He never hurt my face. He needed my face, the face of Ned Stark's daughter. But the rest of me, he did what he liked with the rest of me as long as I could still give him an heir. What do you think he did?",I can't begin to contemplate --
4644,What do you think he did to me?,Lady Sansa asked you a question.
4645,"Yes, he enjoyed that. What else do you think he did?","Sansa, I --"
4646,What else?,Did he cut you?
4647,Did he cut you?,Maybe you did know about Ramsay all along.
4648,I don't believe you anymore. I don't need you anymore. You can't protect me. You won't even be able to protect yourself if I tell Brienne to cut you down. And why shouldn't I?,"Do you want me to beg for my life? If that's what you want, I will. Whatever you ask that is in my power, I will do."
4649,"Do you want me to beg for my life? If that's what you want, I will. Whatever you ask that is in my power, I will do.",What if I want you to die here and now?
4650,What if I want you to die here and now?,Then I will die.
4651,I would do anything to undo what's been done to you. I know that I can't. Will you allow me to say one more thing before I go? Your great-uncle Brynden the Blackfish has gathered what remains of the Tully forces and retaken Riverrun. You might consider seeking him out. The time may come when you need an army loyal to you.,I have an army.
4652,Who was the first?,"He was no one. The Many-Faced God taught him how to shed his face and how to give the gift. The man taught others in exchange for their service. Many served, many more gifts were given. Soon all the masters and overseers were gone and the Faceless Men fled."
4653,Where did they go?,"Here. They founded the Free City of Braavos and built this house. These were the faces they wore in life when they were not wearing others. The first Faceless Men. And now a girl is one of them, if a girl desires."
4654,Who?,"An actress who calls herself Lady Crane. She performs at the theater in Sheelba Square. A girl has been given a second chance. There will not be a third. One way or another, a face will be added to the hall."
4655,"I feel the winds of winter as they lick across the land. And our son alone on that cold, cold throne without a guiding hand. Who will teach him strength? Who will teach him grace? To whom will he turn when it's time to learn to look darkness in the face?",Ned stark will do fine. Now bring me more wine.
4656,"Ooh! Ooh, what's happened here, then?","He brought you here, Ned Stark, ‘cause you're the brightest fellow in the land. You should be king of us all and I should be your Hand."
4657,Will you stay on as Joffrey's Hand?,The Iron Throne's what I demand.
4658,What's that mean?,The proper progression.
4659,I rang very false?,"What you need, love, is for someone to ring you true."
4660,"May I get you some wine, Lady Crane?","I'm a rum girl, Bobono. You need to know that if we're going to be intimate."
4661,Does death only come for the wicked and leave the decent behind?,No. Who wants her dead?
4662,No. Who wants her dead?,That does not matter. The price was paid.
4663,From whom?,From you. From men.
4664,We speak in the presence of the Drowned God. In his name we father today to choose a new king as our leader. Who makes a claim?,"I am Yara Greyjoy, daughter of Balon Greyjoy, King of the Iron Islands. I claim the Salt Throne."
4665,"When did you return, Uncle?",A few days ago. I had some things to take care of. Long overdue.
4666,Gallivanting? That the sort of thing you start to say once your dick gets chopped off?,Did the great lord of Westeros teach you words like that?
4667,Did the great lord of Westeros teach you words like that?,You were gone. Yara was here. Being Ironborn. Leading Ironborn. Getting ready to bring us back to glory.
4668,And how will she do that?,I will build the largest fleet the world has ever seen.
4669,You're going to seduce the Dragon Queen?,I'm not going to seduce her. The Iron Fleet will seduce her. And together we're going to take the Seven Kingdoms. I wasn't born to be king. I paid the iron price and here I stand.
4670,Where are my niece and nephew? Let's go murder them.,They stole our best ships.
4671,Is there a cure?,I don't know.
4672,How long does it take?,I don't know that either. But I've seen what happens when it goes far enough. I'll end things before that.
4673,"In the last fortnight since our pact with the Masters, how many killings have been carried out by the Sons of the Harpy?",None.
4674,"Yes, but do they know who brought them security? Who brought about an end to the violence? We need someone the people trust, someone they know who cannot be bought or influenced.",Sounds like quite the hero. Where would we find him?
4675,Sounds like quite the hero. Where would we find him?,Who said anything about “him”?
4676,Who said anything about “him”?,"You stand in the presence of Kinvara, High Priestess of the Red Temple of Volantis, the Flame of Truth, the Light of Wisdom, the First Servant of the Lord of Light."
4677,"Her dragons are fire made flesh, a gift from the Lord of Light. But you heard all this before, haven't you? On the Long Bridge of Volantis. The dragons will purify nonbelievers by the thousands, burning their sins and flesh away.",Ideally we'd avoid purifying too many nonbelievers. The Mother of Dragons has followers of many different faiths.
4678,I suppose it's hard for a fanatic to admit a mistake. Isn't that the whole point of being a fanatic? You're always right. Everything is the Lordo s will.,Everything is the Lordo s will. But men and women make mistakes. Even honest servants of the Lord.
4679,"And you, an honest servant of the lord, why should I trust you to know any more than the priestess who counseled Stannis?","My friend has a healthy skepticism of religion, but we are all loyal supporters of the queen."
4680,"Everyone is what they are and where they are for a reason. Terrible things happen for a reason. Take what happened to you, Lord Varys, when you were a child. If not for your mutilation at the hand of a second-rate sorcerer, you wouldn't be here helping the Lordo s Chosen bring his light into the world. Knowledge has made you powerful. But there's still so much you don't know. Do you remember what you heard that night when the sorcerer tossed your parts in the fire? You heard a voice call out from the flames. Do you remember? Should I tell you what the voice said?",Should I tell you the name of the one who spoke?
4681,Should I tell you the name of the one who spoke?,"We serve the same queen. If you are her true friend, you have nothing to fear from me."
4682,What?,"He saw me, the Night King! He saw me!"
4683,The time for what?,For you to become me.
4684,But am I ready?,No.
4685,"How well do you know the North, Ser Davos?","Precious little, my lady."
4686,"They may well be loyal, but how many rose up against the Boltons when they betrayed your family? I may not know the North, but I know men. They're more or less the same in any corner of the world and even the bravest of them don't want to see their wives and children skinned for a lost cause. If Jon's going to convince them to fight alongside him, they need to believe it's a fight they can win.","There are more than three other houses in the North -- Glover, Mormont, Cerwyn, Mazin, Hornwood. Two dozen more. Together they equal all the others. We can start small and build."
4687,How do you know that?,Ramsay received a raven before I escaped Winterfell.
4688,What is it?,I don't like leaving you here alone.
4689,With Jon?,"Not him. He seems trustworthy. A bit brooding, perhaps. I suppose that's understandable, considering. The others, though. Davos and the Red Woman helped a man murder his own brother with blood magic. And when Stannis paid for his crime, where were they? Already out looking for a leader with better prospects. And that wildling fellow with the beard --"
4690,"Not him. He seems trustworthy. A bit brooding, perhaps. I suppose that's understandable, considering. The others, though. Davos and the Red Woman helped a man murder his own brother with blood magic. And when Stannis paid for his crime, where were they? Already out looking for a leader with better prospects. And that wildling fellow with the beard --","Jon isn't Tormund. Jon isn't Davos, the Red Woman, or Stannis for that matter. Jon is Jon. He's my brother. He'll keep me safe. I trust him."
4691,Then why did you lie to him when he asked you how you learned about Riverrun?,New dress?
4692,New dress?,I made it myself. Do you like it?
4693,I made it myself. Do you like it?,"Year, it's -- I like the wolf bit."
4694,"Should we close the gate, Lord Commander?",I'm not the Lord Comman --
4695,Eat something that isn't moss. I want an egg. How do you like ‘em? Boiled? Fried up with some butter?,With a rasher of bacon and some blood sausage.
4696,What are you doing?,Go!
4697,Wylis! What's the matter?,Hold the door!
4698,"Yes, now that's very important. If he thinks that Little Sam is his grandchild, he'll take you in. He'll get an education. He'll learn to read. And you can help teach him. Huh?",What did you tell your family about me?
4699,What did you tell your family about me?,I told them I met you in the North.
4700,Did you tell them how far north?,"Well, it wasn't a very large piece of parchment."
4701,You didn't tell them where I'm really from? You didn't tell them I'm a wildling?,"The thing is...my father doesn't like wildlings. He hoped I'd make a man of myself by “killing some bloody wildlings,” so it's probably a good subject to avoid if at all possible."
4702,"Talla? Gods, you're a woman now.",Father says I have to marry Symun Fossoway. He has yellow teeth- -
4703,May I hold him?,"Yes, of course."
4704,Where is Father? And Dickon?,They're on a hunt. They'll join us for dinner. Come inside. Such a journey. You must be exhausted.
4705,"Come, you'll be wanting a bath after all that travel. Oh, and a dress for dinner. You can wear one of mine. What's your color? Midnight blue or silver? Silver, maybe. Come. You can choose one of my bedrooms if you want.",Is there no other way?
4706,Is there no other way?,You're afraid for her?
4707,You're afraid for her?,Of course I'm afraid for her! It just seems very dangerous.
4708,And now she's devoted to the gods as well. Would you like to see her?,Have they hurt you? Have they mistreated you?
4709,Have they hurt you? Have they mistreated you?,"No, Your Grace."
4710,Better how? Soon the- - walk of atonement. He says there's no other way.,"Have you spoken to him at all, the High Sparrow?"
4711,"Have you spoken to him at all, the High Sparrow?","Yes, a few times. Have you?"
4712,"Yes, a few times. Have you?","Yes, I have. He's not quite what we thought he was, is he?"
4713,"Yes, I have. He's not quite what we thought he was, is he?",You think I'm mad. I sound mad.
4714,What are you talking about? You're a good person. You've always been a good person. You're the best person I know.,I was just telling him about your devotion to the poor.
4715,What about Loras?,"I love my brother. I will always love my brother. His soul is pure and perfect. His sins don't erase that purity, they only obscure it. He just needs to atone for them. We all do. Sooner or later, one way or another. The gods have a plan for us all."
4716,"This venison, it's very tasty. Is it from today's hunt?","Well, no. We haven't been able to cure that one yet. This is last week's."
4717,So do you do much hunting up at the wall?,"Oh, yes. Yes. A good amount. North of the Wall, you don't hunt, you don't eat."
4718,Mm-hmmm. Mostly deer or is it elk as well?,"Rabbits. Sometimes squirrels. I say “we,” it's my friend Jon mostly. Sometimes Edd. Oh, and Gilly. She's- - she's quite a good hunter as well. Um, huntress."
4719,Your father taught you to hunt? Our father would never teach us. I think our father could learn a thing or two from your father.,That's enough of that.
4720,"Samwell, would you care for more bread?","Oh, yes. Yes, please. Thank you, Mother."
4721,Not fat enough already?,I travelled south under orders from the Lord Commander. He wants me to- -
4722,Your way down to Castle Black? Where did he kill a white walker? Where are you from? How'd you come to meet my son?,The Night's Watch came to our keep.
4723,Where?,Gilly.
4724,North of the Wall? You're a Wildling. The Seven Kingdoms have waged war against these savages for centuries and here I sit hosting one in my hall thanks to my son. See that sword?,"It's called Heartsbane. It's been in our family for 500 years. It's Valyrian steel. Only a handful of them left in the world. It's supposed to go to my firstborn son after I die. To him. He will never wield that sword. If he were to become Lord Tarly of Horn Hill, it would be the end of this house. I took you for a Mole's Town whore when I saw you and I made my peace with that. Who else would have him? But I overestimated him. No. It was a wildling whore that seduced my son. This you getting back at me, boy? Hmm? Bring that to my table and making me dine with it. And you got what you were after, didn't you? A bastard. A half-breed bastard. Your invitation into our home."

4726,I'm not angry at you. I'm angry that horrible people can treat good people that way and get away with it. When do you have to go?,First light.
4727,Sam?,We're leaving.
4728,What?,Get your things.
4729,What are you doing?,We belong together. All of us.
4730,What about your mother and sister?,"Oh, they'll understand."
4731,Sam. Won't he come for it?,He can bloody well try.
4732,"I'll drink a toast to my new queen, for there is no one fairer. Dear Uncle, will you share my joy and be my royal cupbearer?","Drink long and deep, my noble king, from this cup of sweet wine."
4733,What is that I hear and smell? Someone I'll soon send to hell.,It's time to see if truth they told who said Tywin Lannister shits gold.
4734,What are you doing back here?,Nothing.
4735,I saw you the other day in the audience. How many times have you seen this stupid play?,Three times.
4736,Did you pay?,No.
4737,How would you change it?,The queen loves her son more than anything. And he was taken from her before she could say good-bye. She wouldn't just cry. She would be angry. She would want to kill the person who did this to her.
4738,What's your name?,Mercy.
4739,Wonderful eyebrows. Do you like pretending to be other people?,I have to go. My father's waiting for me.
4740,With what you're given?,"Well, I was thinking- -"
4741,"Oh, we're all thinkers now, are we?",Full to the tits with ideas.
4742,"You have ideas, I have ideas, he has ideas. Why should my ideas have any more value than yours simply because I've been doing this my whole life? Who is anyone to judge my work? This is my profession. I know what I'm doing.",You have no right to an opinion.
4743,And?,As I expected.
4744,What's happening?,He's beaten us. That's what's happening.
4745,Will I be walking naked in the streets? Or will I spend a few months in the sept dungeons first to teach me about the gods' mercy?,You have served your house and your king faithfully for many years. And you will continue to do so. But not in this city.
4746,You've lost it?,"Yes, father."
4747,"What, then?",I'm going to give Bronn the largest bag of gold anyone's ever seen and have him gather the best killers he knows. I'll take them to the sept and I'll remove the High Sparrow's head and every other sparrow head I can find.
4748,He has our son! He stole our son! He's torn our family apart. How should we treat people who tear us apart?,"We should treat them without mercy and we will. But if you kill the High Sparrow, you won't leave the sept alive. And without you, this is all for nothing. Stand at the head of our army where you belong, where Father wanted you. Show our men where their loyalties belong. Show them what lannisters are, what we do to our enemies. And take that stupid little castle back because it's ours and because you can."
4749,Why did you help us?,The Three-Eyed Raven sent for me.
4750,Who are you?,Uncle Benjen. The last letter Jon wrote me said you had been lost beyond the Wall.
4751,How?,The same way they made the Walkers in the first place. You saw it yourself.
4752,Everything all right?,How many days' ride to Meereen?
4753,How many days' ride to Meereen?,A week at best.
4754,How many ships will I need to bring my khalasar to Westeros?,"Dothraki and all their horses, the Unsullied, the Second Sons- - 1,000 ships easily. Probably more."
4755,And who has that many?,Nobody.
4756,So we ride for Meereen and after that we sail for Westeros. What then?,I take what is mine.
4757,What was I made for?,"You're a conqueror, Daenerys Stormborn."
4758,I will ask more of you than any khal has ever asked of his khalassar! Will you ride the wooden horses across the black salt sea?,Will you kill my enemies in their iron suits and tear down their stone houses?
4759,Will you kill my enemies in their iron suits and tear down their stone houses?,"Will you give me the Seven Kingdoms, the gift Khal Drogo promised me before the Mother of Mountains?"
4760,"Will you give me the Seven Kingdoms, the gift Khal Drogo promised me before the Mother of Mountains?",Are you with me?
4761,Are you with me?,Now and always?
4762,Now and always?,That's it. Get it to the top.
4763,"Hey, come on. Put your back into it, huh?","Here you are, son."
4764,In all my days I've never seen a man swing an ax like that. How many men did it take to cut you down?,Just one.
4765,"I was gonna give you a proper burial and then you coughed. Oh, nearly shit myself. I reckoned you were gonna die by the time I loaded you on the wagon, but you didn't. Now, I reckoned you'd die a dozen more times over the next few days, but you didn't. What kept you going?",Hate.
4766,If the gods are real...why haven't they punished me?,They have.
4767,Your Grace. What are we reading today?,"The Book of the Mother, Your Holiness. Chapter three, verse 12."
4768,Can I ask you about a personal matter?,Of course.
4769,My grandmother?,"Yes. The Queen of Thorns is a remarkable woman, a strong woman, and an unrepentant sinner. You must teach her the new way as she taught you the old. Or I fear for her safety, body and soul."
4770,Does it move or talk? I want to speak with you alone.,Septa Unella has been my true friend and counselor.
4771,What have they done to you?,"You marched against the High Sparrow, against the Faith."
4772,And what about your brother? What mercy did they show him?,"Loras's only hope is to confess his crimes and repent. If he does, the Faith will allow him to return to Highgarden. He'll have to renounce his name and title..."
4773,Have you lost your mind?,and live his life as a penitent.
4774,Shall we pray?,"We said we'd fight with you, King Crow, when the time comes and we meant it, but this isn't what we agreed to. These aren't White Walkers. This isn't an army of the dead. This isn't our find."
4775,"Remember Mance's camp? It stretched all the way to the horizon. And look at us now. Look what's left of us. And if we lose this, we're gone. Dozens of tribes, hundreds of generations. Be like we were never there at all. We'll be the last of the free folk.","That's what'll happen to you if we lose. The Boltons, the Karstarks, the Umbers, they know you're here. They know that more than half of you are women and children. After they finish with me, they'll come for you. You're right. This isn't your fight. You shouldn't have to come to Winterfell with me. I shouldn't be asking you. It's not the deal we made. I need you with me if we're gonna beat them, and we need to beat them if you're going to survive."
4776,Are you sure they'll come?,"We're not clever like you southerners. When we say we'll do something, we do it."
4777,Your grandson is still a prisoner. You'll leave him rotting in a cell?,Loras rots in a cell because of you. THe High Sparrow rules this city because of you. Our two ancient houses face collapse because of you and your stupidity.
4778,"I wonder if you're the worst person I've ever met. At a certain age, it's hard to recall. But the truly vile do stand out through the years. Do you remember the way you smirked at me when my grandson and granddaughter were dragged off to their cells? I do. I'll never forget it.",You love your granddaughter. I love my son. It's the only truth I know. We must defend them.
4779,"What'll you do, then? You have no support. Not anymore. Your brother's gone. The High Sparrow saw to that. The rest of your family have abandoned you. The people despise you. You're surrounded by enemies, thousands of them. You're going to kill them all by yourself? You've lost, Cersei. It's the only joy I can find in all this misery.",Pick the pace up. Keep going.
4780,"You think I won't do it, old man?",I sliced your niece's throat from ear to ear. And where were you? Running and hiding like a fucking coward. Yield the castle or I cut his throat.
4781,I sliced your niece's throat from ear to ear. And where were you? Running and hiding like a fucking coward. Yield the castle or I cut his throat.,"Go on, then. Cut his throat."
4782,"Lothar, is it?",Ser Jaime. We didn't know you were coming.
4783,"Only a fool makes threats he's not prepared to carry out. Now let's say I threatened to hit you unless you shut your mouth, but you kept talking. What do you think I'd do?",I don't give a rat's- -
4784,A parley or a fight?,He's an old man.
4785,I think we've had enough small talk. What are you here?,Stannis Baratheon garrisoned at Castle Black before he marched on Winterfell and was killed. He showed me the letter you wrote to him when he petitioned for men. It said- -
4786,"As far as I understand, you're a Snow and Lady Sansa is a Bolton. Or is she a Lannister? I've heard conflicting reports.","I did what I had to do to survive, my lady. But I am a Stark. I will always be a Stark."
4787,I understand that I'm responsible for Bear Island and all who live here. So why should I sacrifice one more Mormont life for someone else's war?,"If it please, my lady, I understand how you feel."
4788,"I don't know you, Ser…?","Davos, my lady, of House Seaworth."
4789,"All right, Ser Davos of House Seaworth. How is it you understand how I feel?","You never thought you'd find yourself in your position. Being responsible for so many lives at such a young age. I never thought I'd be in my position. I was a crabber's son, then I was a smuggler. And now I found myself addressing the lady of a great house in time of war. But I'm here because this isn't someone else's war. It's our war."
4790,Is this true?,Your uncle fought them at the Fist of the First Men. I fought them at Hardhome. We both lost.
4791,"Thank you, my lady. How many fighting men can we expect?",62.
4792,62?,"We are not a large house, but we're a proud one. And every man from Bear Island fights with the strength of 10 mainlanders."
4793,Pity. Do you wish to resume your captivity?,Then why are you here?
4794,Then why are you here?,"You know why I'm here. This castle belongs to House Frey. You're trespassing. In the name of King Tommen, I order you to surrender or- -"
4795,Or you'll kill Edmure?,My nephew's marked for death no matter what. Hang him and be done with it.
4796,Your honor? Bargaining with oathbreakers is like building on quicksand.,"The war is over, ser. Why sacrifice living men to a lost cause?"
4797,"The war is over, ser. Why sacrifice living men to a lost cause?","As long as I'm standing, the war is not over. This is my home. I was born in this castle and I'm ready to die in it. So you can either attack or try to starve us out. We have enough provisions for two years. Do you have two years, Kingslayer?"
4798,"As long as I'm standing, the war is not over. This is my home. I was born in this castle and I'm ready to die in it. So you can either attack or try to starve us out. We have enough provisions for two years. Do you have two years, Kingslayer?",You clearly have no intention of saving your men's lives. Why did you come to treat with me?
4799,You clearly have no intention of saving your men's lives. Why did you come to treat with me?,"Sieges are dull. And I wanted to see you in person, get the measure of you."
4800,I've heard enough. We've only just taken back this castle from the Ironborn. The Boltons helped us do it. Now you want me to fight against them? I could be skinned for even talking to you.,The Boltons are traitors. Roose Bolton- -
4801,Have other northern houses pledged to fight for you?,House Mormont.
4802,And?,We sent raven to Houses Manderly- -
4803,I don't care about ravens. You're asking me to join your army. Who is fighting in this army?,The bulk of the force is made up of wildlings.
4804,And where was King Robb when the Ironborn attacked this castle? When they threw my wife and children in prison and brutalized and killed our subjects? Taking up with a foreign whore. Getting himself and those who followed him killed.,"I served House Stark once, but House Stark is dead."
4805,Why did we have to come here?,Some of us still like it. Have a drink at least.
4806,Nothing on the Iron Islands has an ass like that. Doesn't interest you anymore?,"I'm sorry. I won't joke about it. I'll never hurt you, little brother. Don't you know that?"
4807,"I'm sorry. I won't joke about it. I'll never hurt you, little brother. Don't you know that?",You think Uncle Euron's hunting for us?
4808,You think Uncle Euron's hunting for us?,"Of course he is. As long as we're alive, we're a threat."
4809,Some bad years?,But I'm tired of watching you cower like a beat dog. Drink the goddamn ale.
4810,"Now listen to me. I need you. The real Theon Greyjoy, not this rat shit pretender. Can you find him for me? Drink.","You escaped, do you hear me? You got away and you're never going back. We'll get justice for you."
4811,"You escaped, do you hear me? You got away and you're never going back. We'll get justice for you.","If I got justice, my burnt body would hang over the gates of Winterfell."
4812,Are you with me? Are you really with me?,"Now, since it's my last night ashore for a long while, I'm gonna go fuck the tits off this one."
4813,And that's a good thing?,He was the most experienced commander in Westeros. He chose this place for a reason. Those mountains are a natural fortification. There's a stream down there for the horses.
4814,So he's your most trusted advisor now? Because he secured 62 men from a ten year old?,Ser Davos is the reason I'm standing here talking to you and he served Stannis for years.
4815,"Stannis who lost the Blackwater, who murdered his own brother, who doesn't have a head?",It's not enough. We need more men.
4816,Who the fuck are you?,Hold on.
4817,"Yeah, who the fuck are you?","I was a soldier once. All my superiors thought I was brave. I wasn't. I mean, I never ran from a fight. Only because I was afraid my friends would see I was afraid. That's all I was, a coward. We followed orders no matter the orders. Burn that village. Fine, I'm your arsonist. Steal that farmer's crops. Good, I'm your thief. Kill those young lads so they won't take up arms against us. I'm your murderer. I remember once a woman screaming at us, calling us animals as we dragged her son from their hut. But we weren't animals. Animals are true to their nature and we had betrayed ours. I cut that young boy's throat myself as his mother screamed and my friends held her back."
4818,"Now, I know I can never bring that lad back. All I can do with time I've got left is bring a little goodness into the world. That's all any of us can do, isn't it? Never too late to stop robbing people, to stop killing people. Start helping people.",It's never too late to come back.
4819,"Seven save you, friends. How can we help you?",What are you doing here?
4820,What are you doing here?,"Well, we're talking about life. You?"
4821,"Well, we're talking about life. You?",Protecting the people.
4822,"Well, we thank you for your protection. Who are you protecting us from?",Do you have any horses?
4823,Do you have any horses?,No horses. No gold. No steel.
4824,I'm a fucking septon. What was I supposed to say?,They don't believe in your Seven. They're from the Brotherhood. They follow the Red God.
4825,What do you want to do? Fight them? Kill them?,"It'd be you against all of them. I mean, these people don't know how to fight."
4826,Even if it's to protect yourself?,Violence is a disease. You don't cure a disease by spreading it to more people.
4827,What do you care?,I want to book passage home.
4828,You? Can't afford it.,Where'd you steal this from?
4829,Where'd you steal this from?,Why do you care?
4830,Why do you care?,We leave in two days. You can have a hammock in steerage.
4831,You're good at that. Where did you learn?,I'm a jealous woman. I've always liked bad men and they've always liked me. They'd come home wherever home was that night stinking of some whore's perfume.
4832,What happened to the actress? The one who wanted you dead.,Bianca.
4833,"Why not? Got a feeling you'd be good at this sort of work. And besides, we need a new actress.",I don't think I could remember all of the lines.
4834,Come with us. What's left for you here?,You wouldn't be safe. Not while she's looking for me.
4835,Who?,She doesn't have a name.
4836,Where will you go?,Essos is east and Westeros is west. But what's west of Westeros?
4837,Essos is east and Westeros is west. But what's west of Westeros?,I don't know.
4838,What's that?,Milk of the poppy.
4839,I was a famous kisser. You lads know how to kiss proper?,Course we do.
4840,"Look at him. You get hard, boy?",Fuck you! Disgusting old twats.
4841,"Got off on that, did you, you old fuck?",Where's the other one? The one with the yellow cloak.
4842,Where's the other one? The one with the yellow cloak.,Fuck you!
4843,"Those are your last words, fuck you? Come on, you can do better.",Cunt!
4844,"You're shit at dying, you know that?","From the fire she was reborn to remake the world. Daenerys is a gift from the Lord of Light to her children. If we are steadfast in our love for the Queen and her faithful advisors, no man will ever lock us in chains again."
4845,Would you?,Look around. The city has come back to life.
4846,Have been permitted? That's rather a tortured way of putting it.,"They demand to see you, Your Grace."
4847,Who permitted them inside the Red Keep?,The king is aware of their presence?
4848,The king is aware of their presence?,"He is, Your Grace. He's currently in his chambers at prayer."
4849,The High Septon commands you. Are you sure you want to refuse him?,He promised me I could stay in the Red Keep until my trial.
4850,Who goes there? State your business!,My name is Brienne of Tarth. Please inform Ser Jaime Lannister I've come to speak with him. Tell him I have his sword.
4851,"Getting a bit old to be a squire, aren't we?",Podrick fucking Payne. I thought you'd be dead by now.
4852,Are they in there?,Mm-hmm.
4853,You think they're fucking?,What? No.
4854,What? No.,"Why not? I'd fuck her. You'd fuck her, wouldn't you?"
4855,"Why not? I'd fuck her. You'd fuck her, wouldn't you?",I'm her squire.
4856,"Oh. Well, he'd fuck her, that's for sure. And she's fuck him, don't you think? The way she looks at him. The way all women look at him is frankly irritating. I preferred working with the little brother on that account. Come on, you're the one with the magic cock.",You must have shown it to her by now.
4857,Is she? Oh.,"An hour in the morning, and hour at night. Every day."
4858,Then how come an old cunt like me can still sneak up and murder you?,"Well, that's a different sort of fighting."
4859,"Now, that's the truth, isn't it? You want to learn that sort of fighting?","All right, let's start with your footwork."
4860,"Now, listen to me, Pod. See how your feet are about a yard apart?","Lesson number one, assume everyone wants to hit you. ‘Cause they do, Pod. Everyone wants to hit a fucking squire. Do it again. Come on, don't sulk."
4861,Why would you assume that?,"In my experience, girls like her don't live very long."
4862,"Of course my sister wants Sansa dead. The girl is still a suspect in Joffrey's murder, so there is that complication. What the hell are you doing here?",I've come for the Blackfish.
4863,With what army does she plan on taking Winterfell?,The Tully army.
4864,The Tullys are rebels because they're fighting for their home?,Riverrun was granted to the Freys by royal decree.
4865,What do you propose?,Allow me to enter Riverrun under a flag of truce. Let me try to persuade the Blackfish to give up the castle.
4866,Why would he abandon his ancestral home?,Because you'll allow him to lead the Tully forces safely north.
4867,Have you ever met the Blackfish?,No.
4868,"Yes, Lady Brienne?","Should I fail to persuade the Blackfish to surrender, and if you attack the castle, honor compels me to fight for Sansa's kin."
4869,No?,Who gave you permission to cross the siege line and enter the castle? Who gave you that sword with the gold lion on the pommel?
4870,Who gave you permission to cross the siege line and enter the castle? Who gave you that sword with the gold lion on the pommel?,"Ser Jaime kept his word to your niece Catelyn Stark. He sent me to find Sansa, to help her as Catelyn wanted. He gave me this sword to protect her. That is what I have done and I will continue to do until the day I die."
4871,What should I write?,Tell her I failed.
4872,There's to be a royal announcement?,There is.
4873,Why wasn't I informed?,There is to be a royal announcement in the throne room at this very moment.
4874,Where are you going?,To stand by my son.
4875,And? Was it just a rumor or something more?,More. Much more.
4876,Why don't you drink? Why don't either of you ever drink?,Unsullied never drink.
4877,Why not?,Rules.
4878,And who made these rules? Your former masters?,Those miserable old shits didn't want you to be human. Have a drink with me.
4879,And you? What's your excuse?,I have tried wine before. It made me feel funny.
4880,Do you like it?,Tastes like it has turned.
4881,Grey worm?,"Right. Three lords walk into a tavern- - a Stark, a Martell, and a Lannister. They order ale..."
4882,"Missandei, do you like the wine?",I do.
4883,"The first says, “Do you know how to swim?” The second says, “No, but I can shout for help in 19 languages.”",Ah!
4884,I am soldier all my life. You think I never hear joke?,You lied to us.
4885,I have your word?,"Oh, good. Good, that's- - that's a fine thing. My uncle will never surrender the castle, ser. Whatever game you're playing."
4886,"You should be with them both. I can arrange that, you realize? Comfortable rooms for you at Casterly Rock. A tutor for your boy, knights to train him to fight and to ride. And when he comes of age, he'll have a keep of his own.",Do you imagine yourself a decent person? Is that it? After you've massacred my family. Kept me in a cell for years. Stolen our lands.
4887,Do you imagine yourself a decent person? Is that it? After you've massacred my family. Kept me in a cell for years. Stolen our lands.,"I'll remind you that our houses are at war. I'm sorry if this conflict has inconvenienced you, but rebelling against the Crown does have consequences."
4888,Did I give you the impression that this was a negotiation? It's not.,You understand. On some level you understand that you're an evil man.
4889,"Well, that is convenient for you. You're a fine-looking fellow, aren't you?","Your square jaw, your golden armor. Tell me, I want to know. I truly do. How do you live with yourself? All of us have to believe that we're decent, don't we? You have to sleep at night. How do you tell yourself that you're decent after everything that you've done?"
4890,"Your square jaw, your golden armor. Tell me, I want to know. I truly do. How do you live with yourself? All of us have to believe that we're decent, don't we? You have to sleep at night. How do you tell yourself that you're decent after everything that you've done?",I was your sister's prisoner once. She hit me on the head with a rock if I remember correctly.
4891,Do you think I care whom you admire and whom you don't?,"No, I don't, but I'm telling you anyway because you're my prisoner. You don't have a choice. The love she had for her children, I was a little awed by it. Reminded me of my sister."
4892,Who goes there?,"Edmure Tully, son of Hoster Tully, and the rightful Lord of Riverrun. I demand entry."
4893,"He's been their captive ever since they murdered his king at the Red Wedding. Why do you think the people who murdered his king at the Red Wedding would decide to let him come home? Because it's a trap, you idiot. Don't let him in.","He's my lord, my lord. I've sworn to serve the Lord of Riverrun and obey his commands."
4894,"All right, what should the army do?","We'll not go to the beach. If we go to the beach, the Masters will take the pyramid. The pyramid is the only place in the city we can defend. We stay here."
4895,And then?,We wait for them to come to us. Then we fight them.
4896,What the fuck you doing here?,Chasing them. You?
4897,Chasing them. You?,Hanging them.
4898,Any particular reason?,They're our men. Or they were. They attacked a nearby sept and murdered the villagers. Why do you want them?
4899,They're our men. Or they were. They attacked a nearby sept and murdered the villagers. Why do you want them?,Same reason. I was helping build it. They killed a friend of mine.
4900,You've got friends?,Not anymore. They're mine.
4901,hanging? All over in an instant. Where's the punishment in that?,They die.
4902,Got anything to eat?,Enjoying yourself?
4903,Enjoying yourself?,I prefer chicken.
4904,And you're going to go stop them?,We need good men to help us.
4905,True enough. But the Lord of Light gave you the power to defeat me. Why?,"I beat you because I'm better than you, Beric. I was better than you before you started yammering on about the Lord and I'm better than you now."
4906,"Aye, you're probably right. You're a fighter. You were born a fighter. You walked away from the fight. How did that go? Good and bad, young and old, the things we're fighting will destroy them all alike. You can still help a lot more than you've harmed Clegane, it's not too late for you.",Lady Crane?
4907,Lady Crane?,"If you'd have done your job, she would have died painlessly."
4908,It will all be over soon. On your knees or on your feet?,Haven't we been through this already? That won't help you.
4909,Haven't we been through this already? That won't help you.,You told her to kill me.
4910,The city is on the rise?,Meereen is strong. Commerce has returned to the markets. The people are behind you.
4911,Good. Shall we begin?,Do we have a plan?
4912,Do we have a plan?,"I will crucify the Masters. I will set their fleets afire, kill every last one of their soldiers, and return their cities to the dirt. That is my plan."
4913,You don't approve?,You once told me you knew what your father was. Did you know his plans for King's Landing when the Lannister armies were at his gates?
4914,You once told me you knew what your father was. Did you know his plans for King's Landing when the Lannister armies were at his gates?,"Probably not. Well, he told my brother and Jaime told me. He had caches of wildfire hidden under the Red Keep, the Guildhalls, the Sept of Baelor, all the major thoroughfares. He would have burned every one of his citizens. The loyal ones and the trators. Every man, woman, and child. That's why Jaime killed him."
4915,"It always seems a bit abstract, doesn't it, other people dying?",Him. He should die.
4916,"Thank you for returning Lady Bolton safely. Now, dismount and kneel before me, surrender your army and proclaim me the true Lord of Winterfell and Warden of the North. I will pardon you for deserting the Night's Watch. I will pardon these treasonous lords for betraying my house. Come, bastard, you don't have the men, you don't have the horses, and you don't have Winterfell. Why lead those pour souls into slaughter? There's no need for a battle. Get off your hose and kneel. I'm a man of mercy.",You're right. There's no need for a battle. Thousands of men don't need to die. Only one of us. Let's end this the old way. You against me.
4917,"I keep hearing stories about you, bastard. The way people in the North talk about you, you're the greatest swordsman who ever walked. Maybe you are that good. Maybe not. I don't know if I'd beat you. But I know that my army will beat yours. I have 6,000 men. You have, what, half that? Not even?","Aye, you have the numbers. Will your men want to fight for you when they hear you wouldn't fight for them?"
4918,"Aye, you have the numbers. Will your men want to fight for you when they hear you wouldn't fight for them?","He's good. Very good. Tell me, will you let your little brother die because you're too proud to surrender?"
4919,"He's good. Very good. Tell me, will you let your little brother die because you're too proud to surrender?",How do we know you have him?
4920,How do we know you have him?,"Now, if you want to save —"
4921,"She's a fine woman, your sister. I look forward to having her back in my bed. And you're all fine-looking men. My dogs are desperate to meet you. I haven't fed them for seven days. They're ravenous. I wonder which parts they'll try first. Your eyes? Your balls? We'll find out soon enough. In the morning, then, bastard.","If he was smart, he'd stay inside the walls of Winterfell and wait us out."
4922,Did you really think that cunt would fight you man to man?,No. But I wanted to make him angry. I want him coming at us full tilt.
4923,"You've known him for the space of a single conversation, you and your trusted advisors, and you sit around and make your plans on how to defeat a man you don't know. I lived with him. I know the way his mind works. I know how he likes to hurt people. Did it ever once occur to you that I might have some insight?",You're right.
4924,"Aye, and what have I been doing all my life? Playing with broomsticks? I fought beyond the Wall against worse than Ramsay Bolton. I've defended the Wall from worse than Ramsay Bolton.",You don't know him.
4925,"All right, tell me. What should we do? How do we get Rickon back?","We'll never get him back. Rickon is Ned Starks trueborn son, which makes him a greater threat to Ramsay than you, a bastard, or me, a girl. As long as he lives, Ramsay's claim to Winterfell will be contested, which means he won't live long."
4926,Of course he does. What should I do differently?,I don't know! I don't know anything about battles! Just don't do what he wants you to do.
4927,You think that's obvious?,"Well, it is a bit obvious."
4928,"If you had asked for my advice earlier, I would have told you not to attack Winterfell until we have a larger force, or is that obvious, too?",When will we have a larger force?! We've pleaded with every house that'll have us! The Blackfish can't help us! We're lucky to have this many men!
4929,When will we have a larger force?! We've pleaded with every house that'll have us! The Blackfish can't help us! We're lucky to have this many men!,It's not enough!
4930,"If Ramsay wins, I'm not going back there alive. Do you understand me?","SNOW I won't ever let him touch you again. I'll protect you, I promise."
4931,You think there's hope?,"I've never seen these Bolton fuckers fight. And they've never seen the free folk fight, so, yes, there's hope. You want to avenge your king, don't you?"
4932,"I've never seen these Bolton fuckers fight. And they've never seen the free folk fight, so, yes, there's hope. You want to avenge your king, don't you?",It wasn't the Boltons defeated Stannis. It was Stannis himself. I loved the man. He lifted me up and made me something. But he had demons in his skull whispering foul things.
4933,You saw these demons?,What?
4934,What?,"No, it's a manner of speaking. Not actual demons."
4935,I need a good drink to help me sleep the night before a fight. You want some? I have a jug of sour goat's milk stronger than any of that grape water you southern twats like sucking on.,"No, thanks. It does sound delicious, but I better keep a clear head. I can never sleep the night before a battle."
4936,So what do you do all night?,I walk. Think and walk. Think and walk until I'm far enough away from camp that no one can hear me shitting my guts out.
4937,Any advice?,Don't lose.
4938,How do you know what he commands?,"I interpret his signs as well as I can. If the Lord didn't want me to bring you back, how did I bring you back? I have no power. Only what he gives me and he gave me you."
4939,"I interpret his signs as well as I can. If the Lord didn't want me to bring you back, how did I bring you back? I have no power. Only what he gives me and he gave me you.",Why?
4940,Why?,I don't know. Maybe you're only needed for this small part of his plan and nothing else. Maybe he brought you here to die again.
4941,What kind of god would do something like that?,The one we've got.
4942,"Last time we saw each other was at Winterfell, yes? You were making jokes about my height, I seem to recall. Everyone who makes a joke about a dwarf's height thinks he's the only person ever to make a joke about a dwarf's height. “The height of nobility,” “a man of your stature,” “someone to look up to.” You're all making the same five or six jokes.",It was a long time ago.
4943,"It was. And how have things been going for you since then? Not so well, I gather. Can't imagine you would have murdered the Stark boys if things had been going well.",I didn't murder the Stark boys. But I did things that were just as bad or worse.
4944,"Doesn't seem like it. He's still alive. It was complicated for you, I'm sure, growing up at Winterfell. Never quite knowing who you were. But then, we all live complicated lives, don't we?","You've brought us 100 ships from the Iron Fleet with men to sail them. In return, I expect you want me to support your claim to the throne of the Iron Islands?"
4945,"You've brought us 100 ships from the Iron Fleet with men to sail them. In return, I expect you want me to support your claim to the throne of the Iron Islands?",Not my claim. Hers.
4946,And what's wrong with you?,I'm not fit to rule.
4947,Has the Iron Islands ever had a queen before?,No more than Westeros.
4948,Will their ships be enough?,"With the former Masters' fleet, possibly. Barely. There are more than 100 ships in the Iron Fleet."
4949,So why shouldn't I wait for him?,The Iron Fleet isn't all he's bringing. He also wants to give you --
4950,And I imagine your offer is free of any marriage demands?,"I never demand, but I'm up for anything, really."
4951,And you don't want the Seven Kingdoms?,Your ancestors defeated ours and took the Iron Islands. We ask you to give them back.
4952,And that's all?,We'd like you to help us murder an uncle or two who don't think a woman's fit to rule.
4953,What if everyone starts demanding their independence?,"She's not demanding, she's asking. The others are free to ask as well. Our father were evil men, all of us here. They left the world worse than they found it. We're not going to do that. We're going to leave the world better than we found it."
4954,"Do you like games, little man? Let's play a game. Run to your brother. The sooner you make it to him, the sooner you get to see him. That's it. That's the game. Easy. Ready? Go.","No, you have to run, remember? Those are the rules."
4955,"No, you have to run, remember? Those are the rules.",Don't.
4956,Who owns the North?,We do!
4957,"You suggested one on one combat, didn't you?",I've reconsidered. I think that sounds like a wonderful idea.
4958,Where is he?,"Ah. Sansa. Hello, Sansa. Is this where I'll be staying now? No. Our time together is about to come to an end. That's all right. You can't kill me. I'm part of you now."
4959,"Ah. Sansa. Hello, Sansa. Is this where I'll be staying now? No. Our time together is about to come to an end. That's all right. You can't kill me. I'm part of you now.",Your words will disappear. Your house will disappear. Your name will disappear. All memory of you will disappear.
4960,You got my money?,Later. Go away.
4961,Ser Loras Tyrell. Are you prepared to stand trial and profess your guilt or innocence before the Seven?,There'll be no need for a trial. I confess before the Seven and freely admit to my crimes.
4962,To which crimes will you be confessing?,All of them. I lay with other men including the traitor Renly Baratheon.
4963,You understand fully what this means?,I do. I will abandon the Tyrell name and all that goes with it. I will renounce my lordship and my claims on Highgarden. I will never marry and I will never father children.
4964,Will you fight to defend your faith against heretics and apostates?,I will.
4965,And where is the queen mother?,Her litter never left the Red Keep.
4966,Where's the king?,"Elsewhere, I'm afraid."
4967,What's the meaning of this? I was told that-- I have more important things to do with my time than waste them in the presence--,"Please, Grand Maester. I bear you no ill will. Please forgive me if you can."
4968,What are you doing?,There's something wrong.
4969,Cersei is not here. Tommen is not here. Why do you think they are not here?,"If the accused is not here, she will be tried regardless. We cannot escape the justice of the gods--"
4970,I said my face would be the last thing you saw before you died. Do you remember?,Good. I'm glad to see your face. I'm ready to meet the gods.
4971,What? Now? Today? You're not going to die today. You're not going to die for quite a while. Ser Gregor.,"This is Ser Gregor Clegane. He's quiet, too."
4972,"You don't even have to do anything, do you?","You just sit there, a rich slab of beef, and all the birds come pecking."
4973,Not blonde enough?,"Ladies, have you met Ser Bronn of the Blackwater, hero of the Battle of Blackwater Bay."
4974,"So the famous Blackfish killed by footsoldiers, eh? Legendary warrior, everyone said.","Have you done much fighting yourself, Lord Frey?"
4975,"Have you done much fighting yourself, Lord Frey?",I'm a bit old for all that.
4976,"The purpose of fighting is defeating your enemies, isn't it?",I've defeated mine. Riverrun belonged to House Tully for a thousand years. Now it's mine. What do you call that? Victory.
4977,I've defeated mine. Riverrun belonged to House Tully for a thousand years. Now it's mine. What do you call that? Victory.,"Yes, you're a great conqueror."
4978,"Go on, mock me, boy. You think I mind? The Tullys mocked me for years. The Starks mocked me. Where are they now? You talk about war as if you're an expert but the one battle I remember you fighting, you were captured by Robb Stark, the Young Wolf. But it doesn't matter. Here we are now, two kingslayers. We know what it's like to have them grovel to our faces and snigger behind our backs. We don't mind, do we? Fear is a marvelous thing.","They don't fear the Freys, though. They fear the Lannisters. We gave you the Riverlands to hold the Riverlands. If we have to ride north and take them back for you every time you lose them, why do we need you?"
4979,"They don't fear the Freys, though. They fear the Lannisters. We gave you the Riverlands to hold the Riverlands. If we have to ride north and take them back for you every time you lose them, why do we need you?",Show me.
4980,"What are your thoughts concerning the king's funeral? As the Sept of Baelor is no longer an option, perhaps a ceremony in the throne room?","He should be with his grandfather, his brother, his sister. Burn him and bury his ashes where the sept once stood."
4981,What is that?,Tell him. Tell him who it belonged to.
4982,Why?,The army was trapped. The horses were dying. It was the only way.
4983,"The only way for what? They all died anyway! You told everyone Stannis was the one. You had him believing it, all of them fooled. And you lied.",I didn't lie. I was wrong.
4984,"Aye, you were wrong. How many died because you were wrong?",I ask your leave to execute this woman for murder. She admits to the crime.
4985,Do you have anything to say for yourself?,"I've been ready to die for many years. If the Lord was done with me, so be it, but he's not. You've seen the Night King, Jon Snow. You know the great war is still to come. You know the army of the dead will be upon us soon. And you know I can help you win that war."
4986,Mother and Father's room? You should take it.,I'm not a Stark.
4987,And you trust him?,"Only a fool would trust Littlefinger. I should have told you about him, about the Knights of the Vale. I'm sorry."
4988,"Well, Father always promised, didn't he?","The last time a Tyrell came to Dorne, he was assassinated. 100 red scorpions, was it?"
4989,"The last time a Tyrell came to Dorne, he was assassinated. 100 red scorpions, was it?","You have nothing to fear from us, Lady Olenna."
4990,"You murder your own prince, but you expect me to trust you?",We invited you to Dorne because we needed your help. You came to Dorne because you needed our help?
4991,We invited you to Dorne because we needed your help. You came to Dorne because you needed our help?,What is your name again? Barbaro?
4992,What is your name again? Barbaro?,Obara.
4993,Anything from you?,No? Good. Let the grown women speak.
4994,No? Good. Let the grown women speak.,The Lannisters have declared war on House Tyrell. They have declared war on Dorne. We must be allies now if we wish to survive.
4995,And what is my heart's desire?,Vengeance. Justice.
4996,"New strategy? You want the Second Sons to attack from the west coast? If we take Casterly Rock, the Lannisters will have nowhere to run when you hit King's Landing.",You're not going to Westeros. You're staying here with the Second Sons. There's finally peace in Meereen. You will keep the peace while the people choose their own leaders.
4997,Who are you marrying this time?,I don't know. Maybe no one.
4998,But you need to lure all the noble houses to the table? Are you a queen or fish bait?,I can't bring a lover to Westeros.
4999,So that's what you want? To be my mistress?,I'm not proud. I don't care what perfumed aristocrat sits beside you in the throne room. I don't want a crown. I want you.
5000,"I'm not angry. I'm full of self-pity. Who comes after you? Who can ever follow Daenerys Stormborn, the Mother of Dragons?","A great number of women, I imagine. Specific orders will be left for you regarding the welfare of Meereen and the Bay of Dragons."
5001,Bay of Dragons?,"We can't call it Slaver's Bay anymore, can we?"
5002,"We can't call it Slaver's Bay anymore, can we?","You'll get that throne you want so badly, I'm sure of it. I hope it brings you happiness."
5003,How did he take it?,No tears.
5004,"All right, how about the fact that this is actually happening? You have your armies, you have your ships, you have your dragons. Everything you've ever wanted since you were old enough to want anything. It's all yours for the taking. Are you afraid?",Good. You're in the great game now. And the great game's terrifying. The only people who aren't afraid of failure are madmen like your father.
5005,Do you know what frightens me? I said farewell to a man who loves me. A man I thought I cared for. And I felt nothing. Just impatient to get on with it.,He wasn't the first to love you and he won't be the last.
5006,"You're not one of mine, are you?","No, my lord."
5007,Where are my damn moron sons? Black Walder and Lothar promised to be here by midday.,"They're here, my lord."
5008,"Well, what are they doing, trimming their cunt hairs? Tell them to come here now.","But they're already here, my lord."
5009,What do you want?,I thought you knew what I wanted.
5010,"No, you weren't. Every time I'm faced with a decision, I close my eyes and see the same picture. Whenever I consider an action, I ask myself will this action help to make this picture a reality? Pull it out of my mind and into the world? And I only act if the answer is yes. A picture of me on the Iron Throne… and you by my side.",It's a pretty picture.
5011,"The past is gone for good. You can sit here mourning its departure or you can prepare for the future. You, my love, are the future of House Stark. Who should the North rally behind? A trueborn daughter of Ned and Catelyn Stark born here at Winterfell or a motherless bastard born in the south?",This is where I leave you.
5012,You're not coming with us?,"The Wall is not just ice and stone. Ancient spells were carved into its foundations. Strong magic to protect men from what lies beyond. And while it stands, the dead cannot pass. I cannot pass."
5013,Where will you go?,The great war is coming and I still fight for the living. I'll do what I can… as long as I can.
5014,Are you sure you're ready for this?,I'm the Three-Eyed Raven now. I have to be ready for this.
5015,Ned?,Lyanna.
5016,Is that you? Is that really you?,You're not a dream.
5017,Is there a maester?,"Please. Listen to me, Ned."
5018,"You're wonder why I brought you all here. After all, we just had a feast. Since when does old Walder give us two feasts in a single fortnight?","Well, it's no good being lord of the Riverlands if you can't celebrate with your family. That's what I say!"
5019,You wildlings?,"I'm Meera Reed, daughter of Howland Reed. This is Brandon Stark, son of Ned Stark."
5020,How do I know that's true?,You were at the Fist of the First Men. You were at Hardhome. You've seen the Army of the Dead. You've seen the Night King. He's coming for us. For all of us.
5021,You expect me to put a spear in my granddaughter's hand?,"I don't plan on knitting by the fire while men fight for me. I might be small, Lord Glover, and I might be a girl, but I am every bit as much a Northerner as you."
5022,You want us to man the castles for you?,Last time we saw the Night King was at Hardhome. The closest castle to Hardhome is Eastwatch-by-the-Sea.
5023,So there's no punishment for treason and no reward for loyalty?,The punishment for treason is death. Smalljon Umber died on the field of battle. Harald Karstark died on the field of battle.
5024,"Yesterday's wars don't matter anymore. The North needs to band together, all the living north. Will you stand beside me, Ned and Alys, now and always?",Now and always!
5025,Will you start wearing a crown?,"When you question my decisions in front of the other lords and ladies, you undermine me."
5026,So I can't question your decisions anymore?,"Of course you can, but--"
5027,Joffrey never let anyone question his authority. You think he was a good king?,Do you think I'm Joffrey?
5028,Do you think I'm Joffrey?,You're as far from Joffrey as anyone I've ever met.
5029,At what?,At ruling.
5030,Why are you laughing?,"What did father used to say? Everything before the word ""but"" is horse shit."
5031,"What did father used to say? Everything before the word ""but"" is horse shit.",He never said that to me.
5032,And how should I be smarter? By listening to you?,Would that be so terrible?
5033,Would that be so terrible?,"A raven from King's Landing, Your Grace."
5034,What does she want?,Come to King's Landing. Bend the knee or suffer the fate of all traitors.
5035,What is this?,"Its what we've been waiting for our whole lives. It's what Father trained us for, whether he knew it or not."
5036,You've been quiet since you came home. Are you angry with me?,"No, not angry."
5037,Are you afraid of me?,Should I be?
5038,Should I be?,"Daenerys Targaryen has chosen Tyrion to be her Hand. Right now, they're sailing across the Narrow Sea, hoping to take back her father's throne. Our little brother, the one you love so much, the one you set free, the one who murdered our father and our first-born son, now he stands beside our enemies and gives them counsel. He's out there somewhere at the head of an armada. Where will they land?"
5039,"Daenerys Targaryen has chosen Tyrion to be her Hand. Right now, they're sailing across the Narrow Sea, hoping to take back her father's throne. Our little brother, the one you love so much, the one you set free, the one who murdered our father and our first-born son, now he stands beside our enemies and gives them counsel. He's out there somewhere at the head of an armada. Where will they land?",Dragonstone.
5040,Enemies to the north. Ned Stark's bastard has been named King in the North and that murdering whore Sansa stands beside him. Enemies everywhere. We're surrounded by traitors. You're in command of the Lannister army now. How do we proceed?,"Winter is here. We can't win a war if we can't feed our men and our horses. The Tyrells have the grain, the Tyrells have the livestock."
5041,Will the Tyrell bannermen stand alongside a Dothraki horde and Unsullied slave soldiers?,"If they think Daenerys will win. No one wants to fight on the losing side. Right now, we look like the losing side."
5042,A dynasty for whom? Our children are dead. We're the last of us.,"A dynasty for us, then."
5043,"He betrayed me. He betrayed us both. Should we spend our days mourning the dead--mother, father, and all our children?",Cersei--
5044,Even Lannisters can't survive without allies. Where are our allies now? You saw what happened to Walder Frey and his family.,I heard. How could we ever trust a man like that?
5045,I heard. How could we ever trust a man like that?,"We couldn't. He was a useless, old coward, but the Freys supported us. Now they're all dead. Whoever killed them is no friend of ours. We need allies. Stronger, better allies. We can't win this war alone."
5046,You think I listened to Father for 40 years and learned nothing?,The Greyjoys? You invited the Greyjoys to King's Landing?
5047,The Greyjoys? You invited the Greyjoys to King's Landing?,Not all of them.
5048,How are they better allies? How are they different from the Freys? They both broke their promises and murdered their former friends as soon as it suited them.,"So does everyone when it suits them. Unlike the Freys, they have ships. And they're good at killing."
5049,"Oh, what did he come here for, then?",A queen.
5050,"You're not a rightful monarch, though, are you?","The Greyjoys rebelled agains the throne for the right to be monarchs, but as I recall, you were soundly defeated. Come to mention it, weren't you the one who started that rebellion by sailing to Casterly Rock and burning the Lannister fleet? You certainly caught us there. Very smart move on your part. Of course, we all made it to the Iron Islands anyway. I was there."
5051,"The Greyjoys rebelled agains the throne for the right to be monarchs, but as I recall, you were soundly defeated. Come to mention it, weren't you the one who started that rebellion by sailing to Casterly Rock and burning the Lannister fleet? You certainly caught us there. Very smart move on your part. Of course, we all made it to the Iron Islands anyway. I was there.","I remember very well. I saw you. I heard so much talk. The best in the world. No one can stop him. I didn't believe it, to be honesty. But I must say, when you rushed through the breach and started cutting people down...it was glorious. Like a dance."
5052,What do you want in return?,"Ever since I was a little boy, I wanted to grow up and mary the most beautiful woman in the world. So here I am, with a thousand ships and two good hands."
5053,Why?,You're not trustworthy. You've broken promises to allies before and murdered them at the nearest opportunity. You murdered your own brother.
5054,What's the weight?,"Um, 147."
5055,That area is reserved for maesters. Are you a maester?,No.
5056,"Not a very strong proposition, is it?","Archmaester, with respect, I've seen them--the Army of the Dead. The white walkers. W was sent here to learn how to defeat them, but everyone in the Citadel, those who will even talk to me, they all doubt the walkers ever existed in the first place."
5057,Sources in the restricted area?,The very same. And the simplest explanation for your grating obsession with the white walkers is that you're telling the truth and that you saw what you say you saw.
5058,I do. You'll finish weighing that heart?,That makes you the only person south of the Twins who does.
5059,"We're not lie the people south of the Twins. And we're not like the people north of the Twins. In the Citadel, we lead different lives for different reasons. We are this worldo s memory, Samwell Tarly. Without us, men would be little better than dogs. Don't remember any meal but the last, can't see forward to any but the next. And every time you leave the house and shut the door, they howl like you're gone forever. When Robert's Rebellion was raging, people that the end was near. The end of the Targaryen dynasty. ""How will we survive?"" When Aegon Targaryen turned his eye westward and flew his dragons to Blackwater Rush--""The end is near! How will we survive?"" And thousands of year before that, during the Long Night, we can forgive them for thinking it truly was the end. But it wasn't. None of it was. The Wall has stood through it all. And every winter that ever came has ended.",Be a good lad. Clean this up.
5060,"What do you want, Lord Baelish?",I want you to be happy. I want you to be safe.
5061,What about happy? Why aren't you happy? What do you want that you do not have?,"At the moment, peace and quiet."
5062,Why is he still here?,"We need his men. Without the Vale, Ramsay Bolton would still hold this castle. Littlefinger saved us."
5063,Are you hungry? We've got some rabbit.,I don't want to steal your food.
5064,You heading south?,King's Landing.
5065,"Not so bad, is it?","Depends on your taste, I guess. If you like your streets covered in shit and pig's blood, it's the town for you."
5066,What are you doing in the Riverlands?,"There's been some trouble with the Freys up at The Twins, so we're part of the army that's been sent to keep the peace."
5067,Boy or girl?,"Oh, who knows? You think soldiers get ravens with news from home?"
5068,"Oh, who knows? You think soldiers get ravens with news from home?",I hope it's a girl.
5069,Why?,Girls take care of their papas when their papas grow old. Boys just go off to fight in someone else's wars.
5070,Are you old enough to drink?,It's blackberry wine. I made it myself.
5071,"So, why is a nice girl on her own heading to King's Landing?",I'm going to kill the queen.
5072,"You've got real powerful magic to figure that out. Did the Lord of Light whisper that in your ear? ""It's snowing, Thoros. It's windy. It's gonna be a cold night.""","You're a grouchy old bear, aren't you, Clegane? You want some rum?"
5073,"You're a grouchy old bear, aren't you, Clegane? You want some rum?",Don't like that shit. It's too sweet.
5074,Why are you always in such a foul mood?,Experience.
5075,How do you think it ended for them?,With death.
5076,"So why does the Lord of Light keep bringing you back? I've met better men than you, and they've been hanged from crossbeams, or beheaded, or just shat themselves to death in a field somewhere. None of them came back. So, why you?",You think I don't ask myself that? Every hour of every day? Why am I here? What am I supposed to do? What does the Lord see in me?
5077,You think I don't ask myself that? Every hour of every day? Why am I here? What am I supposed to do? What does the Lord see in me?,And?
5078,And?,I don't know. I don't understand our Lord.
5079,"If he's so all-powerful, why doesn't he just tell you what the fuck he wants?",Clegane.
5080,What do you want?,Look into the flames.
5081,You saw me bring him back from the dead after you cut him down. Don't you want to know what gave me the power?,I keep asking and no one wants to tell me.
5082,What do you see?,Logs burning.
5083,Keep looking. What do you see?,Ice. A wall of ice. The Wall.
5084,What else?,It's where the Wall meets the sea. There's a castle there.
5085,"Do you believe me now, Clegane? Do you believe we're here for a reason?","What the hell are you doing, Clegane?"
5086,"What the hell are you doing, Clegane?",Burying the dead.
5087,What is it?,It's a map of Dragonstone. The Targaryens built their first stronghold there when they invaded Westeros.
5088,That's dragonglass?,"A mountain of it. Beneath the ground. Stannis told me, but I didn't think... This is important. Jon needs to know."
5089,Has she come yet?,Who?
5090,Who?,The Dragon Queen. Daenerys Stormborn.
5091,Shall we begin?,"On a night like this, you came into the world."
5092,They cry out for their true queen? They drink secret toasts to my health?,"People used to tell my brother that sort of thing, and he was stupid enough to believe them."
5093,"You served my father, didn't you, Lord Varys?",I did.
5094,And then you served the man who overthrew him?,"I had a choice, Your Grace--serve Robert Baratheon or face the headman's axe."
5095,"Before I came to power, you favored my brother. All your spies, your little birds, did they tell you Viserys was cruel, stupid, and weak? Would those qualities have made for a good king in your learned opinion?","Until your marriage to Khal Drogo, Your Grace, I knew nothing about you, save your existence and that you were said to be beautiful."
5096,Who gave the order to kill me?,King Robert.
5097,Who hired the assassins?,Who sent word to Essos to murder Daenerys Targaryen?
5098,Who sent word to Essos to murder Daenerys Targaryen?,"Your Grace, I did what had to be done to--"
5099,"Proven himself loyal? Quite the opposite. If he dislikes one monarch, he conspires to crown the next one. What king of a servant is that?","The kind the realm needs. Incompetence should not be rewarded with blind loyalty. As long as I have my eyes, I'll use them. I wasn't born into a great house. I came from nothing. I was sold as a slave and carved up as an offering. When I was a child, I lived in alleys, gutters, abandoned houses. You wish to know where my true loyalties lie? Not with any king or queen, but with the people. The people who suffer under despots and prosper under just rule. The people whose hearts you aim to win. If you demand blind allegiance, I respect your wishes. Grey Worm can behead me or your dragons can devour me. But if you let me live, I will serve you well. I will dedicate myself to seeing you on the Iron Throne because I choose you. Because I know the people have no better chance than you."
5100,"The kind the realm needs. Incompetence should not be rewarded with blind loyalty. As long as I have my eyes, I'll use them. I wasn't born into a great house. I came from nothing.

I will dedicate myself to seeing you on the Iron Throne because I choose you. Because I know the people have no better chance than you.","Swear this to me, Varys. If you ever think I'm failing the people, you won't conspire behind my back. You'll look me in the eye as you have done today, and you'll tell me how I'm failing them."
5101,The Red Priests helped bring peace to Meereen. You are very welcome here. What is your name?,I am called Melisandre.
5102,"She once served another who wanted the Iron Throne. It didn't end well for Stannis Baratheon, did it?","No, it didn't."
5103,"The Lord of Light doesn't have many followers in Westeros, does he?",Not yet. But even those who don't worship the Lord can serve his cause.
5104,What does your Lord expect from me?,The Long Night is coming. Only the prince who was promised can bring the dawn.
5105,"Doesn't really roll off the tongue, does it?","No, but I like it better."
5106,And you believe this prophecy refers to me?,"Prophecies are dangerous things. I believe you have a role to play, as does another. The King in the North, Jon Snow."
5107,Jon Snow? Ned Stark's bastard?,You know him?
5108,You know him?,I traveled with him to the Wall when he joined the Night's Watch.
5109,"And why do you think the Lord of Light singled out this Jon Snow aside from the visions you've seen in the flames, that is?",As Lord Commander of the Night's Watch he allowed the Wildlings south of the Wall to protect them from great danger. As King in the North he has united those Wildlings with the northern houses so together they may face their common enemy.
5110,Do you think it's really Tyrion? It could be someone trying to lure you into a trap.,Read the last bit.
5111,"All dwarfs are bastards in their father's eyes."" What does that mean?",It's something he said to me the first night we met. You know him better than any of us. What do you think?
5112,It's something he said to me the first night we met. You know him better than any of us. What do you think?,"Tyrion is not like the other Lannisters. He was always kind to me, but it's too great a risk. ""The Seven Kingdoms will bleed as long as Cersei sits on the Iron Throne. Join us. Together we can end her tyranny."""
5113,What?,"Fire kills Whites, you told me. What breathes fire?"
5114,"Fire kills Whites, you told me. What breathes fire?",You're not suggesting Jon meet with her?
5115,You're not suggesting Jon meet with her?,"No, too dangerous."
5116,But?,"But if the Army of the Dead makes it passed the Wall, do we have enough men to fight them?"
5117,"But if the Army of the Dead makes it passed the Wall, do we have enough men to fight them?","If the Mad King's daughter takes the Iron Throne, she will destroy the Realm as we know it. Some of you are bannermen of House Tyrell. But House Tyrell is in open rebellion against the Crown. With their help the Mad King's daughter has ferried an army of savages to our shores. Mindless Unsullied soldiers who will destroy your castles and your holdfasts. Dothraki heathens who will burn your villages to the ground, rape and enslave your women, and butcher your children without a second thought. This is how Olenna Tyrell rewards centuries of service and loyalty."
5118,"She has three full-grown dragons, Your Grace. The same as Aegon when he conquered the Seven Kingdoms. How do you propose to stop them?","We are currently at work on a solution, My Lord."
5119,"Rickon, isn't it?",Dickon.
5120,Do you ride for Hornhill today?,I have an army to mobilize. It won't be long until the fighting starts.
5121,And what side will you be fighting for? You were the only man to defeat Robert Baratheon in battle. Not even Rhaegar Targaryen could --,"It's a long ride back to the reach, Ser Jaime. How may I serve?"
5122,"It's a long ride back to the reach, Ser Jaime. How may I serve?",I want you to be my ranking general in the wars to come. I want you to swear allegiance to Cersei and I want you to help her destroy her enemies. All of her enemies.
5123,Including Olenna Tyrell? I'm a Tarley. That name means something. We're not oath breakers. We're not schemers. We don't stab our rivals in the back or cut their throats at weddings. I swore an oath to House Tyrell.,"You swore an oath to the Crown as well, Lord Tarley."
5124,"She was a great woman, once. Now she's broken. She wants revenge so badly she brought the Dothraki to our shores. The Dothraki in Westeros for the first time in history. I know you don't like my sister, but you have to make a choice. Do you fight with us or with the foreign savages and eunuchs?",When the war is won the queen will need a new warden of the south. I can think of no better man than Randyll Tarley.
5125,How long?,"It will be years before it kills you. It could be 10, could be 20."
5126,"Your mind? Six months, maybe fewer.","Pardon, Archmaester. I met Stannis Baratheon's daughter at Castle Black. She had Greyscale as a baby and was cured. Isn't there some way --"
5127,Does this look like a baby to you?,No.
5128,Have you studied the varying rates of Greyscale progression in infants and fully grown men?,Maester Chrissen discovered Shireen Baratheon's affliction immediately.
5129,Mormont?,There's no need. I've been dead to them for years.
5130,"Have you ever been down here, Your Grace?","No, I can't say I have. I haven't seen these since Robert had them removed from the Throne Room."
5131,"That's very nice to hear. Of course, I can't remember a queen who was better loved than my grand daughter. The common people loved her, the nobles loved her. And what is left of her now? Ashes. Commoners, nobles, they're all just children really. They won't obey you unless they fear you.","I'm grateful to you, Lady Olenna, for your council. I'm grateful to all of you. But you have chosen to follow me. I will not attack King's Landing. We will not attack King's Landing."
5132,Then how do you mean to take the Iron Throne? By asking nicely?,We will lay siege to the capital surrounding the city on all sides. Cersei will have the Iron Throne but no food for her army or the people.
5133,And I suppose we're providing the Westerosi?,You are.
5134,"So, your master plan is to use our armies? Forgive me for asking, but why did you bother to bring your own?",The unsullied will have another objective. For decades House Lannister has been the true power in Westeros. And the seat of that power is Casterly Rock. Grey Worm and the Unsullied will sail for the Rock and take it.
5135,Do I have your support?,You have mine.
5136,"Thank you all. Lady Olenna, may I speak with you alone?",I realize you're here out of hatred for Cersei and not love for me. But I swear to you she will pay for what she's done and we will bring peace back to Westeros.
5137,"Peace. Do you think that's what we had under your father or his father or his? Peace never lasts, my dear. Would you take a bit of advice from an old woman?","He's a clever man, your Hand. I've known a great many clever men. I've outlived them all. Do you know why? I ignored them. The lords of Westeros are sheep. Are you a sheep? No. You're a dragon. Be a dragon."
5138,"He's a clever man, your Hand. I've known a great many clever men. I've outlived them all. Do you know why? I ignored them. The lords of Westeros are sheep. Are you a sheep? No. You're a dragon. Be a dragon.",Enter.
5139,You leave tomorrow. Were you going to say goodbye?,I will see you when I return.
5140,Why?,You know why.
5141,That's what I am? Your weakness?,"When Unsullied are young their masters learn their fears. One boy is scared of dogs. One boy hates high places. One is frightened of the ocean. They make the boy sleep with dogs or climb a cliff. They throw him in the water. If he learns to swim, good. If he drowns, good. Either way, strong Unsullied. But I had no fears. I was never the biggest, never the strongest, but I was bravest always."
5142,What? You don't like the title? What would you call it then?,Possibly something a bit more poetic?
5143,Possibly something a bit more poetic?,"We're not poets, Tarley."
5144,"Oh, you are?",Yes. Should I tell you how he died? From Greyscale.
5145,Yes. Should I tell you how he died? From Greyscale.,Oh.
5146,What are you doing?,You're Jorah Mormont. You're the only son of Jeor Mormont.
5147,What is it?,"Rum. Drink it all, please. I'm afraid this is going to hurt."
5148,Have you ever done this before?,"No. No one else will try, so I'm the best you've got. Have a seat. I'm going to remove the entire layer of infected tissue, then apply a medicinal ointment to the --"
5149,"Hello, Hot Pie. Sit down. Who's that for?",Mmm. This is good.
5150,You think so? The secret is browning the butter before making the dough. Most people don't don't do that because it takes up too much time.,I didn't do that.
5151,You've been making pies?,One or two.
5152,I can't believe you're here. Did you meet the big lady?,Big lady?
5153,Big lady?,The lady knight. I figured she was a knight because she had armor on. She was looking for your sister but I told her about you. Did she ever find you?
5154,The lady knight. I figured she was a knight because she had armor on. She was looking for your sister but I told her about you. Did she ever find you?,She found me.
5155,What happened to you Ary?,You got any ale?
5156,You got any ale?,Where are you heading?
5157,Where are you heading?,King's Landing.
5158,Why?,I heard Cersei's queen now.
5159,Why would I go there? The Boltons have it.,No. The Boltons are dead.
5160,What?,Jon Snow came down from Castle Black with a Wildling army and won the Battle of the Bastards. He's King in the North now.
5161,Why would I lie about that? He's your brother right?,Thanks for the pie.
5162,Have you forgotten what happened to our grandfather? The Mad King invited him to King's Landing and roasted him alive.,I know that.
5163,Whose?,"Yours. You are my sister. You are the only Stark in Winterfell. Until I return, the north is yours."
5164,"I was sorry when he died. Your father and I had our differences but he loved Cat very much. So did I. She wasn't fond of you, was she? Well, it appears she vastly underestimated you. Your father and brothers are gone, yet here you stand King in the North. Last best hope against the coming storm.",You don't belong down here.
5165,"Not even thank you? If it weren't for me you'd have been slaughtered at that battlefield. You have many enemies, My King, but I swear to you I'm not one of them. I love Sansa as I loved her mother.",Touch my sister and I'll kill you myself.
5166,Nymeria?,"Nymeria, it's me, Arya. I'm heading north, girl, back to Winterfell. I'm finally going home. Come with me."
5167,"Will you shut up about Momma? Momma, momma.",Maybe I'll kill you both before we take King's Landing and then I won't have to share.
5168,"How can you drink this piss? When we reach Sunspear I'll treat you to a Dornish red, the best in the world. Have you ever been to Dorne?",A few times. Never stayed long.
5169,A boy in every port?,"A boy, a girl. Depends on the port."
5170,Could we get some more?,I thought it wasn't for you.
5171,"And what will you be, handsome?",Whatever my queen demands.
5172,Why are you standing all the way over there then? A foreign invasion is under way. It seems like you don't need a protector.,Stay here.
5173,Where are you from? I can't place the accent.,I was born on the Island of Naarth.
5174,Does she miss me terribly?,A sham marriage and unconsummated.
5175,I wondered why you weren't there to meet our guests. You begged us to summon the King in the North. Don't you want to see him again?,I've done my part. I've brought ice and fire together.
5176,Why?,Because of mistakes I made. Terrible mistakes. I would only be a distraction if I stayed.
5177,So where will you go?,Volantis.
5178,"Forgive me, Ser Davos. I never did receive a formal education, but I could have sworn the last King in the North was Torren Stark who bent the knee to my ancestor Aegon Targaryen in exchange for his life and the lives of the northmen. Torren Stark swore fealty to House Targaryen in perpetuity. But do I have my facts wrong?","I wasn't there, Your Grace."
5179,"No. Of course not. But still, an oath is an oath. In perpetuity means -- what does perpetuity mean, Lord Tyrion?",Forever.
5180,"Oh. Well, that is unfortunate. You've travelled all this way to break faith with House Targaryen?",Break faith? Your father burned my grandfather alive. He burned my uncle alive. He would have burned the Seven Kingdoms.
5181,Break faith? Your father burned my grandfather alive. He burned my uncle alive. He would have burned the Seven Kingdoms.,"My father was an evil man. On behalf of House Targaryen I ask your forgiveness for the crimes he committed against your family. And I ask you not to judge a daughter by the sins of her father. Our two houses were allies for centuries. Those were the best centuries the kingdom's ever known. Centuries of peace and prosperity with the Targaryens sitting on the Iron Throne and a Stark serving as Warden of the North. I am the last Targaryen, Jon Snow. Honor the pledge your ancestor made to mine. Bend the knee and I will name you Warden of the North. Together we will save this country from those who would destroy it."
5182,Then why are you here?,Because I need your help and you need mine.
5183,Did you see three dragons flying overhead when you arrived?,I did.
5184,"And did you see the Dothraki, all of whom have sworn to kill for me?",They're hard to miss.
5185,"But still, I need your help?","Not to defeat Cersei. You could storm King's Landing tomorrow and the city would fall. Hell, we almost took it and we didn't even have dragons."
5186,But you haven't stormed King's Landing. Why not? The only reason I can see is you don't want to kill thousands of innocent people. It's the fastest way to win the war but you won't do it. Which means at the very least you're better than Cersei.,"Still, that doesn't explain why I need your help."
5187,The dead?,Is that another figure of speech?
5188,Is that another figure of speech?,The Army of the Dead is on the march.
5189,The Army of the Dead?,"You don't know me well, My Lord, but do you think I am a liar or a madman?"
5190,"You don't know me well, My Lord, but do you think I am a liar or a madman?","No, I don't think you're either of those things."
5191,"We fled before Robert's assassins could find us. Robert was your father's best friend, no? I wonder if your father knew his best friend sent assassins to murder a baby girl in her crib. Not that it matters now of course. I spent my life in foreign lands. So many men have tried to kill me. I don't remember all of their names. I have been sold like a brood mare. I have been chained and betrayed, raped and defiled. Do you know what kept me standing through all those years in exile? Faith. Not in any gods. Not in myths and legends. In myself. In Daenerys Targaryen. The world hadn't seen a dragon in centuries until my children were born. The Dothraki hadn't crossed the sea. Any sea.",They did for me. I was born to rule the Seven Kingdoms. And I will.
5192,And why would I do that?,"I mean no offense, Your Grace, but I don't know you. As far as I can tell your claim to the throne rests entirely on your father's name. And my own father fought to overthrow the Mad King. The lords of the north placed their trust in me to lead them. And I will continue to do so as well as I can."
5193,Am I your prisoner?,Not yet.
5194,And?,Two or three ships escaped. The rest sunk our captured. Ellaria and the sand snakes dead or captured. The Greyjoys are dead or captured.
5195,All of them?,Your sister's dead?
5196,Your sister's dead?,Euron has her.
5197,You saw him take her? And you got away?,I couldn't save her. I tried.
5198,"I have to be honest, it's making me hard. Did you see little Theon's face right before he jumped overboard?",Oh no!
5199,"There's nothing quite like it, is there? The love of the people. I suppose you wouldn't know.","This same mob spat at my sister not long ago, and if you turn on us, they'll cheer to see your head mounted on a spike."
5200,Advice?,Does she like it gentle or rough? A finger in the bum?
5201,Does she like it gentle or rough? A finger in the bum?,"Shhh, shhh, shhh, not now. We'll talk later."
5202,"The sound of your scream. I never heard a sound like that. I thought, that's true love. Oberyn looked beautiful that day. He really did. No one moved like him. No one had such skill with a spear. Even Ser Gregor couldn't stop him. If only he hadn't taunted him. He could have walked away and left poor Ser Gregor to die. But that wasn't your lover's way, was it? Now he's burried somewhere. And here Ser Gregor is stronger than ever. That must be difficult for you. When my daughter was taken from me, my only daughter, well, you can't imagine how that feels unless you've lost a child. I fed her at my own breast even though they told me to give her to the wet nurse. I couldn't bear to see her in another woman's arms. I never got to have a mother. But Myrcella did. She was mine and you took her from me. Why did you do that?",It doesn't matter now.
5203,"Do you feel powerful now? I don't sleep very well, not at all really. I lie in bed and I stare at the canopy and imagine ways of killing my enemies. How to destroy Ellaria Sand, the woman who murdered my only daughter. I thought about having Ser Gregor crush your skull the way he did Oberyn's. It would be poetic I suppose but fast. Too fast.",I thought about having him crush your daughter's skull.
5204,"Qyburn, he's the cleverest man I know. Clever enough to learn what poison you used to murder Myrcella. The long goodbye, was that it?",The Long Farewell.
5205,How long does the poison take?,"Difficult to say. Hours, days, it depends on the subject's constitution."
5206,But death is certain?,"Oh yes, Your Grace, quite certain."
5207,What are you doing? No one can see us like this ?,I am queen of the Seven Kingdoms. I'll do as I please.
5208,For now. Daenerys Targaryen has three full grown dragons. How well do wooden ships fare against fire breathing dragons?,"Her dragons might not be as invulnerable as some think. Now, let's talk about the Targaryen girl. You want to invest in her? I'm guessing the Iron Bank invested considerable gold in the slave trade. How are you profits now that Daenerys has freed all the slaves?"
5209,"Her dragons might not be as invulnerable as some think. Now, let's talk about the Targaryen girl. You want to invest in her? I'm guessing the Iron Bank invested considerable gold in the slave trade. How are you profits now that Daenerys has freed all the slaves?","The slave trade has entered a down turn, it's true."
5210,From what I gather she considers herself more of a revolutionary that a monarch. In your experience how do bankers usually fare with revoltionaries?,The Lannisters owe the Iron Bank quite a lot of money but Lannisters always pay their debts. Do former slaves or Dothraki or dragons?
5211,The Lannisters owe the Iron Bank quite a lot of money but Lannisters always pay their debts. Do former slaves or Dothraki or dragons?,Your father's daughter indeed.
5212,You didn't before. Grumpkins and snarks you called them. Do you remember? You said it was all nonsense.,"It was all nonsense. Everybody knew it. But then Mormont saw them and you saw them, and I trust the eyes of an honest man more than I trust what everybody knows."
5213,How do I convince people who don't know me that an enemey they don't believe in is coming to kill them all?,Good question.
5214,So do you have anything reasonable to ask?,What do you mean?
5215,What do you mean?,Maybe you are a northern fool. I'm asking if there's something I can do to help you.
5216,Dragonglass?,"Yes. Volcanic glass, obsidian. He says you have a tremendous amount of it here."
5217,Why are we talking about glass? We just lost two of our allies.,"Which is why I was speaking to Jon Snow, a potential ally."
5218,And what does the King in the North want with Dragonglass?,"Apparently it can be turned into weapons that kill White Walkers and their foot soldiers, or stop them, destroy them. I'm unsure of the nomenclature."
5219,And what do you think of this Army of the Dead and White Walkers and Night Kings?,"I'd very much like to believe that Jon Snow is wrong, but a wise man once said that you should never believe a thing simply because you want to believe it."
5220,Which wise man said this?,I don't remember.
5221,Are you trying to present your own statements as ancient wisdom?,"I would never do that...to you. The reason I believe Jon Snow is because he's here. All of his advisors would have told him not to come. I would have told him not to come, yet he's here anyway. You don't have to believe him. Let him mine the Dragonglass. If he's wrong it's worthless. You didn't even know it was here. It's nothing to you. Give him something by giving him nothing. Take a step toward a more productive relationship with a possible ally. Keep him occupied while we focus on the task at hand. Casterly Rock."
5222,What was that Ser Davos said about taking a knife in the heart for his people? Did you notice that?,You must allow them their flights of fancy. It's dreary in the north.
5223,You lost two brothers as well?,People thought dragons were gone forever but here they are. Perhaps we should all be examining what we think we know.
5224,You've been talking to Tyrion?,He is my Hand.
5225,So you believe me then about the Night King and the Army of the Dead?,"You better get to work, Jon Snow."
5226,How much do we have?,"4,000 bushels, My Lady."
5227,What does that mean?,"For the current occupants of the castle it's enough food for a year, perhaps more."
5228,What's the longest winter in the past 100 years?,I'm not entirely certain. I'll check Maester Llewyn's records. He kept a copy of every raven scroll.
5229,"Maester Wolkan, you'll see to it?",Are they covering those breastplates in leather?
5230,Are they covering those breastplates in leather?,"No, My Lady."
5231,"Well, shouldn't they be once the real cold comes?","They should indeed. Pardon me, My Lady."
5232,"You there, why isn't there leather on these?",Command suits you. The northerns are all facing north worried about the threat beyond the wall.
5233,"That the woman who murdered my mother, father and brother is dangerous? Thank you for your wise council.","One of two things will happen. Either the dead will defeat the living, in which case all our troubles come to an end. Or life will win out. And what then?"
5234,"One of two things will happen. Either the dead will defeat the living, in which case all our troubles come to an end. Or life will win out. And what then?","Don't fight in the north or the south. Fight every battle everywhere always in your mind. Everyone is your enemy, everyone is your friend, every possible series of events is happening all at once. Live that way and nothing will surprise you. Everything that happens will be something that you've seen before."
5235,How do you know all of this?,The three-eyed raven taught me.
5236,Hmm. Does it hurt?,A bit. Less than before.
5237,"The climate? You're free to go, Ser. This chamber is needed for the infectious, which you are no longer.","Tarley, I'd like to speak with you in my study this evening."
5238,How bad is it?,I suppose I'll find out this evening.
5239,Where will you go?,I surrendered to this sickness the moment I first saw it. I knew it would kill me or I'd kill myself before it could. Daenerys Stormborn convinced me otherwise. The only place for me is with her.
5240,Perhaps our paths will cross again?,I hope they do.
5241,You treated him?,Yes.
5242,Who told you to treat him?,No one.
5243,Who forbade you or anyone to attempt to treat him?,I seem to remember you.
5244,But you treated him anyway?,I did.
5245,"I forbade it because it's dangerous and rarely successful. Especially on someone of that age. You could have infected yourself and others. You could have devastated the entire Citadel. But you didn't. It's a meticulous, difficult procedure. Many maesters whose chains are heavy with healing links have attempted it and failed. But you succeeded. How?",I read the books and followed the instructions.
5246,You were expecting a reward? Your reward is not being immediately expelled from the Citadel. You'd better get started. Be mindful of the paper mites. They like flesh as well.,We need to find Euron Greyjoy's fleet and sink it.
5247,"I wouldn't be alone. I'd have Drogon, Vicerion and Rhaegal. What can anyone do to them?",They can still do something to you. It only takes one arrow.
5248,What about Casterly Rock?,The Unsullied will be there soon.
5249,And what will they face?,A difficult situation. They know we're coming.
5250,Where are they? Where are the rest of the Lannisters?,It's done?
5251,It's done?,It is.
5252,And now the rains weep for our whores. Did we fight well?,I suppose as well as can be expected.
5253,So you'll just let them take it?,"For now. They won't be able to hold it. Euron Greyjoy's navy burned their ships, we emptied the larders before we left. Eventually they'll be forced to abandon their position and march all the way across Westeros."
5254,"And you took your army, your real army, and went where they weren't?",As Robb Stark did to me at Whispering Wood. There are always lessons in failures.
5255,"If he was so clever why didn't he take Highgarden the moment your gold mines ran dry? I suppose I'll be able to ask him myself soon enough. No more learning from my mistakes, eh? How will you do it? With that sword?","That was Joffrey's sword, wasn't it? Not that he ever used it. What did he call it?"
5256,"That was Joffrey's sword, wasn't it? Not that he ever used it. What did he call it?",Widow's Wail.
5257,"He really was a cunt, wasn't he? I did unspeakable things to protect my family, or watched them being done on my orders. I never lost a night's sleep over them. They were necessary. And whatever I imagined necessary for the safety of House Tyrell I did. But your sister has done things I wasn't capable of imagining. That was my prize mistake, a failure of imagination. She's a monster, you do know that?","To you, sure. To others as well. But after we've won and there's no one left to oppose us, the people living peaceful in the world she built, do you really think they'll wring their hands over the way she built it?"
5258,"To you, sure. To others as well. But after we've won and there's no one left to oppose us, the people living peaceful in the world she built, do you really think they'll wring their hands over the way she built it?",You love her. You really do love her. You poor fool. She'll be the end of you.
5259,"Possibly. Not much to be gained from discussing it with you though, is there?",What better person to discuss it with? What better guarantee could you have that the things you say will never leave this room? But perhaps you're right. If she's driven you this far it's gone beyond your control.
5260,What better person to discuss it with? What better guarantee could you have that the things you say will never leave this room? But perhaps you're right. If she's driven you this far it's gone beyond your control.,"Yes, it has."
5261,How will it happen?,Cersei had several ideas. Whipping you through the streets and beheading you in front of the Red Keep. Flaying you alive and hanging you from the walls of King's Landing. I talked her out of those.
5262,Will there be pain?,No. I made sure of that.
5263,You just won the biggest prize in the world. What could you possibly have to be upset about? Come on. You can tell me. Queen of Thorns give you one last prick in the balls before saying goodbye?,I'll save my confessions for the High Septon.
5264,"No, there isn't, is there?",There is still the question of my prize.
5265,How about that one? It's available.,You don't want Highgarden.
5266,"Oh, is that why you're so fucking glum, eh? All your new riches weighing you down?",pounds on the back of the carriage and the horses start trotting.
5267,Like what?,TARLEY and his son DICKON come riding up on horseback. RANDYLL addresses JAIME.
5268,The current harvest?,We have teams of men collecting it and more farmers in the Reach.
5269,"Ser Bronn, will you accompany the Tarleys and help them accelerate this process?",I'm not much for shoveling weight.
5270,I see a great deal of potential in that venture. I imagine that it would require outside investment?,"It will indeed. I need to expand my armies, my navies. My hand, Qyburn, had made overtures to the Golden Company in Essos."
5271,Do you know who this belonged to?,"No. That very question was what started the War of the Five Kings. In a way, that dagger made you what you are today. Forced from your home, driven out to the wilds beyond the Wall. I imagine you've seen things most men wouldn't believe."
5272,What's that?,Maester Wolkan built it for me so I can move around more easily.
5273,You're leaving?,"I don't want to leave you, but when they come I need to be with my family. And you're safe, safe as anyone can be now. You don't need me anymore."
5274,That's all you've got to say?,Thank you.
5275,Thank you?,For helping me.
5276,"Hey, oh. Where are you going?",In there. I live here.
5277,If Jon Snow is gone who is in charge of Winterfell?,"The Lady of Winterfell, Lady Stark."
5278,Which Lady Stark?,You tell us. You're the one impersonating her sister.
5279,Do I have to call you Lady Stark now?,hesitates for a moment.
5280,"It suits you, Lady Stark. Jon left you in charge?","He did. I hope he comes back soon. I remember how happy he was to see me. When he sees you, his heart will probably stop."
5281,They say you killed Joffrey. Did you?,I wish I had.
5282,Your list?,Of people I'm going to kill.
5283,How did you get back to Winterfell?,It's a long story. I imagine yours is too.
5284,You saw me?,I see quite a lot now.
5285,Why would you go back there?,Cersei is on her list of names.
5286,Who else is on your list?,Most of them are dead already.
5287,Where did you get this?,Littlefinger gave it to me.
5288,"Littlefinger, he's here?",turns to look at SANSA.
5289,Why would he give you a dagger?,He thought I'd want it.
5290,Why?,Because it was meant to kill me.
5291,The cutthroat after your fall?,Why would a cutthroat have a Valyrian steel dagger?
5292,Why would a cutthroat have a Valyrian steel dagger?,Someone very wealthy wanted me dead.
5293,What do you mean it doesn't matter?,I don't want it.
5294,Are you sure? It's Valyrian steel.,It's wasted on a cripple.
5295,What happened?,begins smirking.
5296,Many things?,Your Grace.
5297,When?,A very long time ago.
5298,Doing what? Fighting each other?,takes DAENERYS by the arm and swings her torch to another part of the wall. There is a mural of the Night King and White Walkers.
5299,And you say you can't defeat them without my armies and my dragons?,"No, I don't think I can."
5300,They will if their king does. They chose you to lead them. They chose you to protect them. Isn't their survival more important than your pride?,"and DAENERYS, DAVOS and MISSANDEI are walking out of the cave. As they exit TYRION and VARYS are standing on the beach awaiting them. DAENERYS begins addressing Tyrion."
5301,What is it?,We took Casterly Rock.
5302,Isn't it?,You'll want to discuss this amongst yourselves. Perhaps --
5303,"The right plan? Your strategy has lost us Dorne, the Iron Islands and the Reach.",If I've underestimated our enemies --
5304,"Our enemies? Your family, you mean. Perhaps you don't want to hurt them after all.",begins looking out to the ocean. Three dragons are flying in the sky over the water.
5305,My enemies are in the Red Keep. What kind of a queen am I if I'm not willing to risk my life to fight them?,A smart one.
5306,What do you think I should do?,I would never presume to --
5307,"You swore to serve both of my mother's daughters, didn't you?",nods her head in agreement.
5308,Who taught you to do that?,No one.
5309,What do you think of her?,Who?
5310,Who?,sighs
5311,A good heart? I've noticed you starring at that good heart.,"There's no time for that. I saw the Night King, Davos. I looked into his eyes. How many men do we have in the north to fight him? 10,000? Less?"
5312,"There's no time for that. I saw the Night King, Davos. I looked into his eyes. How many men do we have in the north to fight him? 10,000? Less?",Fewer.
5313,What?,and JON near the end of the path. MISSANDEI is standing along the path looking at the ocean.
5314,"King Snow, isn't it? No? That doesn't sound right. King Jon?",It doesn't matter.
5315,"Forgive me, but may I ask a question?",Of course.
5316,"Your name is Jon Snow, but your father's name was Ned Stark?",I'm a bastard. My mother and father weren't married.
5317,Is the custom different in Naarth?,We don't have marriage in Naarth so the concept of a bastard doesn't exist.
5318,Why did you leave your homeland?,I was stolen away by slavers.
5319,"If I may, how did a slave girl come to advise Daenerys Targaryen?",She bought me from my master and set me free.
5320,"That was good of her. Of course you're serving her now, aren't you?",I serve my queen because I want to serve my queen. Because I believe in her.
5321,You believe that?,"I know it. All of us who came with her from Essos, we believe in her. She's not our queen because she's the daughter of some king we never knew. She's the queen we chose."
5322,Is that a Greyjoy ship?,"GREYJOY and other Iron Born are pulling their landing boat onto the beach wading through the surf. They pull the boat onto the sand. JON SNOW, MISSANDEI, DAVOS and Dothraki guards are waiting to meet them. JON sees THEON and both men freeze and stare at each other. JON steps forward towards THEON."
5323,"Sansa, is she all right?",grabs THEON by his shirt and pulls him face to face.
5324,Your sister?,Euron has her. I came to ask the queen to help get her back.
5325,Where did she go?,All of the gold is safely through the gates of King's Landing.
5326,I hear you fought bravely at Highgarden. Your first battle?,nods his head in agreement.
5327,And?,It was glorious.
5328,Men shit themselves when they die. Didn't they teach you that at fancy lad school?,looks over at BRONN
5329,What?,Listen.
5330,Where are you?,walks to the edge of the battlefield accompanied by Dothraki guards. He can see Lannisters being slaughtered. One of the Dothraki guards begin to speak.
5331,What the fuck were you doing back there?,Ending the war by killing her.
5332,You saw the dragon between you and her?,looks incredulously at JAIME.
5333,And?,sits up and says nothing to BRONN. BRONN sits up and faces JAIME.
5334,Don't you mean we're fucked?,"No, I do not. Dragons are where our partnership ends. I'm not going to be around when those things start spitting fire on King's Landing."
5335,You will not kneel?,I already have a queen.
5336,Who are you?,A stupid boy.
5337,How many men did we lose?,We haven't done a full counting.
5338,"So what do we do? Sue for peace? I sit on her father's throne, the father you betrayed and murdered. And in her mind she's winning. What sort of offer do you think she'd make?",turns and walks away from JAIME.
5339,And this was before or after she drank the poison you so kindly provided her?,After.
5340,And you believed her?,If you were Olenna would you rather have seen your granddaughter married to Joffrey or Tommen? Which one would Margerey been better able to control? Which one would have made Olenna the true ruler of the Seven Kingdoms? She was telling the truth.
5341,If you were Olenna would you rather have seen your granddaughter married to Joffrey or Tommen? Which one would Margerey been better able to control? Which one would have made Olenna the true ruler of the Seven Kingdoms? She was telling the truth.,"looks away, then sits down."
5342,"They're beautiful, aren't they?","That wasn't the word I was thinking of, but, yes, they are. Gorgeous beasts."
5343,And?,And I have fewer enemies today than I did yesterday.
5344,You're not sure how you feel about that?,"No, I'm not."
5345,How many men did your army kill taking Winterfell back from the Boltons?,Thousands.
5346,So it was a figure of speech?,doesn't say anything. A group of Dothraki guards approach DAENERYS and speak in their native tongue.
5347,You look strong. You found a cure?,"I wouldn't be here if I hadn't. I return to your service, my queen, if you'll have me."
5348,Do you know him?,I let him through the Wall years ago. I saw him go beyond the wall.
5349,And?,"Somehow a crippled boy survived for years beyond the wall when no one else could. Not the Night's Watch, not the Wildlings, no one. Perhaps we ought to listen to what he has to say."
5350,Is he the one whose father and brother were just burned alive?,I'm afraid so.
5351,All rulers demand that people bend the knee. It's why they're rulers. She gave Tarley a choice. A man who had taken up arms against her. What else could she do?,Not burn him alive alongside his son.
5352,Who is that for?,Jon Snow.
5353,Did you read it?,It's a sealed scroll for the King in the North.
5354,What's it say?,Nothing good.
5355,And give the country to Cersei? As soon as I march away she marches in.,Perhaps not. Cersei thinks the Army of the Dead is nothing but a story made up by wet nurses to frighten children. What if we prove her wrong?
5356,Perhaps not. Cersei thinks the Army of the Dead is nothing but a story made up by wet nurses to frighten children. What if we prove her wrong?,I don't think she'll come see the dead at my invitation.
5357,Is that possible?,The first White I ever saw was brought into Castle Black from beyond the Wall.
5358,Fair point. How do you propose to find one?,pauses and stares at the ground. JORAH breaks the silence.
5359,And?,Nothing.
5360,What?,Say what you mean.
5361,Are you angry with me?,They were insulting Jon and you sat there and listened.
5362,Their opinions are important to you?,"Glover has 500 men. Royce has 2,000. Offend them and Jon loses his army."
5363,How can you even think such a horrible thing?,"You're thinking it right now. You don't want to be, but the thought just won't go away."
5364,You're not staying here?,I've got my own business in Flea Bottom.
5365,What if someone takes the boat?,Then we're fucked. Best hurry.
5366,Why down here?,I don't think you want people to see how you look swinging that thing yet.
5367,"He was going to execute me. He knew I was innocent. He didn't hate me because of anything I did, he hated me because of what I am. The little monster sent to punish him. Do you think I wanted to be born this way? Did he think I chose --",What do you want?
5368,What do you want?,Daenerys will win this war. You're a military man. You must know there is no way around it. Daenerys is not her father. She's even willing to suspend hostilities if Cersei agrees to certain terms.
5369,Weren't you worried about the Goldcloaks?,I haven't been here in years. Why should they recognize me? Sometimes I hardly do. Nothing fucks you harder than time.
5370,I haven't been here in years. Why should they recognize me? Sometimes I hardly do. Nothing fucks you harder than time.,"walks to the side of the shop and inspects a rack of swords. He pulls one, nods in approval and puts it back in its place. He turns back to GENDRY."
5371,Anybody give you any trouble?,Here I am arming Lannisters. I never get a second look. You were right. Safest place for me was right under the queen's nose.
5372,Don't you think I've been thinking about it every swing of the hammer... how happy I am making weapons for the family that killed my father? They tried to kill me.,is tossing his tools and apron to the side. He picks up a satchel and swings it over his head.
5373,Who should I say I am?,turns and notices the two guards approaching the boat. He turns and loudly addresses GENDRY.
5374,"No weapons, friends. I promise. What can I do for you?",Is that your boat?
5375,Is that your boat?,It is.
5376,Still five gold dragons?,Are you joking?
5377,Are you joking?,You must be even older than you look. 15.
5378,15?,Apiece.
5379,What's in the boat?,pauses and turns back to the guards.
5380,Wine?,Mmm.
5381,What?,"Fermented crab. One bucket of this triples the brothel's earnings for the week. A man thinks he's done, he's ready to go back to his loving family, but before he gets his britches up his lady of the hour pops a tiny spoon of that into his mouth. Five minutes later, he's back in the race. Here, have a taste."
5382,Where did you get that scar?,Fish hook. Some men you just can't teach.
5383,Perhaps there's some arrangement?,Arrangement? You gonna arrange to pay us more than Queen Cersei?
5384,Arrangement? You gonna arrange to pay us more than Queen Cersei?,"can be seen behind the backs of the guards. He slowly retrieves his hammer and creeps up behind GUARD 2. He swings his hammer and connects with the side of the guardo s head. The man drops. As GENDRY transitions onto the second guard and swings his hammer, GUARD 1 turns to look and catches a hammer blow to the face."
5385,Why was QYBURN here?,He's Hand of the Queen. Why are you here?
5386,He's Hand of the Queen. Why are you here?,I met with Tyrion.
5387,What did our brother have to say?,Daenerys wants to meet.
5388,To discuss a surrender?,To discuss an armistice.
5389,She just won a great victory. Why would she want a truce now?,Because an army of dead men is marching on the Seven Kingdoms. Tyrion claims he'll have proof.
5390,Are you going to punish him?,Tyrion?
5391,Tyrion?,Bronn.
5392,He betrayed you. He set up a meeting without your knowledge or consent. Do you think anything of importance happens in this city without me knowing?,You let it happen. Why?
5393,You let it happen. Why?,"I've come to believe that accomodation with the Dragon Queen could be in our immediate interest. She has the numbers. If we want to beat her we have to be clever. We have to fight her like father would have. Dead men, dragons and Dragon Queens, whatever stands in our way we will defeat it ourselves for our house. For this."
5394,Who will you say is the father?,You.
5395,Do you remember what father used to say about people?,The lion doesn't concern himself with the opinions of the sheep.
5396,Our fathers trusted each other. Why shouldn't we?,I saw your father once at Winterfell.
5397,Do you know how to use one?,shakes his head.
5398,This is the coin the slaver gave me when I suggested he free us and pay us. Remember?,It was supposed to last us the rest of our lives.
5399,Do you know how many steps there are in the Citadel?,No.
5400,"That's true. This High Septon Meynard, he recorded everything. He even recorded his own bowel movements. What does ""annulment"" mean?",It's when a man sets asside his lawful wife.
5401,Are you sure you want to do this? You always wanted to be a maester.,I'm tired of reading about the achievements of better men.
5402,Are you sure this is the only copy at Winterfell?,"Yes, my Lord."
5403,Isn't it your job to talk him out of stupid fucking ideas like this?,I've been failing at that job of late.
5404,How many queens are there now?,Two.
5405,And you need to convince the one with the dragons or the one who fucks her brother?,Both.
5406,How many men did you bring?,looks around the table.
5407,The big woman?,smiles and shakes his head. TORMUND is disappointed.
5408,You really want to go out there again?,You're not the only ones.
5409,Thoros?,sits up from a dark corner.
5410,You're a fucking Mormont? Like the last Lord Commander?,He was my father.
5411,"For fuck's sake, will you shut your hole. Are we coming with you or not?",Don't you want to know what we're doing?
5412,Don't you want to know what we're doing?,Is it worse than sitting in a freezing cell waiting to die?
5413,Is it worse than sitting in a freezing cell waiting to die?,He's right. We're all on the same side.
5414,How can we be?,We're all breathing.
5415,Are you all right?,faces JON and grunts.
5416,Ever been north before?,Never seen snow before.
5417,"Beautiful, eh? I can breath again. Down south the air smells like pig shit.",You've never been down south.
5418,How do you live up here? How do you keep your balls from freezing off?,"You have to keep moving. That's the secret. Walking is good, fighting is better, fucking is best."
5419,"Smart people don't come up here looking for the dead. So, you met this Dragon Queen, huh? And?",She'll only fight beside us if I bend the knee.
5420,"You spent too much time with the free folk and now you don't like kneeling. Mance Rayder was a great man, a proud man. The king beyond the wall never bent the knee. How many of his people died for his pride?","Are you still mad at us, boy?"
5421,"Are you still mad at us, boy?",You sold me to a witch.
5422,"I wanted to be one of you. I wanted to join the Brotherhood but you sold me off like a slave. Do you know what she did to me? She strapped me down on a bed, she stripped me naked --",Sounds all right so far.
5423,Was she naked too?,She needed your blood.
5424,"But they didn't, did they? So what you whinging about?",I'm not whinging.
5425,He was a good man. He deserved a better son. Were you with him at the end?,I was a prisoner of the Wildlings. But we avenged him. I want you to know that every mutineer found justice.
5426,What?,retrieves a raven scroll from her pocket and unrolls it.
5427,Did they. With a knife at your throat? Did they put you on a rack and stretch you until your bones started to pop?,You don't know what it was like. I was a child.
5428,You were there?,I was there standing in the crowd near Baelor's statue.
5429,And what did you do? Did you come running to the rescue? Did you fight off the Lannisters and save father?,I wanted to.
5430,"You should be on your knees thanking me. We're standing in Winterfell again because of me. You didn't win it back. Jon didn't win it back. He lost the Battle of the Bastards. The Knight's of the Vale won the battle and they rode north for me while you were off where, traveling the world?",I was training.
5431,Who did you show it to? Where did you find it?,"You're scared, aren't you? What are you scared of? You didn't commit any crimes. No one's going to hang you."
5432,"You're scared, aren't you? What are you scared of? You didn't commit any crimes. No one's going to hang you.",Arya --
5433,Are you scared I'll show it to Jon and he'll be angry? No. That's not Jon. He'll understand. You were just a scared little girl all alone with the wicked Lannisters.,"Do you know how happy Cersei would be if she saw us fighting? This is exactly what she wants. This is what she's always wanted, to tear us apart --"
5434,"Do you know how happy Cersei would be if she saw us fighting? This is exactly what she wants. This is what she's always wanted, to tear us apart --","The northern lords will read it. They wouldn't think much of Lady Sansa if they knew how she did Cersei's bidding. What would little Lyanna Mormont say? She's younger than you were when you wrote this. Are you going to say, ""But I was just a child""?"
5435,"The northern lords will read it. They wouldn't think much of Lady Sansa if they knew how she did Cersei's bidding. What would little Lyanna Mormont say? She's younger than you were when you wrote this. Are you going to say, ""But I was just a child""?",You're angry. Sometimes anger makes people do unfortunate things.
5436,They told me you were mean. Were you born mean or you just hate Wildlings?,I don't give two shits about Wildlings.
5437,Did you trip into the fire when you were a baby?,I didn't trip. I was pushed.
5438,Will you fuck off?,I don't think you're truly mean. You have sad eyes.
5439,Do you want to suck my dick? Is that it?,Dick?
5440,Dick?,Cock.
5441,You know her?,You're with Brienne of fucking Tarth?
5442,You're with Brienne of fucking Tarth?,"Well, not with her yet, but I see the way she looks at me."
5443,How does she look at you? Like she wants to carve you up and eat your liver?,nods.
5444,How did a mad fucker like you live this long?,I'm good at killing people.
5445,Who's that?,Your father. I suppose you favor your mother.
5446,You knew him?,Of course I did. When he was Hand he sent me off hunting for The Mountain. Your Wildling friend told me the red woman brought you back. Thoros has brought me back six times. We both serve the same lord.
5447,Why?,I don't know.
5448,So what are you fighting for?,Life. Death is the enemy. The first enemy and the last.
5449,Are you sure?,turns to THOROS and nods his head.
5450,Do you know what I like about you?,turns to look at DAENERYS.
5451,Oil?,"Pitch, my lord."
5452,How many barrels?,"500, my lord."
5453,If we live that long. Men without cocks. You wouldn't find me fighting in an army if I had no cock. What's left to fight for?,Gold?
5454,Gold?,I spent my life around soldiers. What do you think they spend that gold on?
5455,I spent my life around soldiers. What do you think they spend that gold on?,Family.
5456,How many people live here?,"A million, give or take."
5457,That's more people than the entire North crammed into that. Why would anyone want to live that way?,There's more work in the city. And the brothels are far superior.
5458,Why isn't she with them?,"I'm afraid I don't know, Your Grace. No one has seen her."
5459,And the rest of them?,They're on their way to the dragon pit now.
5460,Why did they build it?,"Dragons don't understand the difference between what is theirs and what isn't. Land, livestock, children... Letting them roam free around a city was a problem."
5461,What's in there?,Fuck off.
5462,Where?,Winterfell.
5463,Who's protecting her if you're here?,The only one that needs protecting is the one that gets in her way.
5464,"And that would be double what now, exactly?",Don't you worry about me. I'm doing all right. Looking after myself.
5465,"Are you? Helping me to arrange this meeting wasn't exactly looking after yourself, was it? You put yourself at risk.","I put yourself at risk. Important difference. It's your head Queen Cersei's offered a bag of gold for, it's not mine. Now, thanks to me, she's got two traitors' heads coming right through her door. She can lop them both off as soon as she gets tired of the clever words that pour out their pieholes. All thanks to Ser Bronn of the fucking Blackwater. If that's not looking after myself, I don't know what is."
5466,"Come on, Pod. Let's you and me go have a drink while the fancy folks talk, eh?",I left this shit city because I didn't want to die in it. Am I going to die in this shit city?
5467,I left this shit city because I didn't want to die in it. Am I going to die in this shit city?,You might.
5468,"Remember me? Yeah, you do. You're even fucking uglier than I am now. What did they do to you? Doesn't matter. That's not how it ends for you, brother.",Where is she?
5469,Where is she?,She'll be here soon.
5470,Didn't travel with you?,No.
5471,Then why are you talking? You're the smallest concern here.,Do you remember when we discussed dwarf jokes? His wasn't even good. He explained it at the end. Never explain. It always ruins it.
5472,Do you remember when we discussed dwarf jokes? His wasn't even good. He explained it at the end. Never explain. It always ruins it.,"We don't even let your kind live in the Iron Islands, you know? We kill you at birth. An act of mercy for the parents."
5473,"We don't even let your kind live in the Iron Islands, you know? We kill you at birth. An act of mercy for the parents.",Perhaps you ought to sit down.
5474,Why?,Sit down or leave.
5475,"So instead, we should settle our differences and live together in harmony for the rest of our days?",We all know that will never happen.
5476,Then why are we here?,This isn't about living in harmony. It's just about living. The same thing is coming for all of us. A general you can't negotiate with. An army that doesn't leave corpses behind on the battlefield. Lord Tyrion tells me a million people live in this city. They're about to become a million more soldiers in the Army of the Dead.
5477,That's all? Pull back my armies and stand down while you go on your monster hunt. Or while you solidify and expand your position. Hard for me to know which it is with my armies pulled back until you return and march on my capital with four times the men.,Your capital will be safe until the northern threat is dealt with. You have my word.
5478,How many?,"A hundred thousand, at least."
5479,Can they swim?,No.
5480,What are you talking about?,"I've been around the world. I've seen everything, things you couldn't imagine, and this this is the only thing I've ever seen that terrifies me."
5481,Fuck loyalty?,This goes beyond houses and honor and oaths. Talk to the queen.
5482,And tell her what?,I wish you hadn't done that.
5483,Any ideas as to how we might change that state of affairs?,"Only one. Everyone stays here, and I go and talk to my sister."
5484,You spoke with her?,"At her until she kicked me out. She thinks I was an idiot to trust you. A lot of people seem to think that, actually."
5485,"I'm about to step into a room with the most murderous woman in the world who's already tried to kill me twice, that I know of. Who's an idiot?","I suppose we should say goodbye, one idiot to another."
5486,"Oh, poor little man. Your papa was mean to you. Do you have any idea what you did when you fired that crossbow? You left us open. You laid us bare for the vultures, and the vultures came and tore us apart. You may not have killed Joffrey, but you killed Myrcella, you killed Tommen. No one wouldo ve touched them if Father--",I have never been more sorry about anything.
5487,"If there's no future, then why are we here? Why did you allow me to come?",Not to help my enemies collaborate in my destruction.
5488,What did you hope for? To make Jon Snow submit to your queen.,"Mm, not like this."
5489,Why?,Because I think she will make the world a better place.
5490,Who told you that?,The witch who murdered my husband.
5491,Has it occurred to you she might not have been a reliable source of information?,"You were right from the beginning. If I had trusted you, everything would be different."
5492,"So, what now?",I can't forget what I saw north of the Wall. And I can't pretend that Cersei won't take back half the country the moment I march north.
5493,"No, this is the way he is, the way he's always been. He never asked for my opinion. Why would he start now?",I can't believe he'd surrender the Northern crown without consulting you.
5494,What does that have to do with anything?,Jon is young and unmarried. Daenerys is young and unmarried.
5495,You think he wants to marry her?,"An alliance makes sense. Together, they'd be difficult to defeat. He was named King."
5496,"You are family, too. Would Arya really murder her own sister?",Do you know what she is now? Do you know what the Faceless Men are?
5497,Do you know what she is now? Do you know what the Faceless Men are?,"Only by reputation. They worship the God of Death, I believe. I never trust godly men."
5498,They're killers. And Arya was one of them. What do you think she's after?,She's your sister
5499,Why did she come to Winterfell?,To kill me for marrying our enemies and betraying my family.
5500,Why did she unearth the letter Cersei made you write?,To provide proof of my betrayals. To provide justification after she murders me.
5501,"And after she murders you, what does she become?",Lady
5502,"And the Unsullied? We can sail with them to White Harbor, meet the Dothraki here on the kingsroad, then ride together to Winterfell.","Perhaps you should fly to Winterfell, Your Grace. You have many enemies in the North. Thousands fell fighting your fatherAll it takes is one angry man with a crossbow. He'll see your silver hair on the kingsroad and know that one well-placed bolt will make him a hero. The man who killed the conqueror."
5503,Can I speak with you?,All right.
5504,"So, why are you still talking to me?","Load up. Load up, lads. Go on. Tide's coming in."
5505,"So, why in fuck's name should we listen to you? They say the dead can't swim. We're going to sail east, find a nice, quiet island, kill all the men, and take their wives for ourselves.",We're done with all that.
5506,Who says we are?,"Yara did. She made a pledge. We're going to find her, and we're going to set her free."
5507,Are you sure you want to do this?,It's not what I want. It's what honor demands.
5508,And what does honor demand?,That I defend my family from those who would harm us. That I defend the North from those who would betray us.
5509,You stand accused of murder. You stand accused of treason. How do you answer these charges Lord Baelish?,My sister asked you a question.
5510,"Which charges confuse you? Let's start with the simplest one you murdered our aunt, Lysa Arryn. You pushed her through the Moon Door and watched her fall. Do you deny it?",I did it to protect you.
5511,Protected me? By selling me to the Boltons?,"If we could speak alone, I can explain everything."
5512,"Sometimes when I'm trying to understand a person's motives, I play a little game. I assume the worst. What's the worst reason you have for turning me against my sisterThat's what you do, isn't it? That's what you've always done turn family against family, turn sister against sister. That's what you did to our mother.","Sansa, please."
5513,What are you doing?,Preparing the expedition north.
5514,"Expedition north? I always knew you were the stupidest Lannister. The Starks and Targaryens have united against us, and you want to fight alongside them? Are you a traitor or an idiot?",You pledged our forces to fight our common enemy.
5515,"I saw it burn. If dragons can't stop them, if Dothraki and Unsullied and Northmen can't stop them, how will our armies make a difference?","This isn't about noble houses, this is about the living and the dead!"
5516,And then what?,And then we rule.
5517,"When the fighting in the North is over, someone wins. You understand that, don't you? If the dead win, they march south and kill us all. If the living win, and we've betrayed them, they march south and kill us all!",The Targaryens and the Starks already want to kill us all. Most of them will die in the North.
5518,How many dragons did you see at the pit?,Two.
5519,What happened to the third?,"For all we know, it's guarding her fleet!"
5520,The Golden Company is not here. They're in Essos. How is a mercenary company in Essos going to help us?,Do you really think Euron Greyjoy turned tail and sailed back to the Iron Islands? Do you think he abandoned the chance to marry the queen?
5521,Do you really think Euron Greyjoy turned tail and sailed back to the Iron Islands? Do you think he abandoned the chance to marry the queen?,"You plotted with Euron Greyjoy without telling me, the commander."
5522,Treason?,Disobeying your queen
5523,"Are you going to order him to kill me? I'm the only one you have left. Our children are gone, our father",There's one more yet to come.
5524,"Oh, well, thank you, but, um, I'm not sure that I am. What happened to you beyond the Wall?",I became the Three-Eyed Raven.
5525,I can see things that happened in the past. I can see things happening now all over the world. Why did you come to Winterfell?,"Um, Jon's the one to lead the fight against the dead. I know he is. But he can't do it alone, so I've come here to help him."
5526,He's on his way back to Winterfell with Daenerys Targaryen. You you saw this in a vision?,Oh.
5527,The truth about what?,About himself. No one knows. No one but me. Jon isn't really my father's son He's the son of Rhaegar Targaryen and my aunt.
5528,Are you certain?,It's what the High Septon wrote in his private diary. I don't know why he'd lie. Is this something you can see?
5529,It's what the High Septon wrote in his private diary. I don't know why he'd lie. Is this something you can see?,"Father, Smith, Warrior, Mother, Maiden, Crone, Stranger. I am hers and she is mine from this day until the end of my days."
5530,Are you all right?,"It's just strange. In his own horrible way, I believe he loved me."
5531,Does that bother you?,I was never going to be as good a lady as you. So I had to be something else. I never could have survived what you survived.
5532,What is it?,Come on! Run! Run!
5533,"You take great offense at dwarf jokes, but love telling eunuch jokes. Why is that?","Because I have balls, and you don't."
5534,Where's Arya?,Lurking somewhere.
5535,"As soon as we heard about the Wall, I called all our banners to retreat to Winterfell. Lord Umber when can we expect your people to arrive?","We need more horses and wagons, if it please my lady."
5536,But you're not. Are you? You left Winterfell a king and came back a- I'm not sure what you are now.,A lord? Nothing at all?
5537,A lord? Nothing at all?,It's not important.
5538,Not important? We named you King in the North.,King of the North!
5539,"May I ask, how are we meant to feed the greatest army the world has ever seen? While I ensured our stores would last through winter, I didn't account for Dothraki, Unsullied and two full-grown dragons. What do dragons eat, anyway?",Whatever they want.
5540,Are these the last of the wagons?,Aye.
5541,Cersei told you her army was coming north to fight for you?,She did.
5542,And you believed her?,She has something to live for now. I believe she wants to survive.
5543,How did you sneak up on me?,How did you survive a knife through the heart?
5544,How did you survive a knife through the heart?,I didn't.
5545,Have you ever used it?,Once or twice.
5546,Jealous?,Too heavy for me.
5547,Where were you before? I couldo ve used your help with Sansa.,"She doesn't like your queen, does she?"
5548,"She doesn't like your queen, does she?",Sansa thinks she's smarter than everyone.
5549,Now you're defending her?,You?
5550,You?,I'm defending our family. So is she.
5551,Why don't you just get it over with and kill me?,But we're family. The last Greyjoys left in the world. The last ones with balls anyway.
5552,If I kill you who can I talk to? Hmm?,I've got a crew full of mutes. It gets lonely at sea.
5553,Are we in King's Landing?,Mm.
5554,"Twenty-thousand men, is it?","Yes, Your Grace. A few died in transit."
5555,Horses?,Two thousand.
5556,And elephants?,"Uh, no elephants, Your Grace."
5557,Am I most welcome here?,You are a true friend of the crown and an honored guest.
5558,How?,"I've given her justice, an army, and the Iron Fleet, yet she gives me no sign of affection. My heart is nearly broken."
5559,"Archie, was it?",And William.
5560,Tall handsome William?,"Yeah, tall handsome William."
5561,Did you?,Nearly killed it.
5562,The ginger?,That's him. Came back with his face burnt right off. He's got no eyelids now.
5563,How does he sleep with no eyelids?,"All right, can we stop talking about the fucking dragons now?"
5564,"All right, can we stop talking about the fucking dragons now?",Ser Bronn of the Blackwater.
5565,Which girl?,The queen's brothers made promises to you and broke them. Her Grace wants to rectify their mistake.
5566,"When the Citadel expelled me, I thought I would die poor and alone, but in exchange for my service, Queen Cersei made me her Hand. What would she do for the man who rids her of her treasonous brothers?",I wanted those elephants.
5567,"So, how do I compare to the fat king?",You're insulting my late husband?
5568,You're insulting my late husband?,Are you offended?
5569,Are you offended?,"Robert had a different whore every night, but he still didn't know his way around a woman's body."
5570,And the Kingslayer?,"You enjoy risking your neck, don't you?"
5571,"You enjoy risking your neck, don't you?",Life is boring.
5572,Do I please the queen?,You might be the most arrogant man I've ever met. I like that.
5573,"A proposal is what I'm proposing. On the off chance that we survive the Night King, what if the Seven Kingdoms, for once in their whole shit history, were ruled by a just woman and an honorable man?",They do make a handsome couple.
5574,What is that?,Nothing lasts.
5575,How many today?,Only eighteen goats and eleven sheep.
5576,What's the matter?,The dragons are barely eating.
5577,What's wrong with them?,They don't like the North.
5578,What if he doesn't want me to?,"Then I've enjoyed your company, Jon Snow."
5579,What do I hold onto?,Whatever you can.
5580,Gendry?,He's here.
5581,"You're saying you're good, is that it?",I'm just saying it's a tricky material to-

5584,"Is that a command, Lady Stark?",Don't call me that.
5585,Can you make it?,What do you need something like this for?
5586,What do you need something like this for?,Can you make it or not?
5587,Can you make it or not?,You already have a sword. What's that?
5588,You already have a sword. What's that?,It's Valyrian steel. I always knew you were just another rich girl.
5589,"House Glover will stand behind House Stark as we have for a thousand years."" Isn't that what he said?","I will stand behind Jon Snow,"" he said."
5590,"Do you think we can beat the Army of the Dead without her? I fought them, Sansa. Twice. You want to worry about who holds what title, I'm telling you it doesn't matter. Without her, we don't stand a chance.",Do you have any faith in me at all?
5591,Do you have any faith in me at all?,You know I do.
5592,Did you bend the knee to save the North or because you love her?,Oh!
5593,So you're the man?,"Um. Which man am I, Your Grace?"
5594,"Um. Which man am I, Your Grace?",The one who saved Ser Jorah when no one else could.
5595,For what crime?,"Um, I borrowed a few books from the Citadel."
5596,From the Citadel?,From my family. It's been in House Tarly for generations.
5597,Not Randyll Tarly?,You know him?
5598,You know him?,I offered to let him retain his lands and titles if he bent the knee. He refused.
5599,"Hm. Thank you, Your Grace. For telling me. And m- may I?",Of course.
5600,What are you doing out here?,"Waiting, for an old friend. It's time to tell Jon the truth."
5601,"No, no. You're his brother. Shouldn't you tell him?",I'm not his brother. He trusts you more than anyone. Now's the time.
5602,Sam?,"I'm sorry, I know I'm not supposed to be down here."

5608,Know what?,Daenerys. She executed my father and brother. They were her prisoners.
5609,Would you have done it?,"Well, I've executed men who disobeyed me."
5610,What are you talking about?,Your mother was Lyanna Stark.
5611,It's the truth. You gave up your crown to save your people. Would she do the same?,"Stay back, he's got blue eyes!"
5612,Did you find anyone?,The Umber boy.
5613,"We""?",I promised to fight for the living. I intend to keep that promise.
5614,Like you knew your sister?,"He came here alone, knowing full well how he'd be received. Why would he do that if he weren't telling the truth?"
5615,"He came here alone, knowing full well how he'd be received. Why would he do that if he weren't telling the truth?","Perhaps he trusts his little brother to defend him, right up to the moment he slits my throat."
5616,"Do you want me to apologize? I won't. We were at war. Everything I did, I did for my house and my family. I'd do it all again.",The things we do for love.
5617,So why have you abandoned your house and family now?,Because this goes beyond loyalty.
5618,You vouch for him?,I do.

5625,How many?,A few. That was enough.
5626,What are they like?,Bad. Really bad.

And I know you're not scared of rapers or murderers or-This is different. This is-this is death. You want to know what they're like? Death. That's what they're like."

5648,What is it?,My queen.
5649,Your sister?,"She only has a few ships, and she couldn't sail them here. So, she's sailing to the Iron Islands instead, to take them back in your name."

5657,"So, what can we do?",The Night King made them all. They follow his command. If he falls Getting to him may be our best chance.
5658,Why? What does he want?,"An endless night. He wants to erase this world, and I am its memory."
5659,"That's what death is, isn't it? Forgetting. Being forgotten. If we forget where we've been and what we've done, we're not men anymore. Just animals. Your memories don't come from books. Your stories aren't just stories. If I wanted to erase the world of men, I'd start with you.",How will he find you?
5660,How will he find you?,His mark is on me.
5661,You want us to use you as bait?,We're not leaving you alone out there.

5663,Do you need help?,No.
5664,"When Daenerys takes her throne there will be no place for us here. I am loyal to my queen.

5670,You really think any of us are going to sleep tonight? Join us.,All right. Just a bit.

5675,What are you doing up here?,What's it look like?
5676,What's it look like?,"No, I mean, what are you doing up here? You joined the Brotherhood. You went beyond the Wall with Jon. You're here now. Why? When was the last time you fought for anyone but yourself?"

5689,One? Two? Twenty?,"Well, I didn't keep count."

5698,Who's that?,Lyanna Stark.
5699,Who told you this?,Bran. He saw it.
5700,He saw it?,And Samwell confirmed it. He read about their marriage at the Citadel without even knowing what it meant.
5701,A secret no one in the world knew except your brother and your best friend. Doesn't seem strange to you?,"It's true, Dany. I know it is."
5702,Do you speak their tongue?,Tell them to lift their swords.
5703,What? Remember the Battle of Blackwater? I brought us through the Mud Gate.,And got your face cut in half.
5704,Why not?,The Dragon Queen. Your divided loyalties would become a problem.
5705,Go where?,Man the walls!
5706,"Fuck off! We can't beat them. Don't you see that, you stupid whore? We're fighting Death! They can't beat Death.",Tell her that.
5707,What do we say to the God of Death?,Not today.
5708,Have you seen Arya?,"You can still smell the burning bodies, and that's where your head is at."
5709,"Of course it's about that, you twat. Why shouldn't it be? The dead are dead. You're not.",Gendry.
5710,"That's right, isn't it?","Yes, Your Grace."
5711,You are aware he took my family's throne and tried to have me murdered?,I didn't even know he was my father until after he was dead.
5712,"Yes, he's dead. His brothers are too. So who's Lord of Storm's End now?","I don't know, Your Grace."
5713,Does anyone?,I think you should be Lord of Storm's End.
5714,"That's easy, isn't it?",A fitting reward for a hero.
5715,See? You're not the only one who's clever.,I have to go down and get another barrel.
5716,"We fought dead things and lived to talk about it. If this isn't the time to drink, when is?","The last time I saw her, I told her I'd kill her if I ever saw her again."
5717,So did you?,"Never got the chance. She did it to herself. Or her god did it to her. Lord of Light. We play his game for him, we fight his war and win, and then he fucks off. No signs, no blessings. Who knows what he wants?"
5718,"Never got the chance. She did it to herself. Or her god did it to her. Lord of Light. We play his game for him, we fight his war and win, and then he fucks off. No signs, no blessings. Who knows what he wants?",I don't imagine thinking about that subject will leave you any happier than before.
5719,And what if I'm not trying to be happy?,"Then you're in luck. We may have defeated them, but we still have us to contend with."
5720,And?,Nothing?
5721,Nothing?,She won't eat.
5722,Who?,Her soldiers.
5723,"What have I told you, Martha?","The greater the risk, the greater the reward."
5724,The Northern armies?,Just crossed the Trident. They'll be at the walls of King's Landing in two days. How is she?
5725,Just crossed the Trident. They'll be at the walls of King's Landing in two days. How is she?,"She hasn't seen anyone since we returned. Hasn't left her chambers, hasn't accepted any food."
5726,Aren't you worried for her?,"I'm worried for all of us. They say every time a Targaryen is born, the gods toss a coin and the world holds its breath."
5727,What do you want?,All I've ever wanted. The right ruler on the Iron Throne. I still don't know how her coin has landed. But I'm quite certain about yours.
5728,Your Grace?,There's something you need to know.
5729,And Varys?,Your Master of Whisperers needs to be aware too.
5730,Why do you think Sansa told you? What do you think she hoped to gain?,She trusts me.
5731,What did I say would happen if you told your sister?,"I don't want it, and that's what I told him."
5732,Is that all I am to you? Your queen?,"All right, then."
5733,They are. In a tyrant's grip. Whose fault is that? Mine?,What does it matter whose fault it is? Thousands of children will die if the city burns.
5734,What does it matter whose fault it is? Thousands of children will die if the city burns.,Your sister knows how to use her enemies' weaknesses against them. That's what she thinks our mercy is - weakness.
5735,"Davos. I need to ask you a favor. You're the greatest smuggler alive, aren't you?","I'm not gonna like this favor, am I?"
5736,"I'm not gonna like this favor, am I?",He's always better when he's got some food in him.
5737,Problem is when he's got drink in him. See what he did the other week?,Aye. Fighting as well. Commander nearly caught him.
5738,Ay up. Where you going?,I'm Arya Stark. I'm going to kill Queen Cersei.
5739,Where's he going?,I drink to eat the skull keeper.
5740,Ordered by whom? The queen herself?,No.
5741,How did they find you?,Did you consider taking it off?
5742,Did you consider taking it off?,"Cersei once called me ""the stupidest Lannister."""
5743,When have I ever been able to convince Cersei of anything?,"Try. If not for yourself, if not for her, then for every one of the million people in that city, innocent or otherwise."
5744,Why?,"Escape. The two of you, together. Remember where we met, where they keep the dragon skulls, beneath the Red Keep? Take her down there. Keep following the stairways down, down as far as they'll go. You'll come out onto a beach at the foot of the keep. A dinghy will be waiting for you. Sail out of the bay. If the winds are kind, you'll make it to Pentos. Start a new life."
5745,"Escape. The two of you, together. Remember where we met, where they keep the dragon skulls, beneath the Red Keep? Take her down there. Keep following the stairways down, down as far as they'll go. You'll come out onto a beach at the foot of the keep. A dinghy will be waiting for you. Sail out of the bay. If the winds are kind, you'll make it to Pentos. Start a new life.",Sail right past the Iron Fleet and into a new life? Sounds a lot less likely than Cersei winning this war-
5746,Sail right past the Iron Fleet and into a new life? Sounds a lot less likely than Cersei winning this war-,"There won't be an Iron Fleet for much longer. Do it. If you don't, you'll never see Cersei again."
5747,You think you wanted revenge a long time? I've been after it all my life.,It's all I care about. And look at me.
5748,Look at me! You wanna be like me?,"You come with me, you die here."
5749,Alanna! Alanna! Have you seen my wife? Have you seen my wife?,Let go.
5750,Have you seen my wife?,Out of the way!
5751,How much more defeated do you want them to be? They're on their knees.,They are breathing.
5752,And what are the queen's commands?,"Kill all who follow Cersei Lannister."" These are free men. They chose to fight for her."
5753,Will you break the wheel with me?,You freed your brother. You committed treason.
5754,What are you doing here?,"Hey, what happened?"
5755,"Hey, what happened?",I came to kill Cersei. Your queen got there first.
5756,Did you bring any wine?,No.
5757,So is there life after death?,Not that I've seen.
5758,"Is it? When you heard her talking to her soldiers, did she sound like someone who's done fighting?",She liberated the people of Slaver's Bay. She liberated the people of King's Landing. And she'll go on liberating until the people of the world are free and she rules them all.
5759,"You think our house words are stamped on our bodies when we're born and that's who we are? Then I'd be fire and blood too. She's not her father, no more than you're Tywin Lannister.","My father was an evil man. My sister was an evil woman. Pile up all the bodies of all the people they ever killed, there still won't be half as many as our beautiful queen slaughtered in a single day."
5760,Would you have done it?,What?
5761,What?,"You've been up there, on a dragon's back. You've had that power. Would you have burned the city down?"
5762,"You've been up there, on a dragon's back. You've had that power. Would you have burned the city down?",I don't know.
5763,What's it matter what I'd do?,"It matters more than anything. When she murdered the slavers of Astapor, I'm sure no one but the slavers complained. After all, they were evil men."
5764,"When she crucified hundreds of Meereenese nobles, who could argue? They were evil men. The Dothraki khals she burned alive? They would have done worse to her. Everywhere she goes, evil men die and we cheer her for it. And she grows more powerful and more sure that she is good and right. She believes her destiny is to build a better world for everyone. If you believed that if you truly believed it, wouldn't you kill whoever stood between you and paradise?",I know you love her. I love her too. Not as successfully as you. But I believed in her with all my heart. Love is more powerful than reason. We all know that. Look at my brother.
5765,You just came up with that?,Maester Aemon said it a long time ago.
5766,"Sometimes duty is the death of love. You are the shield that guards the realms of men. And you've always tried to do the right thing. No matter the cost, you've tried to protect people. Who is the greatest threat to the people now?",It's a terrible thing I'm asking. It's also the right thing. Do you think I'm the last man she'll execute? Who is more dangerous than the rightful heir to the Iron Throne?
5767,It's a terrible thing I'm asking. It's also the right thing. Do you think I'm the last man she'll execute? Who is more dangerous than the rightful heir to the Iron Throne?,That's her decision. She is the queen.
5768,And your sisters? Do you see them bending the knee?,My sisters will be loyal to the throne.
5769,Why do you think Sansa told me the truth about you? Because she doesn't want Dany to be queen.,She doesn't get to choose.
5770,"When I was a girl, my brother told me it was made with a thousand swords from Aegon's fallen enemies. What do a thousand swords look like in the mind of a little girl who can't count to twenty? I imagined a mountain of swords too high to climb. So many fallen enemies, you could only see the soles of Aegon's feet.",I saw them executing Lannister prisoners in the street. They said they were acting on your orders.
5771,"Necessary? Have you been down there? Have you seen? Children, little children, burned!",I tried to make peace with Cersei. She used their innocence as a weapon against me. She thought it would cripple me.
5772,And Tyrion?,"He conspired behind my back with my enemies. How have you treated people who've done the same to you, even when it broke your heart?"
5773,"He conspired behind my back with my enemies. How have you treated people who've done the same to you, even when it broke your heart?",Forgive him.
5774,How do you know? How do you know it'll be good?,Because I know what is good. And so do you.
5775,What about everyone else? All the other people who think they know what's good.,They don't get to choose.
5776,Where's Jon?,He is our prisoner.
5777,"Friends, please. We've been cutting each other's throats long enough. Torgo Nudho. Am I saying that properly?","If it weren't for you and your men, we wouldo ve lost the war with the dead. This country owes you a debt it can never repay, but let us try. There is land in the Reach. Good land. The people that used to live there are gone. Make it your own. Start your own house with the Unsullied as your bannermen. We've had enough war. Thousands of you, thousands of them. You know how it ends. We need to find a better way."
5778,Uncle? Please sit.,"Well, we have to choose someone."
5779,Why just us?,"Um- We represent all the great houses, but whomever we choose, they won't just rule over lords and ladies. Maybe the decision about what's best for everyone should be left to well, everyone."
5780,Me? The Imp?,"Half the people hate me for serving Daenerys, the other half hate me for betraying her."
5781,"Who, then?",I've had nothing to do but think these past few weeks. About our bloody history. About the mistakes we've made.
5782,"What unites people? Armies? Gold? Flags? Stories. There's nothing in the world more powerful than a good story. Nothing can stop it. No enemy can defeat it. And who has a better story than Bran the Broken? The boy who fell from a high tower and lived. He knew he'd never walk again, so he learned to fly. He crossed beyond the Wall, a crippled boy, and became the Three-Eyed Raven. He is our memory, the keeper of all our stories. The wars, weddings, births, massacres, famines. Our triumphs... mm, our defeats, our past. Who better to lead us into the future?",Bran has no interest in ruling and he can't father children.
5783,"I know you don't want it. I know you don't care about power. But I ask you now, if we choose you will you wear the crown? Will you lead the Seven Kingdoms to the best of your abilities from this day until your last day?",Why do you think I came all this way?
5784,Why do you think I came all this way?,To Brandon of House Stark... I say aye.
5785,There's still a Night's Watch?,The world will always need a home for bastards and broken men.
5786,Was it right? What I did?,What we did.
5787,I wish there had been another way. Can you forgive me?,"The North is free, thanks to you."
5788,You think anyone will dare tell you women aren't allowed?,I'm not going back north.
5789,Where are you going?,What's west of Westeros?
5790,What's west of Westeros?,No one knows. It's where all the maps stop. That's where I'm going.
5791,You have your Needle?,Right here.
5792,What's this?,A Song of Ice and Fire. Archmaester Ebrose's history of the wars following the death of King Robert. I helped him with the title.
5793,He's not kind?,He-
5794,He what? What does he say about me?,"I don't believe you're mentioned, ahem."
5795,And Drogon? Any word?,"He was last spotted flying east, toward-"
5796,"Ser Bronn of the Blackwater, Lord of Highgarden, Lord Paramount of the Reach and Master of Coin, would you say the crown's debt to you has been paid?","In full, my lord Hand."
5797,Good. Time to start incurring a new one. We have hungry people to feed. Can we expect some assistance in this regard?,Indeed we can.
5798,You Master of Grammar now too?,"Grandmaester, ahem, it is my theory, based on my years of work on the Casterly Rock sewers, that clean water leads to a healthier population."
